[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts; Mike Cavanagh; Jason Armstrong; and Dave Watson.\nI will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our safe harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties.\nIn addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comcast Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. First, I'll start with the leadership news we announced earlier this morning, which is that Steve Croney will be elevated to CEO of our Content & Experiences business at the beginning of 2026. And at that time, Dave Watson will become Vice Chairman of Comcast Corporation.\nThis will be a well-earned and seamless transition for Steve, who has already made a significant impact as Chief Operating Officer leading the operational transformation of our C&P business over the past year. He has the full trust and confidence of our entire management team and is exactly the right person to take the business forward.\nAnd I want to congratulate and thank Dave for his extraordinary leadership of the business for the past 8 years. Over more than 3 decades Dave has been an integral part of building the best connectivity business in the industry. The fact that Steve comes from inside the company also speaks to how thoughtfully Dave has developed the leaders in his organization. And I really look forward to continuing to partner with you, Dave, in your new role as Vice Chairman.\nBrian will have more to say about this leadership transition later in the call, but now let me get into the quarter. I have 2 topics to discuss, convergence and sports.\nSo starting with convergence, the broadband environment remains intensely competitive, which we do not expect to change anytime soon. Over time though, we believe that the vast majority of the broadband market will be comprised of 2 multi-gig symmetrical providers serving most addresses, and we aim to be a winner in this segment, with the rest of the market likely being served by capacity-limited alternatives.\nWe've been seeing this end state begin to take shape. Fiber expansion continues at a steady pace. And as we've said before, we expect most of our footprint will eventually be overbuilt. At the same time, fixed wireless remains a durable competitor, serving price-sensitive segments with moderate performance needs.\nAgainst this backdrop, we have adapted our approach to compete more effectively for the long term. Our strategy rests on 3 pillars: network, product and customer experience.\nOur network is built to scale and now leverages AI end-to-end to optimize performance throughout the home. This enables best-in-class WiFi, which matters more than ever as usage continues to rise. We're seeing this on our network where broadband-only customers average 800 gigs a month in the third quarter, up 9% year-over-year.\nIn product, broadband, wireless and our entertainment OS operate as one system, integrated and designed for how customers actually connect. Taken together or individually, they deliver a seamless experience that differentiates us in the marketplace.\nAnd finally, in customer experience, where we need to improve over the long term, our near-term focus is on price transparency and in making it easier to do business with us.\nWith respect to these pillars, we made meaningful progress in the quarter. First, we streamlined our organizational structure to better align with our strategy. Steve has centralized key functions such as marketing, data science and customer experience, and reduced management layers to sharpen local execution.\nSecond, we're pressing ahead on WiFi, an area where we are already recognized as a market leader. Strong, consistent WiFi remains the #1 factor driving customer choice, and this is where we excel. Opensignal recently ranked Xfinity the top provider in our footprint, outperforming Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T in reliability, download speeds and streaming.\nThis leadership comes from the technology behind our network, especially our gateways, which power the strength and consistency of the WiFi experience. During the third quarter, we began rolling out our most powerful gateway yet, the XP10, supporting multi-gig symmetrical speeds and up to 300 devices using AI to self-optimize network performance in real time. With our new national pricing, gateways are included in every package, ensuring every customer receives our best technology and an integrated experience with mobile.\nThird, we've accelerated momentum in wireless, now reaching more than 14% penetration of our broadband base and adding over 400,000 lines in the quarter, our best result yet. Xfinity Mobile is a standout growth engine for us. We're leaning in with sharper marketing, stronger brand awareness and compelling offers like a free mobile line for 1 year.\nThis was also the first full quarter of our new premium unlimited plan designed for higher-value customers that delivers what they want at $40 per line on a 2-line plan and the ability to upgrade devices twice a year with a guaranteed discount on a new phone. Our progress in mobile is clear, with meaningful product uptake, higher attachment rates across our broadband base and growing recognition of Xfinity Mobile as a leader in value and performance.\nFourth, video performance improved meaningfully this quarter with subscriber losses down more than 100,000 year-over-year, which is our best result in nearly 5 years. Churn is at record lows supported by our focus on delivering the right products for each customer segment. Our entertainment OS continues to lead the market, enhanced by features like MultiView, which allows our customers to view several live events simultaneously.\nFifth, we introduced a simpler, more transparent pricing model. As we detailed last quarter, we've moved to nationwide offers built around 4 clear speed tiers. Each plan includes our gateway, unlimited data, WiFi controls and cyber protection at a lower everyday price, backed by a 1- or 5-year price guarantee. It's a more predictable experience for the customer and a clearer value proposition in the market.\nAnd finally, we're taking meaningful steps to simplify the customer experience across all channels. Our new AI engine now supports agents, technicians and customers through assisted chat, phone, our website and our AI-enabled Xfinity Assistant platform. We also launched a program that connects customers to a live agent in seconds, which is now available to half of our customer base. It's still early, but we're moving fast and executing with focus towards a simpler, smarter and more seamless customer experience.\nSo taken together, these efforts mark tangible progress in what is an important shift to position our Connectivity business for future sustained growth. This is a deliberate investment phase, one that will take time and carry a cost as reflected in the 3.7% decline in Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA this quarter. And we expect this decline to build slightly over the next several quarters as we continue to invest in pricing, product and customer experience.\nAnd my second topic is sports. Last week's NBA tip-off marked the start of one of the biggest stretches of live sports in our history and drew the largest audience for an NBA opening double header since 2010. We're in the heart of the NFL and college football seasons and, in February, we'll have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and NBA All-Star Weekend, followed by the World Cup on Telemundo in June.\nSports remains a cornerstone of our Media business. The NBA's return to NBC and now Peacock expands both our reach and our creative opportunities. Sunday Night Basketball launches in February, modeled after the success of Sunday Night Football, which has been the #1 prime time show for 14 straight years and now averages roughly 25 million viewers.\nWe're proud of the sports portfolio we've built. Each property adds value across our entire Media ecosystem, driving NBC's distribution, helping Peacock attract and retain subscribers, and powering our advertising business. And as audiences continue to shift from linear to streaming, the multiple benefits of sports becomes an even greater advantage.\nLive sports continue to deliver strong viewership and ad performance across broadcast and streaming, momentum at Peacock remains solid and retention has held steady even after our $3 price increase. Running linear and streaming as one integrated media business gives us real scale and flexibility. It allows us to align programming, marketing promotion and monetization across NBC, Peacock and our studios. And as we near completion of the Versant spin, NBCUniversal's media business will be more focused and well positioned to grow.\nSo now let me turn it over to Jason to go over the third quarter results in more detail.\n\nJason S. Armstrong\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a high-level overview of our consolidated results before getting into more detail on our businesses.\nTotal company revenue declined about 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the tough comparison to last year's Paris Olympics. Excluding that impact, revenue increased nearly 3%, driven by strong performance across our 6 growth businesses, highlighted by nearly 20% growth in Theme Parks and 14% growth in domestic wireless.\nEBITDA and adjusted EPS were both consistent with last year, while free cash flow increased 45% to $4.9 billion. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders this quarter, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $1.2 billion in dividends, reflecting our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation.\nNow turning to our businesses, starting with Connectivity & Platforms. The competitive environment for broadband remains intense. As we've highlighted, we've made a significant pivot in our go-to-market strategy this year, focused on simplifying pricing, improving transparency and enhancing the customer experience. While it's still early, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in our broadband customer base: continued stabilization in voluntary churn, a healthy mix of customers opting into our 5-year price guarantee and nearly 40% of new connects choosing gig-plus speeds, which is up about 10 points from the start of the year.\nWe're also seeing higher utilization of our new packaging, including new everyday pricing in retention, helping transition more of the base into simplified market-based plans. And we continue to accelerate our wireless net additions this quarter to a new record high.\nAs we've said from the beginning, this pivot carries several costs, including rate reinvestment through pricing simplicity, which carries revenue dilution, as well as investment in customer experience, which carries additional operating costs. This quarter is the first quarter where these impacts are reflected in our financial results. You see it in broadband ARPU growth dilution as well as elevated marketing, product and customer service expense, all contributing to a 3.7% decline in EBITDA this quarter. As Mike mentioned, as these investments continue, we expect continued EBITDA pressure over the next several quarters until we lap this transition.\nOn the other side of this, we're positioning ourselves for growth with a more durable broadband customer base on stable market-based rate plans, combined with a larger wireless base, that gives us a very strong hand in convergence, along with meaningful monetization upside as customers roll off promotions and we expand the relationship over time. All in, our converged product offerings provide customers with substantial savings versus comparable plans from telecom competitors.\nNow let me get into some further details of the quarter. Broadband subscribers declined 104,000 in the quarter. We saw the typical seasonal benefit from back-to-school activity as well as the early traction from our new go-to-market initiatives, but this was more than offset by the continued intense competitive environment. The rollout of our new everyday pricing structure at the end of June, combined with the success of our free wireless line offer, caused a deceleration in our broadband ARPU growth, resulting in 2.6% growth this quarter. As we continue to transition customers to more consistent pricing and ramp up free wireless line additions, we expect ARPU growth to step down more than 1 point in the fourth quarter. And we expect continued pressure on ARPU in early 2026 as our current plan is to not take a rate increase in broadband in the early part of next year.\nAs we've said, this pivot we are making will take time, but it sets the foundation for a far more stable broadband base in a more challenged competitive environment, and we're confident we're on the right path.\nAnd while we invest to stabilize broadband, wireless is our core growth engine. On that note, convergence revenue grew 2.5%, supported by mid-teens growth in wireless. Wireless net additions hit a new record at 414,000, and nearly half of our residential postpaid phone connects came from customers taking a free line, which is a great way to bring new customers into the ecosystem. At the same time, we saw a strong uptake in our new premium unlimited plans, enhancing our position in the high-value postpaid market. Our total wireless lines are now approaching 9 million, with penetration of our broadband base surpassing 14%, and we're pleased with the momentum in wireless net additions. Looking ahead, in the second half of next year, many of the free lines will come up for monetization. Our intention is to convert the majority to paying relationships, which should provide a significant tailwind to convergence revenue growth at that point.\nTurning to Business Services. Consistent with prior quarters, revenue was up 6% and EBITDA grew by nearly 5% in the quarter. In the SMB segment, we're seeing elevated competition, particularly from fixed wireless. Despite this, we still delivered modest revenue growth by driving ARPU higher through increased adoption of our advanced services like cybersecurity, cloud solutions and Comcast Business Mobile.\nWhere we're seeing real momentum is in our enterprise solutions, which continues to be a key growth driver. These customers have more complex needs, and we're leaning in to deepen relationships and expand our advanced solutions mix. It's a segment where we're investing, and we expect continued strong growth.\nIn Content & Experiences, there are a few items I'd like to highlight. At Parks, we delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 19% and EBITDA growth of 13%, benefiting from the first full quarter of Epic Universe. We're really pleased with the early results from Epic, which are driving higher per cap spending and attendance across the entirety of Universal Orlando. We remain focused on expanding ride throughput as we build to run rate capacity and expect Epic to continue scaling over the next year with higher attendance, stronger per caps and improved operating leverage.\nAt Studios, we had solid theatrical results led by the strong performance of Jurassic World Rebirth early in the quarter, which has grossed nearly $900 million in worldwide box office and pushed the franchise's cumulative total to $7 billion. While this success contributed to top line growth, Studio's EBITDA was impacted by higher marketing spend tied to our larger film slate this year. Looking ahead, we're excited for a strong fourth quarter slate, including the highly anticipated release of Wicked: For Good on November 21.\nIn Media, excluding the comparison to last year's Paris Olympics which generated $1.9 billion in incremental revenue, revenue increased a healthy 4%. And on the same basis, Peacock revenue grew at a mid-teens rate driven by strength in both advertising and distribution. Advertising was up 2.6%, our best result year-to-date, fueled by sports with the strong return of Sunday Night Football. In fact, our 20th season is our highest grossing season to date. Distribution revenue grew 1.5%, supported by 25% growth at Peacock.\nOverall Media EBITDA increased 28%, driven by nearly $220 million year-over-year improvement in Peacock losses, which landed at a loss of just over $200 million in the quarter. Peacock subscribers were flat this quarter as the strength of our content slate late in the quarter as well as our strategic distribution initiatives offset the impact of additional churn from our in-quarter $3 rate hike.\nLooking ahead, the NBA just premiered on NBC and Peacock last week and is off to a great start. While we expect a positive impact on advertising and distribution revenue, it also introduces a new expense. As we've said, we'll straight-line the amortization of these sports rights, which will create some upfront dilution, particularly in the first season, with the game counts driving quarterly realization of this expense. But over time, we'll offset this through advertising growth, a recent record upfront tied to sports, including the NBA, is a good indicator, and through subscriber acquisition and monetization across both linear and Peacock. We also expect to optimize NBCUniversal programming investment across sports, entertainment and news.\nNow I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow this quarter, up significantly year-over-year. And year-to-date, we have generated $14.9 billion in free cash flow. The increase in the quarter was driven by a tailwind in cash taxes from the new legislation, along with favorable working capital timing, particularly around studio production spend, and the comparison to the Olympics. These benefits were partially offset by higher organic investment with total capital expenditures of $3.1 billion this quarter, reflecting increased spending in Connectivity & Platforms where we're investing to pass more homes, to strengthen our broadband network and to deploy our market-leading gateways into homes at a faster rate. Our gateway is now included in our broadband offers, which is a key part of our product strategy.\nOn the Content & Experiences side, capital spending declined as we're past the construction on Epic that elevated capital spending last year. Through our investments and our significant pivot in broadband, we have maintained a healthy balance sheet, ending the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x. We also returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, including over $1.5 billion in share repurchases, contributing to a mid-single-digit year-over-year decline in our share count.\nAs we look ahead to next year, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Our priorities are to invest organically in our growth businesses, maintain a strong balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. That formula has served us well and it will continue to guide our approach. At the same time, we'll stay disciplined and balanced as we move through this transition.\nWe do have some near-term headwinds, namely the EBITDA impact from our broadband repositioning, the onboarding of NBA rights and the spinoff of Versant and its associated EBITDA and free cash flow. For those reasons, we reduced our quarterly buyback pacing a touch to $1.5 billion in the quarter. I'd point out that this remains one of the strongest absolute and percentage buybacks in our broader peer group. At the same time, our healthy dividend offers a yield that is multiple times the yield of the broader market. So we believe we are balancing strong returns back to shareholders with significant reinvestment in our business, and doing so in the context of a balance sheet that provides cushion through any operating or macroeconomic environment.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian for a few remarks.\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Corp.\n\nThanks, Jason. Mike, as you referenced a moment ago, I want to talk about our recent leadership announcements. Let's start with you, Mike.\nI could not be more thrilled to have you become our co-CEO. Working side by side for over a decade, you're an incredible partner. And now especially as we manage the pivot we're making to meet the moment in all of our businesses that you just laid out so well, you are critical to navigating our plan to achieve sustainable growth for the future.\nI'm also very excited and proud for you, Dave, to become Vice Chair, working with me, Steve and all the others on the strategic initiatives as we look forward. But as I step back and think about Comcast's culture, doing the right thing, caring about people, building something truly unique, so much of that started with my dad, but has actually been brought to life for decades now by you, Dave. So on behalf of thousands and thousands of employees, a huge thank you.\nAnd Steve, who's sitting right here, not going to speak today, we're going to start him next quarter, you have been often running from day 1 when you became COO just under a year ago. All of the changes you're hearing about and have seen in our pricing, packaging, customer experience and infusing AI across the connectivity businesses have been driven really by Steve and his energized team.\nWe're clearly at an inflection point in the industry and transformational moment in our company. And we now have a leadership team adding on to the great successes of the past that's leaning in to change and actionize all the plans you just heard about, and we're excited about the future.\nSo before we get to Q&A, Mike, back to you for one last word.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comcast Corp.\n\nThanks, Brian. I truly appreciate the confidence that you and the Board have in me, and I couldn't be more excited to become Co-CEO at such interesting times in our industries. I know that I, and I think I can speak for the next wave of leaders across the company, are very eager to meet these challenges. And we're very confident, I'm very confident, that we will drive value over the next several years on the back of the strength of our people, our business assets and the strategies that we already have in flight. And we'll make whatever adjustments need to be made, but couldn't feel more excited and more confident. So with that, I look forward to diving into your questions. And back to you, Marci.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nOperator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.",

I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I hand it to Jason, I want to talk about three things that are particularly significant this quarter related to several of the strategic priorities of the company. First is our broadband business, where we continue to roll out our new go-to-market strategy in a highly competitive environment. Second is our theme parks, where we successfully opened Epic Universe in Orlando, one of the largest and most ambitious projects in our history.\nAnd third is our media segment, where our extraordinary mix of live events, sports, and entertainment across NBC and Peacock led to a record-breaking upfront as we continue to execute on our strategy of running NBCUniversal's linear and streaming assets as one holistic media business. Let me start with broadband. We've taken a hard look at what it takes to compete and win, and we start with great confidence that our products and network are marketplace leaders.\nThat includes our AI-powered entertainment OS, the most intelligent Wi-Fi network in the country, and a mobile service delivering the fastest speeds in our footprint. We're proud that we've re-energized a culture that drives innovation, one that continues to set our products and services apart. Building on that foundation, we took several important steps this quarter to strengthen our position.\nOur goal for all the actions we've taken is to build a loyal customer base that churns less and values our services more by, one, delivering simple, predictable, and transparent pricing, and, two, making it easier than ever to do business with us. Specifically, we've realigned our pricing strategy around seven main elements. First, we've moved from local offers to a consistent national pricing structure. Second, we simplified our broadband offering with four flagship speed tiers. Third, everything is included.\nAll packages come with unlimited data and our advanced gateways, which deliver the fastest, most reliable Wi-Fi experience, enable the connection of hundreds of devices, provide low-lag internet for gaming and streaming, and feature advanced Wi-Fi controls and cybersecurity protection. Fourth, we've lowered everyday pricing. Fifth, we introduced both one-year and five-year price guarantees without contracts to give customers more choice and certainty.\nSixth, we're including a free Xfinity Mobile line for one year for all new and existing customers. And finally, we introduced our premium unlimited mobile plan, which includes 4K Ultra HD streaming, expanded mobile hotspot usage, and device upgrades. But in addition to pricing changes, we focused on making it easier to do business with us. We are incredibly focused on reducing friction across all of our channels (dot com, phone, chat, and our app) and making every customer interaction an excellent and personalized experience.\nFor instance, we recently improved our digital buy flow by removing five steps, making the purchase process faster and easier, which has already driven more than a 20% improvement in purchase conversion rates. We also recently upgraded the operating system that manages our customer interactions to Google's AI platform, which will significantly improve our digital experience and route customers quickly to the support they need, providing our teams with full visibility into each customer interaction.\nTogether, these changes we are making in pricing transparency and ease of doing business are starting to drive the results and customer behavior we are aiming for. Customers are responding to the simplicity and power of these changes, with roughly half of our eligible new customer connects choosing our five-year price guarantee this quarter. We also posted a 20% increase in the percentage of new customers taking Gig Plus speeds, which lifted our overall speed tier mix and helped drive higher connect ARPU.\nWe're also seeing stabilization in voluntary churn and overall connect activity in broadband. Momentum is building in wireless as well. Our free line offer and solid uptake in our new premium unlimited plans helped drive our best quarter ever with 378,000 new lines added, bringing Xfinity Mobile to 14% penetration of our residential broadband base and still leaving us with plenty of room to run. Before we leave broadband, I want to highlight a recent deal on the Comcast Business side that strengthens our go-to-market approach for that customer base.\nJust last week, we announced a new MVNO agreement with T-Mobile in partnership with Charter. This new agreement pairs our industry-leading broadband and Wi-Fi with T-Mobile's 5G network to expand our mobile product offer to business customers as a fully integrated solution. We are pleased to work with T-Mobile in this initiative and continue to value our strong partnership with Verizon. So the net of this is, while it's still early days, we like what we are seeing in our broadband business, giving us confidence in the changes we've made and what's still ahead.\nWe're executing on a connectivity strategy that fully plays to our strengths in broadband, Wi-Fi, and convergence, leveraging the largest gig speed broadband and mobile converged footprint in the country that serves both residential and business customer segments and a best-in-class in-home experience through our advanced Xfinity Wi-Fi Gateway. With our go-to-market strategy in place and execution improving, we're well-positioned to lead in convergence. Turning to parks, we are extremely proud of the successful opening of Epic Universe in May.\nWe're pleased with the early results as Epic is already driving higher per-cap spending and attendance across the entirety of Universal Orlando Resort, with strong food and merchandise sales and minimal impact on attendance at Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure. Epic is the most technologically advanced park we've ever built, and we are getting high praise for the innovative attractions, immersive environments, three new on-site hotels, and our strong food and merchandise offering.\nAs expected, our near-term focus is on expanding ride throughput to reduce early attendance constraints. Epic is trending in line with our expectations and well on its way to transforming Universal Orlando into a true week-long destination. Beyond Orlando, we're executing against a strong pipeline of new opportunities to serve more guests. Universal Horror Unleashed opens in Las Vegas next month, and we're developing a second year-round horror experience in Chicago, tapping into one of the country's top tourist markets.\nIn addition, in Texas, our Universal Kids Resort is moving towards a 2026 opening, and we're continuing the planning process for our new park outside of London slated to open in 2031. These projects reflect our long-term strategy to expand reach, enter new markets, and broaden the appeal of our park's portfolio. Turning to media, our world-class combination of entertainment content, live sports, and events continues to drive results across NBC and Peacock.\nWe just closed our most successful Upfront ever with record total sales and our largest sports commitments to date. Peacock was a standout of more than 20% year-over-year and representing over 1/3 of NBCUniversal's total volume. Our upfront results reflect our unparalleled 2026 lineup of tentpole events, starting with the Milano-Cortina Olympics, Super Bowl 60, and the NBA All-Star Game in February, the FIFA World Cup on Telemundo in June, and the elections and BravoCon in November, along with a robust slate of entertainment and sports content throughout the year.\nWe also expect to build on the momentum we are seeing in our entertainment content. Love Island USA, which appeared exclusively on Peacock, was the top streaming reality series for the entirety of its season seven run. It attracted a significant number of first-time subscribers, and importantly, 2/3 of those new paying customers went on to engage with additional content, driving a lift in overall consumption across the platform.\nPeacock continues to differentiate itself with one of the most robust live sports offerings of any streamer, and that position will only strengthen with the addition of NBA coverage this fall. In fact, in 2026, Peacock will stream more live sports hours than any other streaming entertainment service. Add to that pay-one films from our top-performing studios, original series, next-day NBC and Bravo content, news, and a full entertainment library, and Peacock continues to deliver significant value.\nTo better reflect this premium content, we recently announced a $3 price increase rolling out in July for new subscribers and in late August for existing ones. The impact of this price increase, combined with the strong upfront results I just discussed, helped position us in the fourth quarter as we launch the NBA and take on higher sports program expenses, particularly in the first year of the NBA contract when we absorb the full impact of adding these new rights.\nSo to wrap up, across the company, we're executing with focus, simplifying how we operate, and leaning into areas where we have real competitive advantages. We're doing it while maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning meaningful capital to shareholders. We feel great about the momentum we're building and confident in our ability to create long-term value. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a high-level overview of our consolidated results before getting into more detail on our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 2%, benefiting from our core six growth drivers, three of which are organized under connectivity, including broadband, wireless, and business services, and three of which are in content and experiences, including parks, streaming, and studios. Collectively, these businesses represent nearly 60% of our total revenue and grew at a high single-digit rate this quarter.\nAs you fast forward a couple of years between continued investment in sustaining strong growth in these businesses and actions we are taking on other areas, including our announced spinoff of our linear cable networks into Versant and a recently announced sale of another one of our businesses, our exposure to these growth areas will be closer to 70% of our total revenue, which is fundamental to our path to re-accelerating total company revenue growth. EBITDA grew 1% this quarter.\nAdjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.25, and we generated 4.5 billion of free cash flow while returning 2.9 billion to shareholders, including 1.7 billion in share repurchases. Now turning to our businesses, starting with connectivity and platforms. Beginning with broadband, the competitive environment remains intense as we had previewed, and when combined with the typical negative seasonality in the second quarter, it resulted in 226,000 subscriber losses.\nBut as Mike described, we are encouraged by the early reaction to our new go-to-market initiatives as we started to see some early signs of stabilization in both connect activity and voluntary churn. Notably, during the quarter, we saw roughly half of our eligible new customer connects select our five-year price guarantee, opting to pay more upfront for longer-term consistency. In addition, we've seen a 20% increase in the share of new connects choosing our premium Gig Plus speeds.\nThis contributed to broadband ARPU growth in the quarter of 3.5%. Looking ahead, we continue to expect healthy broadband ARPU growth over the balance of the year, although the rollout of our new everyday pricing structure at the end of the second quarter is expected to moderate ARPU growth in the near term as we begin transitioning customers to more consistent and predictable pricing. This includes the continued offer of a free wireless line for a year to both new and existing broadband customers.\nConvergence revenue sustained healthy growth as well, up 3.7% in the quarter, supported by high teens growth in wireless revenue. Fueled by the strength of our Xfinity Mobile product and compelling go-to-market initiatives, including our promotion offering a free mobile line and our recently introduced premium unlimited plan, we accelerated net line additions to 378,000 in the quarter, a new high-water mark for wireless net additions for our company.\nOur wireless lines have now reached 8.5 million and penetration of 14% of our residential broadband customer base, a rate that demonstrates both our success in entrenching our product as a competitive offering in the wireless industry, but also that highlights the tremendous runway we have ahead. So we're pleased with the results in the quarter and expect continued acceleration in the pace of net additions in the coming quarters. Turning to business services, revenue increased 6% and EBITDA grew nearly 5%.\nOur results this quarter include the acquisition of Nitel, which closed in early April. Nitel contributed a few hundred basis points to revenue growth and about 100 basis points to EBITDA growth, and we expect a similar positive impact for the next few quarters until we anniversary this deal next year. Our strong performance continues to reflect the same framework we've seen for the last several quarters, including solid growth in SMB and even stronger growth at our enterprise solutions business.\nAt SMB, despite increased competitive intensity, we continue to generate healthy revenue growth by driving higher adoption of our suite of advanced services, including cybersecurity and Comcast Business Mobile. In our enterprise solutions business, we continue to see strong momentum. This growing segment of our customer base has more complex needs ranging from cybersecurity to multi-location connectivity, and they value integrated solutions and service reliability. These are areas where we continue to invest and lead.\nConnectivity remains the core of our business, and we continue to see a meaningful shift in advanced solutions. Three years ago, for every $1 of connectivity sold, we sold $0.20 of advanced solutions. Today, that figure has grown to approximately $0.50, underscoring the increasing value we're delivering to customers and reinforcing our competitive position. Putting all of this together, EBITDA was flat in the quarter, consistent with comments we made last quarter that our new go-to-market strategy would impact our ability to grow EBITDA this year.\nWe still believe that to be true as our investment in our operational pivot will ramp over the remaining quarters of 2025. On the other side of this, these actions will position us well for long-term convergence revenue growth with a more durable customer base on market-based rate plans with long-term price stability, and a discounted wireless offering with broader exposure across our base, giving us a large revenue and profit pool to unlock over time. In content and experiences, there are several key items I'd like to highlight.\nAt Parks, revenue increased 19% this quarter, driven by the successful opening of Epic Universe on 22 May, while EBITDA growth was limited to 4% due to soft opening costs at the new park. As Mike mentioned, we're really happy with the consumer response, and we're pleased with how Epic is contributing to the overall Universal Orlando guest experience and performance. We expect Epic to continue to scale over the course of the year with higher attendance and per caps, as well as significantly improved operating leverage.\nMore broadly, performance at our international parks remains strong. However, we do continue to experience pressure in Hollywood, and we think it will be a couple more quarters until we lap that. Turning to studios, we saw strong performance from the successful theatrical launch of How to Train Your Dragon on 13 June, which has grossed over $600 million in worldwide box office year to date, driving this franchise past the $2 billion mark.\nThis success was followed by the 2 July opening of Jurassic World: Rebirth, which is the seventh installment of our $6 billion franchise and has already surpassed $700 million in worldwide box office this month. While the benefit of Jurassic's theatrical performance will land in Q3, the investment to launch two of our three tentpole releases back to back impacted our Q2 results and profitability.\nIn addition to Jurassic, we look forward to several more releases in Q3, including The Bad Guys 2, Nobody 2, Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, Him, and Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie. In media, total advertising revenue was down 7%, in part due to the volume and timing of sports content, as well as tough political comparisons. Excluding this, advertising was down low single digits. As a reminder, for us, Q2 has historically lacked tentpole sports, so we've been more susceptible to fluctuations in general entertainment ratings. We look forward to that changing next year with the launch of the NBA.\nLooking ahead to Q3, we will have a tough comparison to the very successful Paris Olympics, but feel well-positioned over the next year given our strong lineup of content, including the NBA premiering in Q4 and the Winter Olympics, and Super Bowl in Q1 2026, all of which contributed to record Upfront results that Mike highlighted earlier. Our overall media results this quarter were driven by the continued meaningful progress we are making in our pivot to streaming.\nPeacock delivered double-digit revenue growth and a nearly $250 million year-over-year improvement in EBITDA losses, which landed $100 million this quarter. Despite Q2 being a seasonally light sports quarter, we held paid subscribers steady at 41 million, driven in part by the wildly popular new season of Love Island USA. Before wrapping up on capital allocation, let me start by spending a minute on the impact of the corporate tax provisions in the recently enacted tax legislation.\nThe legislation restores 100% bonus depreciation, reinstating full expensing for property acquired and placed in service after 19 January of this year, and restores immediate deductibility for domestic R&D expenses. So how does this impact us? We are a leader in US infrastructure investment. We're a leader in domestic content production, and we're a leader in the domestic experiences category. In fact, we have the nation's largest broadband network and are extending our network by adding 1.2 million passings a year.\nWe've just debuted the largest and most sophisticated theme park built in the US in decades. We are leaders in entertainment programming and production with our film studio consistently ranked number one or number two in worldwide box office, and we are number two in domestic sports programming and the home to many of the top sports in the US, like the NFL, the Olympics, the World Cup, golf, and we'll soon add the NBA.\nAs a result of all of that, there are several things in the legislation that benefit us, and we estimate on average roughly $1 billion in annual cash tax benefit for the next several years, with much of the benefit relating to infrastructure investments.\nIn broadband, we've said for some time now that we expect in the vast majority of our domestic footprint, there will effectively be two multi-gig symmetrical wires running into the home, and that's exactly what we've been preparing for by further strengthening and extending our network and innovating to differentiate the in-home Wi-Fi experience we deliver. The change in tax legislation provides a tailwind to that strategy and further supports our US investment, benefiting the company, our customers, and the communities we serve all across the country.\nSo our expectation is that this legislation helps fuel the capital allocation formula that's been successful for us, which starts with reinvesting in our businesses, prioritizing a strong balance sheet, and strong returns of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We've been shrinking our share count by mid-single digits on an annual basis for the past several years, and we expect to continue to do that as part of a robust and balanced capital allocation framework. With that, let me turn it back over to Marci.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star and the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star and the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, please press star to the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question today is coming from Michael Rollins from Citibank. Your line is now live.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nCommunications Services and Infrastructure Analyst, Citibank\n\nThanks and good morning. First, on broadband, you mentioned the early reaction that you've seen from the adjustments to your go-to-market. Curious if you'd give some more details on that, on the competitive landscape, and how that influences the pace over which you'd expect to improve quarterly broadband performance going forward.\n\nDave Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nHey, Mike, this is Dave. So starting with the competitive landscape, it remains intense, as we've noted. Fixed wireless remains very active in the marketplace. Fiber competitors continue to build more passings. So that certainly hasn't changed in terms of the landscape. From our perspective, we want to make these changes that will help our competitive position, leverage our strengths, but change the experience side of things to address some of the pain points that we've talked about.\nSo while it remains intense, the changes—what doesn't change is our tremendous sense of urgency around getting to the other side, around whether it's all-in pricing, whether with leveraging the gateway included unlimited, the free mobile line as part of it, the lowering everyday pricing, the five-year price guarantee that's key, and all the customer experience changes. Those things are underway. Really early to comment in terms of any impact at this point, other than to say, as Jason brought up, that the early connect activity is very encouraging.\nHalf of the eligible new customer connects selected the five-year price guarantee, and we saw a 20% increase in the share of new connects choosing the premium gig speed. So like the early results, but we're moving with a lot of speed and like the early results.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nMike, it's Mike. I'll just jump in and echo and kudos to Dave and Steve and team. The urgency with which they're going after the competitive environment is really strong and impressive. So thanks to that team for that. But I think to answer your question as well, all the tools of the go-to-market changes that I went through, the seven of them, plus the various attacks on any element of customer friction in the experience of engaging with us, whether that's through VRUs, dot-com channels, sales channels, or otherwise, there's a lot going on. And I think all that is in the market.\nSo as we engage with customers, whether they're at a promo roll moment or a new customer coming in the door or just a normal customer interaction, I think there's a lot of, all the things we talked about are at work, and I think it's a mode of continuous improvement throughout the business.\nWhen new things pop up, we're going to be doing new things to address the competitive situation with a view that obviously this is a hugely important business, and I think the goal of it all is to position the broadband customer base or really the connectivity customer base in a way that we've got a very loyal, satisfied, value experiencing the value of our products with greater stickiness, lower churn, and exposed to our mobile product, which we think drives a lot of value.\nAnd I think that's going to set us up well for the long-term competitive dynamic that Jason described just a moment ago of having two lines into each home in the marketplace over the long term. So I think bringing great products, great service, and a great network to bear on all that, wrapped in all the things that Dave and Steve are doing, is the plan of attack.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nCommunications Services and Infrastructure Analyst, Citibank\n\nThanks.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, thank you. Let me stay with broadband if I could. Charter called out involuntary disconnects, those non-pay disconnects, as one of the headwinds. I wonder if you're seeing any of the same thing, which I suspect would point to some continuation of the market impact of discontinuing the ACP program.\nAnd then if I think about Project Genesis and where you are with your network upgrades, have you seen any material differences in the way you're competing in Project Genesis markets where you're finished versus where you're not finished yet? What kind of market impact is that having?\n\nDave Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nHey, Craig, this is Dave. So non-pay, from our perspective, we've seen a slight uptick at this point, balanced by, as Jason and Mike said, that both in going into Q2 relative to Q1 on connects and voluntary churn, we saw stabilization. There was a slight uptick in non-pay, but not material. So on Genesis, the great part, as Mike talked about the network, you have to put in perspective. We have invested pretty consistently over a long period of time, mid-splits and other things that put us in a great position. I mean, today, we have gig-plus speeds everywhere.\nOur ability to compete for all segments, we're in a really good position to do that. And so in terms of the upgrades, we're on track. We're ahead of plan, actually. And we are motoring very quickly on the next phase, which is going to the DOCSIS 4.0. So we're in good shape. We're competing with the strength of the network. And one addition I would add to our network, when we talk about our network, a huge part of our point of differentiation is Wi-Fi. That you have to include Wi-Fi in it. And our definition of great Wi-Fi is the Wi-Fi that matches the capability of your network.\nSo great coverage, great speeds, and intelligence that can manage just lots of devices. So overall, when you step back, I think our network position is very strong.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nAnd Craig?\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nCould I squeeze in one more if I could?\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThank you for your next question, please.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Mikael Lang from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nMikael Lang\n\nManaging Director of Engineering, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just have two on broadband. First, on pricing, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about this concept of everyday pricing as a potential drag to ARPU growth. How many of your broadband customers are on pricing that are above those headline everyday price rates today? Just trying to understand how long these ARPU headwinds may persist. And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk about whether we're back to seasonal on domestic broadband net adds.\nCould we see improving net additions next quarter, just given back to school? Thank you.\n\nDave Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nHey, Mikael. So in terms of everyday pricing, our focus is to get rolling in the early stage part of this. In terms of impact, it's connects. We've talked about the connect early stage results. That's pretty encouraging. Half of the eligible customers are taking it. We won't be bashful in terms of making available to the existing base the right packages that make sense for them.\nWe won't give detail in terms of the level of customers at this point, but we're going to be very disciplined with a lot of purpose around making sure whether it's base management or in retention, that all of our packages will be made available to them. We'll be pretty aggressive. I think we like when we put people into, as Mike said, the more we put into these longer-term packages. Again, if they are willing to pay a little bit more upfront and to have that stability, that's good news for us. And to have all the capability of the products and with an eye towards churn improvement.\nSo it's going to be an aggressive broad-based plan: connects, base management, and retention, and full use of these new go-to-market tactics. On the seasonal trends, I think there's been a steady movement towards more seasonal activity that we have seen over time. So yes, this is a Q3, is always a pretty big back-to-school period, and we are, as always, aggressively positioned to go after that. There are seasonal trends that just happened in Q2 that we talked about, but I think there's movements towards more predictable seasonal trends that we had previously seen.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nYeah. Hey, Mikael, it's Jason just to round out the ARPU question. So as we said in the upfront remarks, 3.5% growth this quarter. We expect it to moderate in the next couple of quarters as we migrate more customers onto new pricing, with the goal being it takes several quarters to do this. But if you fast forward a year or two years out, we've got a substantial portion of our base migrated onto new packaging. We gave a guide that said we still expected healthy ARPU growth in this timeframe, but moderated a little bit from where we are right now.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Jason, you called out 3.7%, I think, convergence revenue growth, which is a nice way to kind of cut through all the GAAP allocations. When you look at the business in the back half, should we expect any movement up or down in that when you sort of think about the volume improvements in mobile offset by your ARPU commentary? And I was also curious if you had a cash tax number or help for 2025. Given all the changes, that would be helpful. And then for Mike, just on Peacock, you got a lot going on in that business.\nYou're going to have a lot of revenue coming in with that price increase and the upfront, but also the NBA. Just, can you talk a little bit about how you see the rest of the year playing out for that business, just as we think about all those moving pieces? Thanks a lot.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nSeveral questions there, Ben. Let me start with cash taxes. So we set $1 billion a year on average for the next several years as a result of substantial domestic infrastructure investments we make. We're exactly the type of company that benefits because of the type of investments we're making. I'd look for that to be roughly that number in 2025. Not something we're going to kind of continue to guide on, but as you look to set expectations for 2025, that's probably about the right number. On convergence revenue, maybe I'll tag team with Dave a little bit.\nBut as you look at this quarter, 3.7% growth, I think what we're setting ourselves up for, again, if you fast forward, is a base that's repackaged on the broadband side and then a base of wireless business that's larger than it otherwise would be because we've exposed our product to more and more customers and have the ability to grow off of this when customers roll off the free line.\nThese are customers a lot of whom we necessarily wouldn't have attracted under legacy pricing and packaging, and now we have the opportunity to attract, expose them to our product, and then price them in a year from now when we roll off. So real opportunity there. In the interim, I think you're going to see a little bit of pressure on the convergence revenue metric.\nAs we said, ARPU comes under. ARPU growth moderates a little bit in the next couple of quarters. And wireless, we've got a portion of our base that's coming in on freeline, which moderates that metric as well, but all in the process of setting ourselves up for the one-year, two-year mark where we can reaccelerate.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nThis is Brian. I just want to, on the cash tax point, use it as an opportunity to say that any policy that encourages American investment really lines up extremely well with everything we've done since the founding of the company. So for decades, we've been investing mostly here in America, building the biggest broadband network, opening theme parks, high-skilled workforce.\nAnd we believe where technology's headed, especially with AI and all the different connectivity uses to reshape our society and everything we do, that we are in a great position to continue to lead and invest in the nation's broadband fiber internet infrastructure as we always have done. So I think it leads to the cash tax question that we are going to be able to take advantage of that policy in a way that's great for our customers.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nOkay thanks. Ben, it's Mike. So we do have a lot going on in Peacock and NBC. So let me just step back and kind of cover some ground here. So really happy with what the team has been doing. When you take NBC, and needless to say, we'll get to Parks at some point, but really great things going on in the Parks business.\nThe studio business has been a top-of-the-class performer. So alongside that is really our media businesses, where obviously there's a lot of challenges in the ecosystem. But we took on the challenge and opportunity of creating a streaming service in Peacock. And I'm proud to say that we see very strong continued momentum there. Q2, we saw revenues again up nicely into the double digits, 18%. As Jason mentioned, a $250 million year-over-year improvement in EBITDA to a loss of $100 million.\nBut it's really, when you look ahead now, a couple of quarters down the road, after the Versant spin, we'll then have a media business made up of NBC, Broadcast, Bravo, Telemundo, as well as Peacock that really are completely symbiotic, leveraging the strengths of the entertainment business, which is both scripted and reality entertainment, as well as sports and news. In addition, obviously, our pay-one movies.\nSo that new NBC media segment, I think, is really strategically well-positioned to continue to compete on the back of we're going to have our 100th anniversary of NBC next year. It's a business that's been around a long, long time, has an unbelievable amount of advantages. So having a strategy for the future that is going to serve customers in a digital way through Peacock, that wasn't the case a mere four or five years ago, I'm really glad we've got the business set up the way it's set up.\nSo when you look now ahead to what's coming from the moment where we're now launching into bringing the NBA back to NBC, which everyone here is extremely excited about, and I think the people at the NBA as well, because lots of great ideas for that. But that'll start in the fall and go obviously heavily into the first half of next year. It'll be the positives, needless to say, are it's going to give us a full year of sports programming. So the point Jason made earlier about the dearth of sports in our second quarter won't be the case next year.\nAnd obviously, it's a sport that is hugely culturally relevant. So there's lots of thinking going on in our entertainment side of how to build things beyond sports around the new audience. So we've talked about all the reasons we like the NBA so much before, but it's a big investment. So in this first season, we'll take a full year's worth of cost amortization related to the business, and that largely starts in the first quarter.\nI'll make a note that we'll do our accounting for that, where we are going to be essentially straightlining the 11-year contract, whereas our cash costs are substantially lower in the early years. So we'll have a big working capital benefit that I'll be calling out in the first couple of years of the contract. But put that to the side. On the revenue side, that's the cost. On the revenue side, obviously, we're taking a big price increase that was in effect already for new Peacock subscribers and will be in effect for existing at the end of August. So that's one element.\nI talked in the earlier remarks about the incredibly strong sports upfront. So I think a big piece of that is having the NBA in there. So that's delivered strongly. Over time, we'll have in the next few years, we'll have the opportunity to drive Peacock subscribers higher as we leverage NBA and other content, and the continuation of consumer trends moving from the linear ecosystem to the streaming ecosystem continues. We'll have our various distribution deals over several years, call it three or so, reset and capture more revenues on that side.\nOver multiple years, we'll have the chance to rebalance various programming commitments for Peacock and NBC at large. So that's the dynamics. I won't give you any particular second-half forecast, but as you look through the next year, we're onboarding all of that. I look forward to when we're here a year from now with one season under our belt and lapping that year. I think the business of media at NBC is set up to be well-positioned for growth from there, post-Versant, post-NBA, and with the scale of Peacock that it now is.\nAnd I think the last point is it's also a set of properties and assets that is going to be extremely attractive to the consumer and very well-designed to participate in any of the possible rebundlings and reaggregation of streaming services. So I think the team has accomplished a whole lot in these media businesses over the last few years. So proud of the work that everybody at NBC has done.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jessica Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Her line is now live.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director and Senior Media and Entertainment Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you. I guess it's time to get to Parks. Could you maybe give us some more color on what you're seeing in the market dynamics in Orlando, whether it's overall market growth? You mentioned that you're not seeing that much cannibalization in your own parks. And maybe kind of ultimate operating leverage and how you see CapEx flowing through. You have great IP, but ultimately, you'll have more. And then maybe just stepping back, kind of a broader question for Brian.\nAs you look out over the next couple of years, there's been so much going on in all of your businesses. What do you view as the most underappreciated growth levers for Comcast as a whole? And then, sorry, but Mike, a follow-up. You mentioned NBA, the cost kick-in Q1. Why not Q4 of 2025?\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nOkay. It's Mike, so thanks. I misspoke. It does kick in as the season starts, so it kicks in in the fourth quarter, goes through the full season. So sorry for that. In terms of Orlando, I think between ourselves and the other Parks business that's there, it's a very strong destination for consumers coming to market. With both businesses investing heavily, I think that's going to continue to be the case to the benefit of everyone in the market. What we're focused on, obviously, is Epic, which is new to market.\nAs I said in the prepared remarks, we're really pleased with what we're seeing in terms of revenues in Orlando year over year coming in across when you look at the Parks altogether, much higher per caps. That's driven by getting people there for the wonderful experience that is Epic. So I think as we look to the second half of the year, you'll see just in terms of operating leverage, I think things are on track with Epic and Orlando for us.\nAnd operating leverage will be improved simply due to the roll-off of sort of the soft opening that we kind of lapped versus the first quarter, which was a short period of Epic being fully open. So that's Orlando. Jessica, thanks. I think an important question and a kind of lens that I think is important to look a little longer. I think a bunch of things that are energizing for why perhaps we're underappreciated in terms of growth possibilities. Previously, we've articulated six growth businesses. So I won't re-articulate all of them.\nA lot of that's around broadband, both residential and business services. And I think we've re-energized the culture around here to focus on how to deliver innovation. We're pivoting. Our products are exciting. The pivot with wireless being a really leading part of the bundle for all customers and being more transparent and customer-focused. That's a great mandate. And the way we tell that story to the consumer with some of the team that we're assembling, I think you're going to see that really resonate.\nI'm very excited at the work that's being done. As I look a little bit also with the Versant spin, and you'll have a chance to hear from Mark Lazarus, Anand Kini, over time about that before the end of the year, it really does do a great thing for the growth businesses, those six businesses that today are about. They were 50%, now they're up to 60%.\nPost the spin, they become 65% of our revenues. And just a couple of years after that, if the trends continue, it'll be 70%. So all of a sudden, it's a very different narrative where half your company is declining and half your company is growing to where 70% of your company is growing. And each of those businesses has a runway of growth that you're excited by. And so I think we're a unique company. A number of you were at Epic Universe. Not many companies on the planet could take the decade it took to build maybe the finest theme park in the world.\nAnd we're looking forward to doing that over time in the London area. We've got some smaller adventures that are opening this summer in Las Vegas. And we just announced Chicago. And with kids in Texas and horror, we've got films. We've got Peacock. So I see so much excitement in our company. I look forward to the day where the story is a little simpler. I think that that's happening organically with what we just talked about. So very bullish. I think the best is coming. So that's my thoughts.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question is coming from Kutgun Mara from Evercore ISI, who's on the line.\n\nKutgun Mara\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. I want to ask about M&A. There's been a fair amount of deal-making across your peers, particularly on the communications side. Comcast has a long history of M&A, though I realize it's a nuanced regulatory backdrop at the moment. So how should we think about your interest level for potential acquisitions beyond some of the tuck-ins that you continue to make on business services?\nAnd maybe relatedly, I know it's maybe too early to talk about the path ahead at Versant, but whatever you could share on its inorganic opportunities as well would be very helpful ahead of the expected spin later this year. Thank you.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nWell, before we get to M&A, this is Brian. Mike can cover this as well. But I really think something we did this quarter that Dave touched on is the teaming with T-Mobile and business services. Business services now is about 25% of our connectivity business. It's a $10 billion part of the company. We've been making smaller organic growth and acquisitions in M&A, as you've heard. We now connect more small businesses than anyone else in the country. And we see strong traction with larger enterprises.\nSo it was very important for us to be able to use mobile in our relationships in the mid-market to win more share. And the relationship with T-Mobile allows us to now do that in ways that we haven't been able to offer before. So it's strategic. And I think we'll be hopefully a great partnership. And we're all very excited to get started. We also have a really important relationship and a terrific relationship with Verizon, with our MVNO there. And along with that deal with T-Mobile, we feel good about the capital-light approach to wireless.\nThe foundation of wireless strategy is Dave was talking about was Wi-Fi. And today, we carry about 90% of all of our traffic is going over Wi-Fi. And I think when people hear that, they're kind of stunned. And Wi-Fi works better when you're close to a wire. And we can marry a network together better than anyone. And I think now our customers are going to benefit from two national and two great national 5G networks. So M&A, kick it over to you, Mike, but really excited with the progress we've been able to strategically make with smaller acquisitions and with innovative partnerships.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nYeah. So on M&A, I think these are comments that are consistent with what you've heard from us before. I mean, I think it starts with, obviously, it's our job to consider things, think about things, look at what could be coming around the corner, and with discipline evaluate anything that does come along. So not speaking other than in a general way about that, you could assume that the cadence of what we do is to give a lot of thought to what inorganically could be value-creating.\nBut I think we said before and continue to say that the bar is really high because I think, particularly when you look at the moment in time we are with a lot of transitions that are, I feel, being well executed in our businesses, that we have plenty of opportunity to create value by running what we have really well and making growth investments either directly in businesses or the tuck-in kind of acquisitions that give us capabilities in places like business services, as you've seen us do.\nSo I think that's what you can count on us for. And when it comes to the other side of the equation, just thinking about the portfolio and what fits for what we're doing and what might be a better allocation of capital for our shareholders, that's where Versant comes in. So Versant, to your question, I think everything's tracking really nicely to have Versant launch at the beginning of next year, end of this year, into next year. Great leadership team, lots of energy.\nThe work is well underway. I think they will hit the ground running. I won't steal their thunder on their strategies and the like, but they've been at it since the day we announced. As you recall, I made the changes to everyone's responsibilities. So effectively, we've had a team focused on the future of Versant and the present of Versant from that moment almost a year ago now. So I think that is also a change of the dynamics for a use of capital. They generate a lot of cash, but now they're going to have that cash to put into a future for those businesses.\nAnd obviously, for the remaining businesses, there'll be revenue growth accretion and more focus on, say, the remaining NBC that I described earlier. So I think that we sold a business in Germany that was part of Sky. So I think M&A is a two-sided equation. And I think we're doing a nice job thinking about the balance across the whole footprint of things that we could do inorganically.\nBut again, bar is super high because we want to operate and take advantage of our management energies applied against the big gears that we have to improve the businesses that we currently own and operate.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Kutgun. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you for fitting me in. Maybe first, a follow-up on Brian's comments on the business market for Dave. Looks like you guys are seeing some additional pressure on subs there. Can you talk about the competitive market you're seeing in that segment? And as it relates to the T-Mobile MVNO, you've got 14% penetration on the Resi side. Do you expect the penetration of mobile into the business segment to sort of follow a similar slope? And then for Jason, on the $1 billion in cash back savings, can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of CapEx trends?\nMaybe on the cable side, are there opportunities to deploy additional capital maybe for further footprint expansion? And then how should we think of the CapEx as it relates to the parks, especially with all the new projects you guys have laid out? Thanks.\n\nDave Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nSo this is Dave. Let me start with the business services follow-up. So there are a couple of huge categories for us within business services, as you know. On the competitive side that you mentioned, it's been this way the last several quarters. In SMB, we are the market share leader. There's increased competition. We see some, certainly, with fixed wireless. Fixed wireless at this point, not really affecting our high-end part of SMB. And so we're the core mid-market and certainly enterprise.\nThere's real value in the reliability, multi-product solutions that we have, and we have a balanced approach towards growing revenue and relationships across the board. So it's a little bit more competitive in the SMB side. Mid-market and enterprise, though, strong momentum. And as Mike mentioned, integration of Nitel is well underway and adding capabilities of aggregation in the US and further, the network aggregation, expanding sales channels, broadening of the product portfolio, in particular, advanced security. And then, as you mentioned, mobile.\nSo mobile, as Brian mentioned, the relationship, we've got a great one with Verizon on Resi. There's a really important one with T-Mobile in business. So it's early stage. Comes at a really good time for us to kickstart a higher gear for our business services team. And including mobile is a big part of how they compete. So more to come on that.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nHey, John, on the CapEx side related to any sort of cash tax relief that we've articulated, let me step back on infrastructure as a category. A few of you have asked sort of questions related to this, but we are building out 1.2 million homes per year. We've done that. We're on pace to do that this year. Did this last year. If you really step back, this is a validation of how we see ultimately the market for broadband, right? And we're in a competitive period right now. Not sure we expect that to change. Fiber will continue to be built out against us.\nFixed wireless is going to continue to have sort of a niche it carves out in the value-conscious world. When we build new homes, though, it is against a framework that the competition of the future will involve two wires coming into the vast majority of the territory that we serve, in addition to fixed wireless having carved out a more permanent niche in the market.\nDespite that, we feel very comfortable competing in that sort of environment. So as we look to invest, you look at the cash tax profile, the changes that sort of dictates in terms of return profiles around investment, I would tell you it strengthens the case on the infrastructure side. So I would look for us to continue to be very aggressive in building out new homes, very aggressive in infrastructure investments to support the Genesis investment around mid-splits, DOCSIS 4.0, and how quickly we upgrade the network.\nSo I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, any incremental cash will fit into our traditional framework, which is, number one, investing in our businesses. And on the infrastructure side, this new legislation is a tailwind to that. On the park side, I think, as we've articulated before, you've called it right in your research. We get a little bit of a break here post-Epic. So obviously, we had substantial investments going to Epic. That was a big new launch. We'll trail down off of that for, call it, a couple of years.\nWe still have, obviously, a lot of investment going on in parks, including the smaller parks we've talked about. That'll sort of fill a little bit of the void, but nonetheless, we'll trend down for a couple of years, and then we'll ramp back up as we approach the park in London. But I'd look for that to be in a couple of years from now.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available today starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties.\nIn addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nCo-CEO, Comcast\n\nGood morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before Jason gets into the details of our Q1 results, I would like to spend some time on three topics that are top of mind: convergence, Business Services, and theme parks. Let me lead into those by anchoring the discussion in the two overarching elements of the management team's approach to running the company.\nFirst is that we are focused on shifting our business mix toward growth by investing in six areas where we're extremely well positioned: residential broadband, wireless, Business Services, theme parks, streaming, and premium content in our studios. We are seeing the effects of this strategy build as time passes. In this quarter, these six businesses represented percent of total revenues, helping drive 2% EBITDA growth, 5% adjusted EPS growth, and $5.4 billion of free cash flow.\nAnd second is our proven commitment to our capital allocation strategy which balances robust, disciplined investment in these growth areas, the protection of one of the strongest balance sheets, if not the strongest balance sheet in the industry, and the return of substantial capital to shareholders.\nTogether, our steady shift in business mix to a diverse group of growth areas, combined with our strong balance sheet, allows for steady execution against our strategy, even as the level of uncertainty in consumer and capital markets has meaningfully increased in the past several months. While we don't see any noteworthy evidence of economic challenges for the year thus far, the odds have increased that challenges may be approaching, but we are well positioned to handle whatever lies ahead.\nNow let me hit the areas I'd like to comment on more deeply, starting with convergence, where, as we've consistently highlighted, we are structurally positioned to win. Today, we are the only operator offering Gig Internet and Gig wireless ubiquitously to 64 million homes and businesses across 39 states, giving us the largest converged footprint in the country. When you look at just the geographic markets we serve, our Gig capable converged footprint is more than double our competitors combined.\nAnd as we've discussed before, our network upgrade plans will ensure that our network leadership and product capability remain ahead of the competition. But the true measure of a customer's connectivity experience lies in its performance within their home and that is where we excel given our superior Wi-Fi.\nReliable connectivity throughout the home continues to be ranked as the most critical element influencing customer's choice of broadband service, and we lead the industry in delivering this experience. In fact, the latest fixed broadband report by Opensignal ranks us highest in reliability in our footprint, and we continue to make this Wi-Fi experience even better, an example being the recent launch of our most powerful gateway yet, the XB10, which enables industry-leading multi-gigabit symmetrical throughput and supports up to 300 connected devices with increased speeds and reduced latency.\nThe importance of Wi-Fi extends to our mobile service as well as 90% of all mobile data whether in or out of the home travels over Wi-Fi, giving us another clear advantage. We have the largest and fastest Wi-Fi network in the nation that delivers unique benefits to our customers with features like Wi-Fi PowerBoost, which automatically upgrades Xfinity Mobile devices to gigabit speed whenever customers are connected to one of our 23 million hotspots regardless of their subscribed Internet speed.\nThis feature helped us earn the distinction of being the fastest mobile provider, according to Ookla's January 2025 speed intelligence report. However, and this is a big however, in this intensely competitive environment we are not winning in the marketplace in a way that is commensurate with the strength of the network and connectivity products that I just described.\nDave and his team have worked hard to understand the reasons for this disconnect and have identified two primary causes. One is price transparency and predictability, and the other is the level of ease of doing business with us. The good news is that both are fixable and we are already underway with execution plans to address these challenges.\nFirst are organizational changes. Steve Croney, who Dave appointed as Chief Operating Officer of Connectivity and Platforms, is driving the changes in our go-to-market strategy and other operational improvements with the highest urgency. One of his first priorities was to recruit a growth-focused leader, and we announced the hiring of Jon Gieselman to the newly created position of Chief Growth Officer of our domestic residential business, with decades of experience at Apple, Expedia, and DIRECTV managing world-class brands in highly competitive markets.\nJon is a fantastic addition to the team, and we're excited for him to join later this month. Second, we are simplifying our pricing construct to make our price-to-value proposition clearer to consumers across all broadband segments. Just last week, we introduced our first-ever nationwide price guarantee for broadband that includes Xfinity's best-in-class gateway and unlimited data for one simple monthly price that is locked in for five years, with no annual contract required.\nCustomers who sign up for this plan also have the option to add a free mobile line for one year, and we are not done. Providing more value to our customers with less complexity and friction is a top priority, and you will see our go-to-market approach continue to evolve over the coming months.\nThird, we are driving growth in Xfinity Mobile. The benefits are clear as we see an 80% improvement in customer lifetime value when we add wireless service to our broadband only customer relationships. We started prioritizing mobile attachment towards the end of the Q1, offering one unlimited line free for 12 months for all new and existing broadband customers who take our traditional and premium level products.\nThis resulted in the best quarter of new wireless net additions in two years, bringing our total wireless lines to 8.1 million. Last week we introduced our first ever premium unlimited wireless plan delivering gigabit speeds with 4K ultra-high definition streaming, more Wi-Fi hotspot data, advanced spam call protection, and a guaranteed device upgrade.\nWith mobile penetration at only 13% of our residential broadband customer base, we have plenty of runway ahead to leverage wireless as a key component of our connectivity bundle with our industry-leading broadband product. While we are glad to be underway with a refreshed approach to the market, we anticipate that it will take several quarters for a new approach to gain traction and impact the business in a meaningful way.\nMy second topic is Business Services, which has tremendous momentum and now accounts for almost 25% of the revenues of our entire connectivity business. We built Business Services, which is now approaching a $10 billion revenue generator from the ground up and have consistently outperformed peers with mid single digit revenue and EBITDA growth, and with margins in the high 50% range. Within the small and medium-sized business segment, we are the market leader and have done a phenomenal job at deepening customer relationships.\nWe've consistently grown ARPU in the mid single digits for the last few years with over half our small business relationships purchasing more than two products. We remain excited about the opportunity to continue advanced product sell in, including our Cyber Security Services and Comcast Business Mobile.\nWithin the Enterprise Solutions segment, we are capitalizing on the significant opportunity to increase our market share and grow customer relationships. We've consistently grown sales and revenue in this segment in the high single digits. Today our largest enterprise customers purchase over seven products from us. Connectivity is always going to be the core driver of our business. However, three years ago for every dollar of connectivity we sold in the enterprise segment, we sold $0.20 of advanced solutions.\nToday, for every dollar of connectivity services we sell, we sell approximately $0.50 of advanced services, further solidifying our right to win in the market and providing more value to customers. We've done this through a mix of organic investment and material. The Masergy deal advanced our secure networking and global capabilities, and a Nitel acquisition, which closed on 1 April, builds upon this playbook. Providing enhanced network aggregation capabilities increases our channel presence and provides more robust enterprise solutions.\nMy third and final topic is theme parks, which have been on an incredible growth trajectory, having generated $3 billion of EBITDA in 2024, up from around $1 billion 10 years ago as a result of significant investment in the business along with the excellent execution by the team leading Universal Destinations and Experiences, and now we are just four weeks away from the 22 May grand opening of Epic Universe, our most ambitious and technologically advanced theme park to date.\nWith iconic IP from Harry Potter, DreamWorks, How to Train Your Dragon, Horror with Dark Universe, and Super Nintendo World, Epic Universe doubles the size of our park footprint in Orlando, transforming our collection of resorts into a week-long vacation destination.\nWe have seen strong demand since launching Epic ticket sales in Q4 2024, and the most recent reaction to early previews has been nothing short of phenomenal, with thousands of media stories, social posts, and fan reviews characterizing Epic as having groundbreaking creativity and taking immersive entertainment to a whole new level.\nBeyond Epic, we're continuing to grow our parks business across the United States, starting with Universal Horror Unleashed, our first permanent year-round horror entertainment experience opening in Las Vegas this August. In 2026 we will debut our first ever Universal Kids Resort in Frisco, Texas. Earlier this month we announced plans to build our first ever Universal theme park and resort in Europe, with construction starting in 2026 and grand opening scheduled for 2031. This park and resort will be located in Bedford, England, right outside London.\nThe United Kingdom is an incredibly attractive market with its large population, a strong tourism industry, favorable transportation infrastructure, and close proximity to the rest of Europe. Especially considering the announced expansion plans at nearby Luton Airport. All these factors make this location an ideal one for Universal theme park and resort expansion into the European market. Those are some of my thoughts to frame today's call, and I will now turn the call over to Jason to provide a detailed overview of our Q1 results.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nThanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me start with a high level overview of our consolidated results before getting into more detail on our businesses. Consolidated revenue was in line with last year's Q1. We've been clear and consistent that we're investing behind six major growth drivers and these six grew at a mid single digit rate and represented close to 60% of our total revenue in the quarter.\nEBITDA grew 2% this quarter, adjusted EPS grew 5% to $1.09, and we generated $5.4 billion of free cash flow and grew free cash flow per share by 26% while returning $3.2 billion to shareholders including $2 billion in share repurchases. Now turning to our businesses and starting with connectivity and platforms, I'd like to start with broadband where the competitive environment remains intense while we continue to see muted connect activity.\nWe also saw a slight uptick in churn off of record low levels. This contributed to the loss of 199,000 customers in the quarter while broadband ARPU grew 3.3% leading to growth in broadband revenue of 1.7%. As Mike mentioned, we feel great about our network position. Simply put, we compete really well against any technology out there.\nWe feel equally great about our position in the home where our Wi-Fi coverage and control is second to none and we're addressing current customer pain points and investing in go-to-market with a focus on pricing, transparency, and simplicity, a unified national approach, and more products translating into more value for our customers. This will require investment in the form of already launched long-term all-inclusive price guarantees and other actions we will take in the coming months.\nOver time this will help us mitigate customer churn from promotional roll offs and better insulate our customer base on convergence. We said we would lean into wireless and the repositioning of our offers during the Q1 were evident in our results. We accelerated wireless net line additions to 323,000 in the quarter, both an improvement year-over-year and sequentially, bringing our total wireless lines to 8.1 million. With penetration at just 13% of our residential broadband customer base, we have significant runway for growth and expect continued momentum in subscriber growth in the coming quarters.\nWireless plays a growing role in deepening customer relationships and reducing churn, and the structure of our wireless business, with a strong MVNO partnership, industry-leading offloading onto Wi-Fi, and an advantage in customer acquisition as we target our existing base, provides us solid profitability in wireless and the option to reinvest some of this profit as we lean in and accelerate the growth of our wireless customer base even more.\nAt Business Services, both revenue and EBITDA grew roughly 4%. We have a leadership position amongst our peers when it comes to growth in this segment, and our strong performance this quarter was again driven by the framework that we've been operating in for some time.\nWhile we're experiencing an elevated level of competition in SMB, we continue to generate healthy revenue growth by driving higher adoption of our suite of advanced services which deepens the relationship with our large base of customers. Our enterprise segment is an even stronger contributor to growth and one in which we are just scratching the surface. Earlier this month we closed on our acquisition of Nitel.\nThis is a great tuck in acquisition that strengthens our ability to deliver advanced reliable connectivity solutions, enhancing Comcast Business's competitiveness in the managed services space. Nitel's network aggregation capabilities and network as a service offerings broaden our ability to service our customers, and their indirect channel distribution strategy magnifies our mid-market and enterprise presence.\nOur results in the Q2 will include Nitel, which we expect will add a few hundred basis points of revenue growth to Business Services with a minimal impact on EBITDA growth in the near term. Putting all this together, overall connectivity and platforms revenue in the quarter remained consistent with the prior year as 4% growth in our connectivity businesses, including residential, broadband, and wireless, together with Business Services, was offset by revenue declines in video, advertising, and other.\nEBITDA grew 1.5% in the quarter while margins expanded by 80 basis points, reflecting the growth and continued benefit from our mix shift to our connectivity businesses as well as our ongoing focus on operating efficiency in content and experiences. There are several key items I would like to highlight at parks. We're really looking forward to Epic Universe.\nAll of the earlier reviews have been spectacular, and we're incredibly excited for the transformation Epic will bring to visitors in the Orlando market as we gear up for the 22 May 2025 opening. We incurred incremental costs which landed at about $100 million in Q1. This is in line with what we had previously communicated. Looking past these preopening costs, underlying results in the quarter indicated stable trends in Orlando, giving us confidence that we are entering the Epic launch from a position of strength.\nIn addition, performance at our international parks remains strong and within our expectations, but we are seeing softness in Hollywood due to the aftermath of the wildfires, and our proximity to these areas which impacted our results in Q1 and we expect the recovery at Universal Hollywood to be a gradual one.\nTurning to Studios. Results this quarter were driven by the strong carryover success of Wicked. After an impressive theatrical run, Wicked continued to deliver great results in premium window sales and became Peacock's most watched Pay-One movie. Looking ahead, we are excited to launch two of our three tentpole releases back to back in the coming months. First up is How to Train Your Dragon on 13 June, followed by Jurassic World Rebirth on 2 July.\nIn media, total advertising revenue was down 7%, mainly due to the volume and timing of sports content, along with tough political comparisons. Excluding this, advertising was relatively flat. While we have not yet seen any impacts from the current macroeconomic uncertainty, advertising is the category that has shown the most economic related cyclicality in our business historically.\nHowever, for the Upfront and for the balance of the year, we feel well positioned in the market as we capitalize on the NBA launching in the Q4, a healthy Peacock subscriber base, and a strong content offering across entertainment and news. Our overall media results this quarter were powered by the meaningful progress we are making in our pivot to streaming.\nPeacock delivered double digit revenue growth and a more than 400 million year-over-year improvement in EBITDA losses in part due to lower expenses compared to last year when we streamed the exclusive NFL Wild Card game, but also driven by the improved monetization of Peacock paid subscribers. We ended the quarter at 41 million paid subscribers with net additions in the quarter driven by the entitlements from the Charter bundle we introduced at the end of the quarter.\nWhen we launched Peacock in 2020, we anticipated that bundling would become an important piece of the streaming ecosystem, so we pursued a content strategy that would appeal to a broad audience. In addition to our Pay-One films coming from our studios, over 80,000 hours of entertainment content including originals and next day air content from NBC Broadcast and Bravo. A critical piece of that strategy is our focus on sports. Today we offer more premium sports than any other streaming service, including the NFL, the Olympics, Premier League, Kentucky Derby, Big Ten, and then starting this fall, we look forward to adding the NBA.\nSumming it all up. Our capital allocation priorities are centered on reinvesting around growth in six key categories and consistently returning significant capital to shareholders, including $13.1 billion returned over the past 12 months, and we're in an incredibly strong position to successfully execute on tough decisions we're making in the face of elevated competition in certain areas.\nWe've been clear on the benefits of a strong balance sheet, cash flow, and diversification, allowing us to invest consistently through various credit cycles, the pandemic, and, importantly, macroeconomic cycles where we are broadly insulated and positioned to play offense.\nOur results in the Q1 underscore the success and the consistency of our strategy. We generated $5.4 billion in free cash flow while investing $2.9 billion in capital back into our businesses. At the same time, we maintained a healthy balance sheet, ending the quarter with net leverage at 2.3 times while returning $3.2 billion to shareholders, including $2 billion in share repurchases. Marci, now over to you for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star, the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star, the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, please press star, the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question today is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. Two questions if I could. First, maybe thinking about the theme parks business a little bit, Mike, maybe could you just dig in a little bit more to what you're seeing now? We've seen some very significant drops in international travel to the United States, for example, and some anti-American sentiment even affecting travel patterns. I'm wondering if you can just share what you're seeing with respect to the theme parks and how you think that might impact the 2025 results even with Epic.\nAnd then for the broadband and wireless bundles that you're offering today, it's a question that everybody has been focused on on the wireless side. You guys are subsidizing handsets. If the price of handsets rises significantly with tariffs, would it be your anticipation that you would increase your subsidies accordingly or would you expect to pass those higher costs on to customers?\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nCo-CEO, Comcast\n\nHey Craig, so it's Mike. I'll start on parks and then hand it over to Dave. So on theme parks, you know, our Q1 results, you know, continued to be, you know, stable in Florida. You know, we had pre-opening expenses for Epic Universe, but excluding that, underlying trend stable in Orlando. And what we're seeing for advanced bookings, both ticket sales and hotel bookings are strong for the overall parks and for Epic.\nSo while I see the same headlines you're sort of seeing about airlines and the like, some of that might be outside the window of our booking windows, but what we're seeing continues to be tracking well. And to your point, some of that is definitely related to the excitement about Epic.\nWithout a doubt, where reviews and pre-opening buzz is very strong. Again, ticket sales and advance plans are a little ahead of our expectations. So we feel right now what we see is continued steadiness in the backdrop for parks. I think one thing that you have to, our domestic parks do draw a lot of folks from the US and a lot of folks from markets in the south, in the case of Florida, that are not necessarily hopping on planes to get there.\nSo there may be a delayed effect between what the airlines are starting to report on and what we see. But like I said, no real sign of that in our business. As we sit here now, and then in LA, it's all related to getting LA back to having the tourism industry broadly recovered after the wildfires.\nI think the whole market is continuing to see people staying away a little bit more than I think the leadership in LA, broadly, or US as a parks owner in that market would like it to be. That's domestic parks, and international trends for Japan and Beijing stable as well.\n\nDave Watson\n\nVice Chairman and CEO of Connectivity & Platforms, Comcast\n\nCorrect, Dave. So in wireless and how it's positioned within packaging bundling, let me start with, you know, we are a challenger. It's good to be a challenger in any environment, including this one in particular, as I think customers are looking for savings and we have a, I think we're in a great position and a really important part of our convergence and packaging approach.\nWireless is a huge piece of it and we just, you know, our new offers at the end of Q1 part of that are having one unlimited line free for 12 months and all new and existing broadband customers and you know, taking traditional premium level products. So it's resulted in a great quarter to start with. We're, you know, rolling here and we expect continued acceleration in coming quarters with it. So we're leveraging Wi-Fi.\nIt's a different experience with PowerBoost and many other things that Mike and Jason talked about. So when it comes to the overall marketplace, the other good part of wireless is source of business in that we're upgrading the overall base of customers broadband into wireless. Their wireless base itself, they're upgrading and we're a great choice for bringing your own device. And so that is an option for us and all throughout this, we want to be where the customer is, and that's where we're constantly focused on that. So when it comes to macroeconomic and other issues.\nWe have figured it out whether it's competitive intensity. We think we'll manage through it, and we have good offers on devices. We'll see how things go. But our core service offerings provide substantial value, and that is our focus and will continue to be that.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Craig. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is now live.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks, guys. Just one question from me. I'd love to get a sense in your Project Genesis markets to what extent you're seeing benefits in terms of stronger growth adds from the ability to offer faster speeds, lower churn, better ARPU, improved OpEx, et cetera.\n\nDave Watson\n\nVice Chairman and CEO of Connectivity & Platforms, Comcast\n\nWell, it's an important part of our upgrade initiative, and it's helped us, you know. I think a core piece of our strategy is constant innovation and upgrades to existing services. And so it has resulted in upstream speeds, downstream, you know, speed increases. And so that, that has been an important part of our positioning for near term and long term. It still, as we have a substantial part of our market that has already reached this point.\nOur main focus, as I zoom out just a bit more in terms of broadband, is really addressing the key pain points that both Mike and Jason talked about. That's where the focus is. The good news is, as you look at things in our network, Genesis being a big part of it, positions us quite well.\nBut broadband customers with us and more broadly across the industry are just doing more. And that's why we continue to invest in the service. It's for the long term. Bandwidth consumption continues to be robust. It was up 10% per subscriber last quarter. More devices are being connected per household, and every secular trend in that respect is positive. So that's a great starting point.\nHowever, the thing that we've seen and what we're trying to address, we believe there's been just a durable change in the competitive intensity, already intense, but continues to be. So we're really well positioned with our network Genesis, a piece of it, and our products, but the pain points in pricing, transparency, and the simplicity and ease of doing business with us, and that's what we're responding to.\nAnd maybe one of the main points is with the price lock, equipment inclusions all in pricing around that free mobile lines and some other things that we have coming. So that's our focus around and the reason why we're optimistic about where network consumption is going, but nothing specific at this moment in terms of any of the churn benefits related to just the Genesis. I think the pain points over time that we're addressing with the new go to market approach will be where the benefits will come from.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Mikael Lang from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nMikael Lang\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just have two as well. First, on broadband ARPU, it was encouraging to see the 3.3% growth in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers there. And then longer term, as you talk about these go to market changes, the five year price lock, could you just talk about your outlook for what for the 3% to 4% longer term domestic broadband ARPU growth. Like what's your commitment level there and how will some of the new pricing and packaging change this, if at all? Thank you.\n\nDave Watson\n\nVice Chairman and CEO of Connectivity & Platforms, Comcast\n\nHey Michael, this is Dave. So as I mentioned before, what we're trying to do really focus on the pain points in this market. And with the five-year price lock, mobile inclusion, and simplicity of packaging multiple products together, we can execute this tactically, surgically, and do not view it as a broad repricing of our base.\nWe think we can still drive healthy broadband ARPU growth, but these initiatives will require some investment which in turn will impact our ability to grow EBITDA in the near future. But we view the impact as very manageable. Most important to us is what sits on the other side and how quickly we can get there. And that is a customer base with less pricing friction, even more stickiness, and a huge lever in wireless.\nWith our mobile product exposed to a much larger segment of our base and the ability to migrate this space into a still below market rate that has a lot of upside potential. So we're using this as a moment to get away from a model that at least partially relied on deep discounting up front, but then increasingly results in untenable increases after promotional periods.\nAnd we'll have customers that have long term certainty on pricing over time that is competitive with market rates, which means they're more satisfied, churn at a lower rate, and carry much higher customer lifetime value. And with this, we'll have plenty of room to grow with our customers as they do more in our broadband network and engage more with us in wireless and other offerings. As a company, we've navigated plenty of changes before. This is the right change for our business in this moment and going forward. It's a change we can navigate in a very prudent way.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks Mike.\n\nMikael Lang\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dave.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nOperator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Michael Rollins from Citibank. Your line is now live.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citibank\n\nThanks and good morning. Two questions as well for me. So first on broadband, just curious if you could discuss how much of the recent losses may be a function of slower industry growth given the maturation of the category relative to changes in market share, and if you're seeing differences in performance where you're in markets that have had fiber for some time versus those markets where fiber is just getting introduced.\nAnd then second on the mobile side for the mobile gross adds, just curious if you're seeing a mix shift in terms of the percent that come from existing broadband customers versus new broadband customers and how you expect the new promotions to influence that. Thanks.\n\nDave Watson\n\nVice Chairman and CEO of Connectivity & Platforms, Comcast\n\nHey Michael, so let me start with broadband. I'll get to mobile. The competitive environment remains intense as we've talked about. You know, you got three national providers, Fixed Wireless; their net adds have stabilized, looks like, in general, but they're still marketing very aggressively. As you mentioned, fiber continues to overbuild. We're dealing with that overbuild.\nOverall, we continue to see the impact of this muted connect activity as Jason noted. We did see a slight uptick in churn this quarter compared to the record low levels over the last few years. Churn still below pre-pandemic levels. The churn increase was relatively broad-based, though, as we saw it across our footprint and in all segments of product mixes, but with a little more in mobile substitution impact this quarter.\nSo, as that thus resulting in our actions and the game plan that we have to address our competitiveness, simplifying our go-to-market approach, and leveraging mobile even more aggressively than we historically have done. We've had success, some success, with buy one get one. This new mobile offering and including in a package in a simple way that we have, I think, is just going to add a lot of value and provide long-term opportunities in a healthy, healthy way in terms of roll-offs of mobile after that first year. So, competitive issues are across the board in mobile. We've seen in terms of the mix a healthy.\nCustomer base upgrade mix where we have a large upside: the percent of our customers, broadband customers that don't have our mobile product yet. We see that as a huge opportunity over time. That has been our focus of upgrade, but we're also competing fiercely for new customers, and we're well positioned with Bring Your Own Device.\nThese new packages are, I think, going to be very appealing, most certainly with the one year included and not asking the customer. It's included as part of the package. So, you know, the other thing too, just to make sure everyone, reminding people, we just announced this, that we've rolled out a new set of premium plans in mobile. We're interested in every segment, and we'll compete for customers and broadband mobile packaging.\nBut the new premium mobile offerings we think will help us compete a little bit more effectively in the premium higher end as well. So really good news on that, really encouraged. It's only been a week or so since we've done it, but that would be, I think, a good option for our base. It would be a good option for existing mobile customers and will help us compete for new prospects.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Curious if you guys have any update for us on how to think about Peacock losses over the rest of this year? Obviously Q1 big improvement year-over-year. Some of that might be timing, but it would be helpful if you could give us a little bit of an outlook for that business over the rest of 2025, and then kind of sticking with this theme on the pivot in the cable business or connectivity business.\nJason, you mentioned the word investment a couple times, I think. Dave, you did too in one of your answers. We've sort of been accustomed to watching Comcast execute with sort of a priority or focus on ARPU growth, margin expansion. And obviously we've seen the subscriber numbers.\nCome in light over the last year or so. What would you tell us to think about at least over the next few quarters as you roll out these plans? It seems like you're already starting to see some wireless momentum, and maybe there's some EBITDA pressure. But I just thought give you an opportunity to maybe give us a little more help on how the rest of the year looks as you sort of pivot the model in the business. Thanks a lot.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nCo-CEO, Comcast\n\nHey, Ben, good morning, it's Mike. So I'll hit Peacock. I think Jason covered a bunch of this and you touched on it yourself. But I think looking at what Peacock is and what we've accomplished, continued strong revenue growth, so up 16% on revenues year-over-year. That's on the back of better monetization of subscribers. We took a price increase last year that stuck, but obviously translates into impact on subscriber growth. We've obviously taken in the charter subs. So overall we're scaling up the business and we're monetizing it well, and then so that drove the $400 million of EBITDA growth together with the move of or the absence of the NFL Wild Card Game.\nSo I think it shows the power of the team that's running Peacock, and all of us have been focused on it is to keep driving towards improved monetization and build a product that, you know, we started late, but we started in 2020 with the view that we'll pursue a content strategy that builds on the strengths of NBCUniversal broadly. So we've got 80,000 hours of entertainment including our Pay-One movies, Next Day, NBC, Peacock Originals, Bravo, and library.\nBut as we look ahead, we've got NBA coming, and sports has been a very key driver of Peacock with NFL, the Olympics, Premier League, the derby coming up this weekend, I think Big Ten, you know, and that's been important, acquiring new subs, getting engagement with our subs, and leading to engagement in non-sports content.\nSo we continue to think that acquiring the rights to bring the NBA back to NBC and Peacock is a big deal. It's a big accomplishment, a big moment. The team is working very hard to make sure, not just within sports, but across entertainment as well, with the new audience that we'll bring in over the years ahead, and we have it for 11 years, make sure that we use NBA as a launchpad to further scale Peacock and further monetize it. So I won't specifically talk about second half of this year or next year, but I do think, expect Peacock to be on a continuing trend of driving towards improved monetization, bigger scale, and therefore declining losses over time.\nSo that's the end, and you zoom back out and you put Peacock alongside the non-SpinCo media assets where they're hand in glove in terms of the skills, the DNA, and the legacy together with the rights across entertainment, news, sports, reality, and the like. And I think it's a business that will have some durability, too, and an ability to manage as one complete business over time. But I think you can expect us to continue to look to see, you know, improving trends in Peacock as time passes.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nHey Ben, let me hit the ARPU and profitability question. So taking my cue from Dave and a lot of what he said already, you know, as he said, expect healthy broadband ARPU growth this year. That's what we said on the Q4 call; continue to believe that. But I think the real focus is, you know, setting ourselves up for long term convergence, positioning, and revenue growth.\nAnd I think that's a lot of what you're seeing at this point. So the wireless opportunity plays a big role in that. If you think about our ability to accelerate wireless, which we did in the quarter and expect to continue to do over the course of the year, we're putting in place an expansion of how we're thinking about wireless, an extension of this into the base. 13% of our base has exposure to wireless right now.\nIt's a fantastic product, so we want more of our base to have it. And if you think about the pricing levers we're going to have over time, as you get to the one year mark and the two year mark and free one year, promotional customers roll into a paying relationship that, by the way, is still at a substantial discount to where market rates are.\nSo if they have exposure to our product, they like our product and then all of a sudden start paying for it, but at rates that are substantially lower than they can get elsewhere. We think that's a very good trade off and provides for upside in the future as it relates to how we monetize convergence relationships. I think on the broadband side, Dave pointed to it, as we look at the competitive environment, fiber is what it is.\nIt continues to creep into our footprint at 3% to 4% per year. That's no change from what we've seen in the past several years. We expect that to continue. But we've competed against fiber for 20+ years at this point, and it's a very predictable pattern that we haven't really seen changing. Sort of a pattern where the first three years there's significant market share gain, then it levels out.\nThe patterns we see in those markets, whether it's our own ARPU, churn rates, margins, et cetera, very much resemble our broader base. It's a segment we know how to compete well against. I would tell you that the newer competitor in the last few years has obviously been Fixed Wireless. They're adding 1 million subscribers per quarter. That's sort of the competitive intensity that we're seeing. That's sort of incremental.\nWe are competing aggressively with it. But if you think about the areas where Fixed Wireless is performed well, they're not leading with network, they're not leading with speed, they're not leading necessarily within home coverage, but they have a pricing construct in terms of simplicity and ease of doing business that has resonated. That's exactly what we're going after. Right.\nThat's exactly what the changes in the last couple months have been. And you'll see incremental changes from us going forward. So that's the investment activity we're talking about. Dave put some context around that and said, yeah, obviously this is going to make it more difficult to grow EBITDA this year. We effectively said that last quarter. I think that's where expectations are for us already.\nBut the other side of this, when we get through it, is really what we're positioning ourselves for, which is customers that are a heck of a lot more durable. They're on price plans that are sort of at market rates with long-term contractual guarantees, and then a discounted wireless offering that's more broadly exposed to our base gives us a heck of a pricing lever over time.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question today is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks. I guess. Excuse me, a couple of questions on media. A couple of quarters ago you said you were open to streaming consolidation. Can you give us your updated thoughts on that and maybe an update on timing of the cable SpinCo? You also announced this theme park in the UK and other parks in the US. Could you talk about how you're thinking about theme park like long-term TAM, as you expand into new markets?\nAnd I guess finally, I think Jason mentioned that obviously the industry, not just you, is very vulnerable to this lack of visibility and changing economic environment. Can you just talk about anything different than you're doing in your Upfront approach? You've mentioned NBA several times as a big driver for advertising, but maybe talk about NBA overall. Clearly you'll benefit on advertising and it's a positive for Peacock longer term. Can you help us frame the financial impact as these costs go up? Is there an affiliate fee increase that goes along with it? Thank you.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nCo-CEO, Comcast\n\nSo there's a bunch there. Let me kind of tick through those. It's Mike, Jessica. So, partnerships on Peacock. I think the point of my earlier commentary on Peacock and what we've built, I think it is fair to say that the broad audience appeal of Peacock with everything I described, our Pay-One movies, you know, NBC next-day content, Bravo, the library sports, including NBA, NFL, and the like, makes it a strong element of any future consumer bundle, whether that be through bundles or partnerships.\nSo, you know, point is we're doing our thing to make Peacock what we think the, you know, will be strong in the marketplace and if opportunities come along to partner up in bundles or otherwise, we'll be happy to consider those things if they make sense. But there's no news to report on that front. SpinCo, your second one. SpinCo continues. No change in our expectation of timing, you know, timing.\nAround the end of the year. I think UK parks. I just spent time answering another question, so I won't repeat myself, but I think we feel very strongly that the returns that we're getting, given our position and strength in the parks business as we know it today, gives us the right and opportunity to deploy capital in smaller opportunities which are the, you know, horror experience that will open in Vegas this year and the kids park in Frisco, Texas next year.\nBut we've looked around the world, you know. We're always looking for ways to put capital to work in our growth businesses. And the UK opportunity came along and we feel, you know, quite good about the prospects there. But I think to answer the broad question, which is what's our plan for the parks business? I think the plan is to keep driving growth in a business that we think we're one of two players in a market that is within media. Not at all exposed to the shift in time on screens from. One venue to another. I mean live experiences, parks experiences, you know, have been thrilling to people and we think we lean into that and continue to do so.\nAnd then finally, you know, up front, industry vulnerability, you know, nothing really to add there. I think, you know, we had, you know, all things considered, ad revenue was, you know, flat in Q1 when you adjust for timing of sports and political. And so impacts aren't yet really seen of the uncertainty that we're observing in the markets. But it may well be coming. So I think we're, we've got a great team led by Mark Marshall running ad sales. I think we're coming up with new products, new ways to leverage all the assets of NBCUniversal as we go into the marketplace.\nAnd then our content, all of it, but inclusive of the new content from NBA, is going to be a key anchor of, you know, what we look to do around the Upfronts and then more broadly as the future rolls in and we look to monetize Peacock, NBC, and Bravo. The stronger the portfolio, the more we deserve to command in all forms of revenue monetization. But no news to point to there today.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you. Maybe back to Dave on broadband. I'm just wondering if the churn commentary that you guys talked about in the quarter and maybe what you're seeing in business is there any sense that that can be driven by the slowing macro environment outside of what you may be seeing on the media side, because it doesn't seem like the competitive environment really changed that dramatically.\nWe went from sort of Q4 to Q1, and then digging in a little bit on the business side. Is it just small business where you guys are seeing the relationship trends get worse? Are you seeing anything on the government side, and can you talk a little bit about your government exposure after Verizon actually called out a little bit of weakness on the government side given what's going on on spending there? Thanks.\n\nDave Watson\n\nVice Chairman and CEO of Connectivity & Platforms, Comcast\n\nThis is Dave. So, talked about competition a lot of, you know, the one thing I'll just highlight the differences in uptick a little bit in mobile substitution. That's really, you know, Mike and Jason talked about, you know, the fiber continued three national, you know, the Fixed Wireless stable but still marketing very aggressively. So, I think that mobile substitution is the only difference, and it's just an uptick there, and it is in Business Services.\nI'd say most certainly small business. There's pressure there in terms of relationships, but our strategy is broad-based in terms of revenue generation and every relationship, and even small business. We're adding a lot of products and services to those relationships, really encouraged by that. And our focus has continued to shift, having done a nice job in small business to mid and enterprise customers.\nAnd that's where we're getting just a lot of traction as we provide complete answers for our customers in those segments, as we do connectivity to advanced services and adding a new part of the company, Nitel, which is great. So we're very excited about that. But the pressure is in small business.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, John. That will be our last question from the analyst community. I want to now hand the call over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nCharmain and CEO, Comcast",
    "content2": "So listening to all this, let me first comment on broadband and just add my own view where we're clearly facing some challenges. As you've heard with a lot of passion, the team has a sense of urgency, energy, and focus to getting customer pain points resolved. While this may take a little time to fully take hold, our history.\nOur operational execution success would tell you that while sometimes we may not move first, once we get in motion, we do it extremely well. We have real momentum in wireless and the path to continue to accelerate that. As we've seen in the market. Once it gets moving, it will allow more creativity in marketing. We have an industry-leading growth in Business Services at scale, and our investments to expand the opportunities, grow into new categories, and make it a $60 billion addressable market.\nVery excited about that. And Parks, I don't want to belate it. But I just would invite all of you to come visit Epic soon. Bring your family. I think you're in for a great experience. And later this year, on the content side, we have a terrific movie slate including Jurassic and Wicked.\nAmazing sports with the NBA as we just talked about. But also we broadcast the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics right at the same time, and the World Cup, which puts us in a very enviable position. So I really like our strategy. Our balance sheet strength regardless of global uncertainty. I feel we have a fantastic and unique company and I'm quite optimistic. Thanks everybody.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThank you everybody for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThank you, Operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website, and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and Trending Schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nGood morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. We are very proud that the company produced record revenue of $124 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $38 billion in 2024. In addition, we grew adjusted EPS by 9% and generated substantial free cash flow of $12.5 billion. This is despite the intense competition and strategic challenges that we faced across our businesses and in our residential connectivity business in particular. Broadband revenue grew 3% for the year, and converged revenue, which we define as domestic broadband and wireless revenue, grew nearly 5%, which is among the best performance across the converged players.\nDespite our incumbent status in broadband and as we faced continued overbuilding, fixed wireless expansion, and the challenges associated with the end of the ACP program. As you've already seen in our earnings release, net broadband subscriber additions were negative 139,000 in Q4, which is disappointing and worse than what we indicated in early December. Dave will discuss in more detail when we get to Q&A, but in short, competitive conditions remain intense, dynamic, and varied across our footprint and customer segments, and we see no signs of this changing in the near term.\nDave is not sitting still in this environment, and he will discuss later in the call the actions that his team has underway. But let me be clear that all of us continue to strongly believe in the long-term opportunity for our connectivity business despite the need to adjust to the ever-evolving competitive environment. Zooming back out in 2024, we made substantial progress in each of our six growth businesses.\nTo run through each one briefly, first, residential domestic broadband revenue grew 3% as I just mentioned. Second, in wireless revenue grew at a mid-teens rate, and we added another 1.2 million lines, taking us to 7.8 million as of year-end and to 12% penetration of our broadband customer base. Third, we delivered strong results in Business Services, growing revenue and EBITDA at mid-single-digit rates, and we continue to identify new growth opportunities like our recently announced plans to acquire Nitel, which will enhance our capabilities to serve multi-site enterprise and mid-market businesses.\nToday Comcast Business is nearly $10 billion in revenue and in a $60 billion addressable market in the U.S. Fourth, in streaming, we achieved a $1 billion improvement in Peacock EBITDA losses and delivered on the promise of streaming with the excellent execution of the Paris Olympics. Fifth is our studio business where we ranked second in global box office, making it the third year in a row where we've been either number one or number two. And our TV Studios ended the broadcast season with more top 10 series than any other studio. And finally, in our Destinations & Experiences business, we finished the year strong across our Parks globally.\nAfter having experienced some temporary headwinds in the middle of the year, our team stayed hard at work preparing for the opening of Epic Universe in May of this year. Now turning to 2025, our plans call for us to make progress on all of these fronts again, but let me highlight two areas for deeper commentary. First is Dave's action plan. Behind the commitment to drive continued growth in broadband and convergence revenue, we will lean into wireless more than ever before. We are the challenger in a market that is two and a half times the size of broadband with a capital-light strategy that does not require network trade-offs.\nWireless is a meaningful differentiator as our converged offers provide great savings to the consumer, and so you will see us shift our strategy to package mobile with more of our higher-tier broadband products both for new and many of our existing customers. In addition, we will be capitalizing on our broadband and Wi-Fi network capabilities by automatically boosting the speeds of Xfinity Mobile customers by up to 1 Gbps whenever they connect to our 23 million Wi-Fi hotspots, which is the largest and fastest Wi-Fi network in North America.\nNext is our world-class broadband network, which consistently delivers peak performance even as internet traffic increases at double-digit rates. This fall alone we saw NFL streaming and large game downloads drive the biggest consumption in internet history. These trends play to our strengths as we have the best path to deliver data in the most cost-efficient way over the long term. So a top priority is driving our broadband network upgrade that will ultimately deliver multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds across every market we serve and incorporate AI throughout our entire network.\nProject Genesis, as we call it, is making great progress. Today, over 50% of our network is fully virtualized, and we will reach about 70% by the end of this year. Now that we are more than halfway through, we will be introducing new pricing and packaging in the upgraded markets in the coming months that will bundle wireless and internet with faster upload speeds and simplified all-in pricing with the goal of removing points of friction with our customers. Finally, we are creating new products designed to appeal to our key customer segments and provide more flexibility with attractive pricing.\nOne example is our sports and news TV package announced just last week that combines the best linear networks along with Peacock at a price that is competitive against virtual MVPDs. We know sports fans want and need great broadband, and we will continue to look for packages like these to sell more Xfinity Internet and to lower churn for existing subscribers which together increase customer lifetime value. Helping Dave across all of these priorities will be Steve Croney, who in the past month was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of Connectivity & Platforms.\nHis areas of responsibility are Comcast residential and commercial businesses, including product strategy, sales and marketing, customer experience, field operations, and data analytics. Steve will serve as a catalyst as we push even harder for progress across the range of initiatives I just laid out. Now moving to Content & Experiences, the big news of the fourth quarter was our decision to spin off a strong portfolio of cable television networks and digital assets to our shareholders in a tax-free transaction that we estimate will be completed at the end of the year.\nEarlier this month, we announced key appointments to the future senior leadership team for this new company with Mark Lazarus as CEO and Anand Kini as CFO and Chief Operating Officer. As a well-capitalized independent company with a focused management team and strong portfolio of news, sports, and genre-based entertainment, SpinCo will be well positioned to lead in the changing cable and digital media landscape. Importantly, the creation of SpinCo will be a positive catalyst for what I've been calling future NBCUniversal. First, let me define what that looks like.\nWhen we announced SpinCo in November, we also announced a restructuring of the remaining NBCU Media businesses which will operate together and consist of the NBC Broadcast Network with NBC Sports which is the home of the NFL, the Olympics, the Premier League, NASCAR, Golf, and later this year the NBA and Bravo which is a leader in reality television and home of beloved franchises including the Real Housewives and Below Deck. Together, NBC and Bravo reach 100 million U.S. households each month and help power Peacock.\nThen there's Peacock itself which in four years has built a base of 36 million subscribers and integrates original programming, Universal films, and exclusive sports and news as well as NBC News, the leading news organization in the United States, plus Telemundo, America's number one Spanish-language content powerhouse and our local stations.\nWith our media business now focused on streaming and broadcast, alongside our growing Studios and destinations, and experiences businesses, the future NBCU will continue to be one of the largest media companies in the world. With nearly $40 billion in annual revenue, NBCU will be on a growth trajectory fueled by our world-class content, technology, IP properties, and talent all working in concert with each other as an integrated media company. Our extraordinary Parks business and industry-leading film and TV Studios are already positioned for long-term success.\nTheme parks will be supercharged by the opening of Epic Universe, the most technologically advanced theme park ever. Just last week our film studio earned a total of 25 Oscar nominations, the most in the studio's history. This is on the heels of a hugely successful run for Wicked, which, at over $700 million at the global box office, has become the highest-grossing film based on a Broadway musical. So to wrap up, I want to reiterate the confidence that our entire management team has in our business, allowing us to again raise our dividend by a healthy $0.08 per share.\nThrough our dividend payments and share repurchases, we have now returned more than $55 billion to shareholders since 2021 when we resumed our buyback program. And while we've demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, we've been transparent that our first priority is to reinvest to set ourselves up for revenue growth, and we've done so consistently across six key growth drivers. We expect this formula to guide us in 2025 and the years ahead.\nBefore I turn it over to Jason, I'd like to close by saying that our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the devastating wildfires. I am in awe of the first responders and others on the front lines, and grateful to our news teams on the ground covering this tragedy and sharing vital information, as well as the operations teams and everyone in the community who have rallied to support people in this difficult time. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I want to start with a high level overview of our consolidated results. Total revenue grew 2% for both the fourth quarter and the full year with our six major growth drivers including residential, broadband, wireless, Business Services, connectivity, theme parks, streaming, and premium content in our Studios increasing at a mid single digit rate and now comprising close to 60% of our total revenue. On a reported basis, we grew EBITDA 10% to $8.8 billion for the fourth quarter and 1% to $38.1 billion for the full year. Excluding severance and other in both years, EBITDA grew 8% in the quarter and 1% for the full year.\nAdjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.96 in the fourth quarter and 9% to $4.33 for the full year. We generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow for the quarter and $12.5 billion for the full year, returning over 100% of this to shareholders with $13.5 billion of capital returned for the full year.\nNow I'd like to touch on broadband, where we lost 139,000 customers in the quarter while we grew ARPU 3.1%. Importantly, our measuring stick is revenue growth, and on that score for the full year we grew broadband revenue 3% and convergence revenue by 5%. And into 2025 we expect broadband revenue to continue on a growth trajectory with convergence revenue again growing at an even faster pace than broadband revenue. Our view over the near term is that fiber operators will continue to overbuild us and fixed wireless operators will continue to sell into remaining excess capacity.\nLonger term, our view is that we will face fiber as the primary competition in most of our footprint. In effect, there will be two multi-gig symmetrical wires in the vast majority of homes that we serve.\nIn addition, there will be opportunistic capacity constrained competitors carving out a permanent part of the market in the form of fixed wireless and likely satellite as well. That shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. That is and has for quite a while now been our view of the long term structural and competitive characteristics of the broadband market. Along those lines, let me remind you that we've competed against fiber for over 20 years and during this time we have generally seen a repeated pattern where new fiber builds gain early market share wins and then settle into fairly equal market share amongst providers over the medium to longer term.\nDespite the increased competition, these markets maintain strong ARPU characteristics in line with non-fiber markets.\nKeep in mind that this past experience versus fiber was with prior generation cable networks where fiber was able to market a significant speed advantage. That's increasingly not the case now and will not be the case in the future where multi-gig symmetrical parity will exist among both of us and will further differentiate our offering with everything that we surround around broadband like whole-home coverage, control, security, aggregation, best-in-home Wi-Fi, and added value in wireless.\nSpeaking of wireless, we have an incredible hand in convergence underpinned by a ubiquitous broadband network, product differentiation, and a super competitive wireless product available to all of our customers. In fact, in convergence terms, while we are the incumbent in the $80 billion U.S. residential broadband market, we are the challenger in the far larger $200 billion U.S. wireless market.\nWireless is an integral part of our broadband strategy. It reduces churn and is a key acquisition tool and a driver of our strong convergence revenue growth, which has been in the mid single digits and at the high end of our telecom peers and competitors. And with 7.8 million total wireless lines, which is 12% penetration of our residential broadband customer base or around 6% of our total passings, we have a long runway ahead.\nFinally, on Business Services, the fourth quarter, the full year 2024, and our outlook for 2025 all fit within the same framework, and that is within small- and medium-sized business segment, we're operating in the same competitive environment as residential broadband, and similarly, despite the elevated competition, we are delivering nice revenue growth in this segment driven by higher adoption of our suite of advanced services that deepens the relationship with our large base of customers.\nAdd in significant progress in revenue growth we're seeing across larger enterprise and government contracts, and the overall category of Business Services has been growing at an industry-leading mid-single-digit range with a total revenue base approaching $10 billion and a margin at nearly 57% as of year-end.\nPutting this all together, in the quarter, Connectivity & Platforms revenue remained consistent with the prior year as 5% growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by revenue declines in video and other, while EBITDA grew 2% and margins expanded by another 80 basis points when excluding severance and other in both periods. Looking ahead, we intend to lean into wireless, which means additional investment there, but the overall framework for growth over the long term remains the same, a mix shift driven by continued strong growth in our connectivity businesses, which creates opportunity for further margin expansion.\nThe same dynamics that have driven our results for the past several years, and we still believe we can deliver that in 2025 despite certain higher areas of investment.\nIn addition, we landed our CapEx intensity at just over 10% in 2024 and expect to continue in and around this range for 2025. This all creates continued favorable characteristics for strong and growing net cash flow generation coming out of Connectivity & Platforms. In the Content & Experiences segment, I would frame the business as follows. In Parks, we're seeing some stabilization after a slowdown in Q2 and Q3, adjusted for Epic pre-opening costs of around $35 million. EBITDA in Q4 was flat year-over-year, with attendance trends improving across most of our Parks, including Orlando, solidifying the foundation for our opening of Epic Universe in May.\nWe couldn't be more excited for the launch of Epic.\nWe've also been clear we will have significant costs leading up to this opening, with over $100 million or the vast majority landing in the first quarter. In addition, we will have incremental domestic marketing spend as well as an impact from the tragic fires that have raged around Hollywood.\nOur Studios continue to deliver as this was the third straight year in which we've been in the top two in global box office, and we are excited about the 2025 slate, which includes How to Train Your Dragon, Jurassic World Rebirth, and Wicked: For Good, just to name a few. While we expect another strong theatrical and Peacock run, studio EBITDA growth will be impacted in 2025 by higher marketing expenses tied to a larger film slate and lower carryover from prior years given the writers and actors strikes in 2023.\nIn Media, we are making a successful pivot to streaming as evidenced by Peacock's strong revenue growth of 46% for the full year, driving a $1 billion improvement in Peacock's EBITDA loss, and we expect to make continued improvement in Peacock EBITDA losses in 2025.\nWe couldn't be more excited for the year ahead as we welcome the NBA back to NBC and also on Peacock later this year. To put 2024 in perspective, we dealt with potentially the most competitive environment we faced in broadband, saw an unexpected but significant temporary slowdown in theme parks, and made major investments in our key growth initiatives. Yet when you sum it all up, we grew, adjusted EPS nearly double digits, and generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow, speaking to the overall breadth and resilience of our business.\nAt the same time, we maintained a healthy balance sheet, ending the year with net leverage at 2.3 times while returning $13.5 billion to shareholders, including over $8.5 billion in share repurchases.\nSince we restarted our buyback program in 2021, we've reduced our share count by nearly 20% and see significant room to continue to deliver on this trajectory. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nHearing all of that, I'm certainly proud that we had the best year in our 60-year history with record revenue, EBITDA, and EPS along with significant free cash flow, all while returning so much capital to shareholders and never take any of that for granted. Our team is executing in industries that are going through rapid and exciting transformation, and it's our founding principle to lean into that change and constantly look for new growth as we have always done.\nI also like to step back and think about our assets from our 64 million homes passed with really fast gig speed internet to our robust backbone with hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber, localized data centers complete with space, power, and connectivity.\nTogether this network gives us a competitive advantage in the markets we serve, but also importantly positions us really well for new growth opportunities and in a world hungry for connectivity that will be increasingly driven by AI and edge computing. So as we turn the page to the coming year, there's a lot to be excited about, starting with our most recent Comcast Business acquisition of Nitel, the launch of Epic Universe, much awaited, and our new 11-year deal that will welcome the NBA back to NBC, just to name a few. We have a wonderful company, but nothing beats good execution.\nAs you heard, our team is already hard at work and energized for what lies ahead in 2025 and beyond. Marci, now over to you for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star and then the number one on touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star and the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers once again. If there are any questions, press star then the number one on your touch-tone phone.\nOur first question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning. I want to come back to your comments on wireless. Obviously you guys are excited about that opportunity and seem to be. I think Mike used the word shifting strategies a bit. Should we be expecting net adds to accelerate? Is that what success looks like there? And any more comments you can give around the investments that Jason mentioned and kind of removing friction, thinking about things like handset subsidies, et cetera.\nAnd then I know you talked about it, but I don't know if Brian is willing to comment on just the vision for NBC's Media business sort of post this spinoff, kind of wrapped in sports and broadcast. But like longer term, how do you think about the growth opportunities for what we used to think about as kind of the television business at NBC. Thanks so much.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nHey Ben, I'll start, and then maybe Dave can chime in on wireless and Brian on Media. I'd like to start on that one too. But so on wireless, yeah, I think we're pleased that we've gotten to 12% penetration. I think we have a very good hand as you think about offering a converged offering to consumers with the best broadband product out there across 63 million homes, together with the ability to put a mobile phone in people's hands with a good value on the best network with the best devices.\nSo we've been at it for a few years, and I think we like what we see, and our intention is to push harder. We've seen Charter try some things that we have watched and seen what they're doing. So I think pushing for more simplified bundles.\nOne thing we talked about in the earlier comments is how as we've rolled out our network upgrades, it's going to both enable stronger products, a stronger converged product across mobile and broadband, together with the friction points, is putting some more simplicity in the offers themselves and the way we go to market with broadband and wireless together. And I think in addition to that, we're going to be looking at trying to attach and penetrate our existing base of customers, not just new customers, but especially those in our highest value wireless cohorts.\nSo all that will have some, you know, impact on, you know, as we, you know, invest behind success. And that's what Jason was referring to. Dave, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYeah, Mike. So Ben, we had certainly some success with our prior approach leading up to this moment with wireless and buy one, get one. It's been. We were pleased with that, but felt it was the right moment to shift strategy to package mobile.\nRight in, included with.\nInto more of our higher tier broadband products. This is a fundamental shift that will impact acquisition, base management, and retention to be included. So included mobile. And it's all towards the effort that both Mike and Jason have talked about our overall goal of driving converged revenue, and just to add one last thought on wireless, you know, as I think about the industry opportunity when they went from four to three.\nThat makes it a business where you tend to see price go up and that creates a better business opportunity for a new entrant like ourselves. And so all the dynamics would appear to make that a good growth for many, many years to come. I think for the media business.\nThe Spin, you know, just want to echo that I think makes a lot of sense. 98% of the viewing on Peacock does not include this spun networks, so they need their own direct to consumer digital initiatives, focus, and investment. I think Mark Lazarus, Anand Kini, and the team are going to do a superb job. We're, you know, it'll take a little while to get that launched. But one of the things Mike did was begin to operate the company as if it's already happened. So, you know, we've got a whole new team in the remaining media businesses, and the leadership that we've announced is in place and functioning.\nWe were just meeting the other day, and they have a pretty exciting roadmap. You know, it starts with Epic Universe this May in the television business.\nTo your question, I think that the content we make works on Peacock. We are also a provider to other platforms. I think we sell content to every platform. And I think with the addition of something like the NBA, combined with the Olympics, combined with Sunday Night Football, combined with Premier League, and then shows like Day of the Jackal, we have something called The Americas coming up, which will be on NBC. And using NBC to drive Peacock and vice versa more than maybe we have in the past. It's a very exciting business. So.\nMike, you want to add anything on that piece of the question?\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nI think that it really. I agree with everything you said. I think it does two things. One is I think the assets that are going to SpinCo are strong, as many of us have observed. But the fact of the matter, as Brian called out the 98% quote, they weren't integral to the emphasis we've put on Peacock and a streaming future for NBC broadcast in particular. And so I think those assets are going to be better managed and have opportunities in the future that are better optimized for our shareholders by putting them in the hands of the strong leadership team Brian described with, you know, light debt and sort of strength.\nSo that is an area getting management focus has always proven to me to be, you know, there's great ideas that many of us have as we got this started, and I think Mark and Anand have come up with several others, and it's more to come. What it leaves is an equally focused management team under Donna Langley and Matt Strauss that are now taking the NBC broadcast assets together with Bravo, which Brian didn't mention, sort of the leader in reality television, both of which feed substantially the viewing in Peacock itself, along with Pay-One movies, sports, and the like.\nAnd I think the opportunity that that team sees in bringing together in a way that I don't think would be possible without separating the two different businesses, they'll create a cohesive management team across programming.\nSo, what content gets greenlit with a complete end-to-end view about how you could window across NBC Broadcast, or Bravo, or Peacock, and back and forth, make investments that are really end-to-end, and get their management teams streamlined, frankly, so that quicker, better decisions get made in support of a singular remaining streaming focus. But with an important linear elements to it in terms of Bravo and NBC, that I think opens up what we've been talking about for a while, which is that we're not really running a Peacock-only strategy, we're running a broadcast-plus streaming strategy, and looking to optimize that over the years ahead.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nLast point I would make is Mike.\nYou have, you stepped into this, figured.\nIt was executed extremely well. There's more energy about to step up in both parts, SpinCo and the RemainingCo. So we're very excited, and your leadership is noticed and appreciated.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks Ben.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nOperator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Craig Moffett. From MoffettNathanson, please go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you, Dave. Staying with the broadband business for a minute. Can you talk about what you've learned in your Project Genesis markets?\nYou talked about now leaning into marketing and promotion around letting people know that that's done. Talk about what that looks like if you would, and what you expect will be different in the markets where you now have a symmetrical broadband offering with speeds that are sort of fiber-like if you would.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYou got it.\nHey Craig, so you know, what first off what we're pleased with, what we're learning is we're right on track in terms of Genesis. We've 50% of the first phase completed, and we're moving at a very good clip. Vast majority of the plant have that mid-split side of things upgraded by the end of this year. So we're pleased with it operationally, we're pleased with the architecture, the promise of virtualizing elements of it. So we can introduce all the things that Mike mentioned in regards to how we manage the network day in day out that keeps it efficient and effective as a network. So we made significant progress.\nBut maybe the biggest point to what we're saying today is you know we're certainly. This is a fast roadmap to ubiquitous multi-gig symmetrical.\nBut we're not waiting; we are moving now on the first phase as we upgrade the plant to be able to introduce the simplified packaging that I think will make a difference in the marketplace. This will obviously have our best tiers of broadband. Mobile will be included. It's really simplified, and reducing a lot of the pain points that we've seen in the marketplace.\nSo including a faster path to everyday pricing. So it is a, I think, a really important moment for us. We're pleased about this opportunity to be able to get going and expect, you know, Q2 that we would begin to put the pedal down on that effort.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nDave, can you share any learnings for how competition is different in those places or is it still too early because you haven't really launched the marketing around it yet?\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYeah, it is still too early, Craig. We'll launch the simplified packaging side of things in Q2. But what we have seen is that it's an important first step of upgrading speed capability, and you combine that with great Wi-Fi in the homes. It's a good fundamental step forward.\nBut it's too early to talk about the competitive shift until we get the full marketing going.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nGot it.\nThank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Craig. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you for the question. I just have two. First, on domestic broadband, could you just talk a little bit about the ARPU outlook?\nShould we expect ARPU growth to accelerate from here, just given the absence of things like hurricane rebates and some of the price increases implemented at the beginning of this year? Then, for Jason, I was just wondering if you could talk about free cash flow for next year. Obviously, a few moving parts between cash taxes, the cash tax refund, and CapEx potentially coming down in C&E. So, any thoughts? That would be great. Thank you.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nMichael, this is Dave. Let me start with your point on ARPU. So we expect continued healthy ARPU growth. Our overall focus is on broadband and convergence revenue growth, though that is the main point, as Mike and Jason have called out. And good news is there are different levers we have and we will continue to pull. But in the context of how we, you know, we really are focused on maximizing overall revenue growth. So in a dynamic environment, we've got those levers to pull and we will make the right decisions to optimize the levers to build, you know, longer term sustainable revenue growth.\nSo as I mentioned before, we are implementing, you know, a number of new approaches and we'll continue to make, you know, the best decisions for now and in the long term. So let me give you an example.\nWhenever we accelerate wireless and pushing harder there, we think it's the right, smart, competitive decision. We may not be right within the range that we have been, but still expect ARPU to be very healthy.\nJason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nYeah, Mike, thanks for the question. So let me round out free cash flow, maybe step back a little bit. We gave an outlook on the call for a number of different parts of the business. As you get down to free cash flow, I'll step you through views on working capital, maybe complete the picture on CapEx. And then you mentioned cash taxes as well. So starts with what's the underlying base? The underlying base is very healthy free cash flow generation. As you saw in 2024, we generated $12.5 billion. That's in the context of we did have a $2 billion one-time headwind that we called out in the second quarter.\nSo really, really free cash flow was probably $2 billion ahead of that. That's how we look at the baseline for 2024 and then entering into 2025. You're right.\nYou know, in the release today, we did talk about a tailwind to cash taxes in 2025. That'll be roughly $2 billion. So that's going to be a tailwind to us. We'll be clear about that at the time. And I would view that as a one time thing, but nonetheless helpful relative to 2024 where cash taxes went the other way. Working capital is another sort of key part to this. I think we're, it's tough to guide with total visibility and predictability. But I would point you to the last couple of years. 2024, working capital headwind was about $1.5 billion. 2023 was roughly $2 billion.\nThose in rough terms are probably the right goalposts to think about for 2025. And if you step back, the key things that cause working capital headwinds are attached to our growth businesses.\nIt's handset subsidies, it's production around a lot of the streaming properties, it's sports rights. So those are all still in place for 2025 and beyond. So that's, that's what that category will look like. But hopefully that helps there. And then on capital intensity, we were clear about cable capital intensity. We landed the year at just over 10%. That's the outlook for 2025, and that's in the context of very strong new homes passed, continue to really be aggressive in passing and new home formations. So we'll continue to invest pretty aggressively there, but within that capital intensity envelope, and feel comfortable about that.\nAnd then on the Content & Experiences side, you're right to point out we are nearing the tail end of the Epic sort of construction phase, and so we will get relief from that over the course of 2025.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you, Jason.\nThank you, Dave.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks, guys. Following up on the wireless commentary, I'm wondering if you can get it. It looks like revenue growth was strong this quarter, even in the context of pretty strong subscriber growth. I'm wondering if you can help pull apart how much of that growth came from ARPU growth in wireless versus equipment revenue. And then we've been hearing.\nThat the MVNO contract could be up for renewal this year. I'm wondering if you could give us some context for what you expect in pricing when that renewal does come up and how it might impact margins in the wireless business. Thanks.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nSo, Jonathan, let me start with wireless growth, and sort of, I think your question really was sort of service versus equipment. I would tell you very healthy growth in wireless. We added 1.2 million subs year-over-year. That translated into mid-teens revenue growth. And if you were to break it down in terms of service versus equipment, service revenue growth was sort of right in that range as well.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nYeah.\nJonathan, Dave, no new news in.\nTerms of the MVNO approach. We're pleased with our current position, and as Brian opened up, you know where the marketplace has consolidated. Cable's in a unique position to be able to drive real value not only for us, but for our partner. So we're no new news though at.\nthis point, and I think I might just add in, and we're a sizable partner at this stage, which is important as you think about the, and we're not the only one in the partnership with Verizon on wireless. So I think that's different than the discussions from years past.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you. Maybe switching gears a little bit from the new strategy. Last quarter you announced the restructuring SpinCo and maybe plans to consolidate on streaming. Can you give us any update? Do you think the market will consolidate in streaming? Any commentary for M&A in terms of cable? Will scale help your competitive position in broadband and wireless, and I guess Media? Are there any pieces that you think are still missing or you would benefit from scale? And then on SpinCo, can you maybe discuss the strategy a little bit more? You mentioned that you alluded to streaming, but is the focus going to be on sports, news, acquisitions, or cost cutting?\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nSure, it's Mike. I'll start and Brian can finish. I mean, just quickly on SpinCo, it's exactly as I said earlier. I mean, the assets that go into SpinCo are leaders in genre-based entertainment, sports, and news. I think running those businesses well, which the team leadership team will do.\nIt's the job at hand. They're working together, you know, naming new leaders and putting together a strategy. So when they're ready to talk about what their strategy will be at some point down the road, you know, we'll come back. But I think the idea certainly is that they're a freestanding, strong collection of businesses with lots of cash flow generation capability for many years to come, good market positions, and now great focus. So I think I'm optimistic that that creates good opportunities for our shareholders. However, Mark and Anand really decide to take that strategy forward.\nYou know, you know, the remaining Media business inside NBCU that I commented on earlier. I think it's set up to, you know, we're not looking to need anything other than our own assets and our own focus.\nSo getting again, Donna and Matt aligned with the teams underneath and combining the assets that we have today that I mentioned earlier into a new media group is, I think, creates great fuel for the streaming strategy that is Peacock for those NBC assets. When you zoom, would we be interested in partnerships? Absolutely. We'll, you know, have, you know, we're wide open to, as I said, you know, when we announced on the last earnings call, openness to possibilities of partnerships, bundling; we'll consider, we'll consider anything.\nSo but I think the point of it in partnerships is what do you bring to the table, and you know, getting our assets very tightly focused around a strong strategy for Peacock, I think enables, you know, us to be a good partner.\nAny partnerships that may or may not come to pass, but if they don't come to pass, I think we're fine running what we have. When you expand more widely to the whole Media or Content & Experiences business, you put that new media company with NBC, Peacock, Bravo, and the like alongside a leading studio business that is, you know, a grower, high value, great leadership, and sustained success over the past several years, and great slates coming in this year and 2026, and a TV Studios business that will now be under Pearlena Igbokwe or had been, but along with other NBC network and the like as we go forward for programming decisions along with Donna.\nI think that sets the Studios up for sustained success and growth. Lastly, Parks, which we talked about before.\nSo when you look at the what remains in the aggregate media company, it's a strong, strong business, one of the best in the country, if not the world. And I think it sets a very high bar for thinking about whether any kind of M&A in that space would be accretive to us versus just running the businesses we have. And that's the work we've been doing to sort of streamline our businesses. So we like what we have with or without anything inorganic. So that's the media side and Brian can come in on top of that.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nLook, I think that's a pretty very complete answer just on SpinCo. I would say one of the two other points is that we have first mover. We've heard others now talking about perhaps similar idea of the same. And secondly, we're going to have, they're going to have a great balance sheet, probably the envy of many, which will allow them to have the pick of what strategy, Jessica, to employ there. And I think we want to give them the time and space to figure that out. And as Mike said, they'll be back and anxious to tell you that strategy. But I think that's not going to happen until later in the year.\nAnd I think just generally, you know, you can apply the answer you gave to Media on the rest of the world. We're looking, we always look at everything and think about everything.\nI think that's our job as management. That's been. But we have a high bar, and we don't do things very often. And you look at the situations and make the best judgment you can. Sitting here today, the company with 38, the company we just reported with the best year in 60 years, with all the various things we've just been talking about on the call, you know, revenue growth, EBITDA growth, free cash flow.\nJason a while ago kind of created an algorithm goal for us which is to take maybe slower EBITDA growth and historically, but given the CapEx profile, tax profile, you end up with a free cash flow with your buying back stock, you end up with an EPS and free cash flow per share kind of reliable performance that gets you to the kind of 9%, I think you said, growth kind of close to double digits. So that algorithm something has to really help that algorithm accelerate. So I like what we've got, and I thought Mike's answer covered some of the specifics on the media side.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThank you. Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Maybe for Dave, back on the broadband question, just the change you guys saw in December, was that you think that was more from competition? And then if so, could you break it down or were you seeing more pressure from fiber to home or fixed wireless? And you mentioned satellite for the first time. Are you actually seeing that now or is there some expectation in the future? And then for Jason, one of the things where you guys have been very successful over the last few years is improving margins in cable or on the connectivity side.\nDid that equation still hold as we look forward considering the new strategy to combine broadband and wireless more aggressively? Thanks.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey John, this is Dave. Let me start. So as Mike led off with right away, it may have been a little too optimistic with what we were seeing in the more price-conscious segment in the earlier part of the quarter in December. But you know, the main point bringing us back up, it's intensely competitive in all segments. So it's a little bit of a shift. But it's, you know, you have fixed wireless, while it's leveled, they're still out there aggressively marketing, and you got fiber that's overbuilding. So that has continued.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nHey John, let me hit your questions on margins, which I think was in the C&P segment. So we've had a, you know, obviously a really good history of driving margin expansion. The things that broadly contribute to that and I think as I said in the upfront remarks are mix shift in the business. Number one, more and more of our business moving to connectivity, which is a higher margin business. Number two, it's sort of interactions, if you will, with customer service interactions. So whether that's truck rolls, incoming calls to our call centers, we've given you stats historically about each one of those metrics being down 40% to 50% in the last five or six years.\nSo the underpinnings of that continue. As you saw, we expanded margins at a pretty healthy clip in 2024.\nAs I said in the earlier remarks, we expect to continue to be able to expand margins maybe at a slightly lower rate this year given the investments we want to make back into the business, including wireless. But nonetheless continued very healthy margins in an absolute sense where we're industry leading, and then on a relative basis and the ability to grow, I think continued momentum there. I would, as we step back and look at the you know, a couple of the architects in that business, you know, we mentioned earlier, and we put out a press release last week about Steve Croney taking on additional responsibilities.\nHe's been CFO of the C&P business for the last several years. Incredible financial discipline across the organization.\nSo great that he's able to spread his wings and do more and really lean on some of the things that Dave, you know, has outlined here on this call. But kudos to him and the team for driving the type of margin expansion we've talked about, seen, and expect to continue to see.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nAnd John, one more follow up to your point on satellite. Just to clarify, the two main ones are the ones I mentioned between fixed wireless and fiber, satellite. We see it just been de minimis. It's not been a material thing for us. Not being dismissive of it though. We're going to watch it very closely. But we see it being more active in rural areas and not so much in suburban urban areas at this point at all.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, John. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. I just wanted to go back to the broadband ARPU dynamics. I think you said very healthy ARPU growth. But as you do lean into mobile, what we've seen with some of your peers is there is some dilution to ARPU. You've historically managed to this really strong 3% to 4% growth. So just wondering if you're shifting that strategy a little bit around that 3% to 4% growth as you move into more of the converged bundle. And then on Peacock, thank you for the guidance for losses to improve. I'm just wondering if that's true in the second half of the year as well when the NBA costs come online and push OpEx higher. I know revenue is going to step up too.\nJust trying to figure out if you think the NBA will be positive to Peacock EBITDA in 2025 or if it's a bit of a headwind, and then kind of ex-NBA. There's a lot of improvements going on beneath the surface. Thank you.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident and CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nThank you. Hey Steven, this is Dave. Let me start with ARPU and a couple of points on that.\nYou did hit it. That mobile is an important part of our future has been great contributor for a long period of time, but we're excited about accelerating our focus. But there are a number of levers that we have when it comes to ARPU, and we'll manage all of them. As we roll out the new packaging approach, we're certainly focused on all segments, but this is following upgrades to our plant and really focused, hyper focused, on the high end, always have been, will continue to be, so that that will certainly impact and leads us to our focus on continued healthy ARPU growth. When you add mobile to your packages in the simple way that we're talking about, there could be some impact to ARPU.\nBut we think the returns are terrific, and for competitive reasons it's absolutely the right thing to do over the long run. But we still are very, very focused on all levers that would contribute to ARPU.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast",
    "content2": "I think along those lines we've been very clear as it relates to North Star for us is how do you continue to grow broadband revenue at a healthy clip, and ultimately how do you grow convergence revenue at an even better clip? Right. So in the past year we grew broadband revenue at 3%, we grew convergence revenue at 5%. Interesting. If you stack us up versus peers and competitors. We realize there's a lot of focus, you know, on broadband sub trajectory. But if you step back, we are at or near industry leading levels for convergence revenue growth.\nSo the focus here is continue that find the levers we have to go push into that. It's not to say we can't have strong broadband ARPU growth. We gave an outlook that broadband ARPU growth will continue to be healthy.\nBut as we look at the levers we have to go drive wireless growth, to drive continued broadband growth, to compete aggressively in the markets, and really deliver on everything. Dave said he's coming to the market with, in particular in the second quarter, we got a lot of levers, and we have a clear North Star around what we're growing.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nOne other thing that in terms of revenue Jason hit it perfectly. But I would offer Business Services revenue is a tremendous opportunity, has been, will be. Overall we're a leader. When you compare Business Services growth in terms of our peers and our competitors, it's $10 billion revenue, great margins, and we have consistently contributed revenue and EBITDA growth. So going right to Jason's point in terms of our focus on overall revenue, Business Services is an enormously important part.\nOf what we do.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nSteven on Peacock, thanks for the question there. I think we're looking forward to the NBA. It was a big kind of get and it's going to be the major additive content that will drive, be the driver of subscriber growth I would expect in 2025 for us. So, in terms of, don't really think about halves as I, what we'll see this year is, as I said, improvement in Peacock revenues and losses.\nAnd then as we absorb NBA in the second half of the year, what will happen then is over the remainder of the full first season, together with the seasoning of the management changes with Matt and Donna that I described, plus SpinCo, we'll be working through a whole bunch of ways in which we absorb the cost that will step up through price increases, shifting ad sales to higher value content that the NBA brings, and repositioning some of the programming that the NBA will displace. So all the things we talked about, but that'll take. I would give us the full first season of NBA into second season before we sort of normalized our business to handle the higher expense there.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nSo I think that's it, everybody. Appreciate you guys spending the time with us this morning.\nHappy New Year.\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in listening only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nThank you, operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before I hand it over to Jason, I'd like to comment on three key elements from the quarter. One, broadband; two, parks; and three, the NBA. So first is broadband, where the competitive intensity that we've seen for the past several quarters and which is particularly felt in the market for price-conscious consumers remains essentially unchanged. But throughout this period, our broadband strategy has been consistent, and we remain confident in our plan. We are focused on generating healthy broadband revenue growth by striking the right balance between rate and volume and relying heavily on market segmentation that I'll speak to in a minute. As a result, in the second quarter, ARPU grew 3.6%, which was within our historical range of 3% to 4%.\nDespite the competitiveness of the recent past, we've maintained a market-leading base of 32 million broadband customers by refining our go-to-market approach to create options that fit each of our customers' lifestyles and budgets. Providing the best products with flexibility and choice at different value points has served us extremely well for many years and remains the core of our playbook. Of particular note, this quarter we launched our suite of NOW products, which are high-quality Internet, mobile, and streaming TV offerings designed to be incredibly simple with attractive all-in pricing with no contracts or credit checks. These are great options for the price-conscious segment and especially for those impacted by the end of the government's ACP program.\nWhile we are pleased with our enhancement to our offerings for the price conscious segment, the reality is that the vast majority of our customer base subscribes to more premium products where we feel great about our market position relative to fiber, which is our true long term competitor. We are investing in additional network capacity, multi-gig speeds, and in-home Wi-Fi technology to capitalize on the internet consumption trends we are seeing. One of the most important metrics we monitor is the magnitude of data traffic flowing across our network, and, again, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter with broadband only households consuming over 700 GB of data each month. Our customers continue to take faster speeds with around 70% of our residential subscribers receiving speeds of 500 Mbps or higher, and 1/3 getting a gigabit or more.\nThese positive consumer trends play to our strengths and will only accelerate with the shift of live sports to streaming, which together with entertainment on streaming accounts for nearly 70% of our network traffic today. My final thought on broadband is the importance of bundling with mobile. With 90% of Xfinity Mobile smartphone traffic traveling over our Wi-Fi network, these two products work seamlessly together to benefit our customers from both the products experience and financial value standpoint. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw in wireless this quarter, where our line additions were again above 300,000 and nicely up year over year.\nOur new converged offers resulted in better overall yield and awareness, as well as higher multi-line attach rates, and we are excited for some of the new mobile offers tied to the Olympics, which will be introduced to the market in just a few days. Now let's turn to parks, where our results were down in both revenue and EBITDA when compared to last year's record performance, with 2/3 of the decline driven by lower attendance at our domestic parks. We attribute this to a number of factors. First is what now appears to be a Covid recovery pull forward of a magnitude we hadn't previously appreciated. I think it's important to zoom out and look at how this business has trended over the past few years, going back to 2022 and 2023.\nParks were clearly the early beneficiaries of substantial rebounds in tourism and travel after the pandemic, resulting in a surge in demand that contributed to us reaching record results for both of those years.\nMore recently, other travel options, including cruises and international tourism, given the strength of the dollar, have experienced their own surge in demand which caused visitation rates at our parks to normalize. The second factor affecting attendance at our domestic parks is the timing of our investments in new attractions where we are light in Florida in advance of next year's opening of Epic Universe and our lapping of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood is creating some headwinds for us as well. While the parks results are below our original expectations for the year, we still view parks as a terrific long term growth business for us. We couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe in 2025 as we've been releasing new details about Epic Universe's five immersive worlds.\nThe consumer reaction has been tremendous, and recently we opened an Epic Universe Preview Center in Orlando, and the foot traffic and guest enthusiasm have been off the charts. So we look forward to Epic Universe having a meaningful impact by driving incremental attendance, longer visits, and higher per-cap spending once the park opens in 2025. Finally, let me talk about the NBA. Our expectation is that soon an 11-year rights deal between ourselves and the NBA will be announced. We don't believe that the resolution of matching rights will affect the package that we expect to be awarded. This package, which begins with the 2025-2026 season, includes 100 NBA games each regular season across NBC and Peacock, which is more than any other media partner and more regular season games than each existing partner has under the current rights deal.\nFor playoffs, we will have first and second round games each year exclusively on our national platforms and six NBA Conference Final series over the course of the term of the deal, which is more playoff games on average each year than any other media partner, and exclusively for Peacock, will be approximately 50 national regular season and post season games including national Monday Night Games and doubleheaders. Additional elements of the NBA package include the annual NBA All-Star Game and All-Star Saturday Night each season, the season-opening NBA Tip-Off Doubleheader each season, a special doubleheader on the MLK Holiday and select NBA games, and every NBA All-Star Game on Telemundo.\nBeyond the NBA itself, we're excited that our package includes WNBA where starting in the spring of 2026, we'll have more than 50 WNBA regular season and first-round playoff games each season across Peacock, NBC, and USA, and we'll also have games in seven WNBA conference semifinals and three WNBA final series. For USA Basketball, we'll have the rights to USA Men's and Women's games leading up to the Olympics and FIBA World Cup. Sky Sports will air all of NBCUniversal's NBA and WNBA games in its markets, and finally, Xfinity will be the NBA and WNBA's marketing partner in the video category. Now I'd like to take a moment to explain why we're so excited to partner with the NBA. First, it brings in a broad, diverse, and youthful audience that is culturally relevant and further expands NBCUniversal's tremendous reach across broadcast and streaming.\nThis new fan base will also allow us to create new entertainment content that will work beyond the basketball season with exciting opportunities for companion programming and marketing collaborations that tap into the NBA's pop culture appeal.\nSecond, the nine-month basketball season completes our year-round calendar for sports which already includes the NFL, Olympics, Premier League, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Big Ten, and World Cup. Our NBA package will establish much-watched Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday night traditions on NBC and Peacock. Third, we are uniquely able to drive strong value with the NBA in multiple ways. First, by growing ad sales by selling NBA ad inventory packaged with the rest of our marquee programming; second, by acquiring and monetizing subscribers both on linear and Peacock; and third, by optimizing NBCUniversal programming investment across sports, entertainment, and news. The NBA's decision to partner with us is a testament to our breadth and reach, our operational excellence in sports and innovation, and our decades of experience delivering world-class content to consumers.\nMuch like our long-standing relationships with the NFL and the Olympics, we look forward to putting the weight of our entire company behind our partnership with the NBA for decades to come. Before I hand it over to Jason, I want to share one final thought. In just a few short days we have the honor of kicking off the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. This will be NBCUniversal's 18th Olympic Games as a US broadcaster dating back to 1936 when we first covered the historic event on NBC Radio. It is one of the great moments of pride for our company, and I want to thank the 3,000 people working to bring all of the action, excitement, and incredible stories to our viewers across the country. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Mike and good morning everybody. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 3. Total revenue decreased 2.7% to $29.7 billion. Within these results, our six major growth drivers including residential broadband, wireless business services, connectivity, theme parks, streaming, and premium content at our studios generated over $16 billion in revenue, well over half of our total company revenue, and grew at a mid single digit rate over the past 12 months. Keep in mind that in Q2 last year we had one of our most successful quarterly theatrical results in our history which included two of 2023's top five grossing films at the worldwide box office, the Super Mario Bros. Movie and Fast X, and as such created a difficult comparison. This quarter, if we exclude our studio results, total revenue would have been consistent with the prior year.\nTotal EBITDA was consistent at $10.2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Free cash flow was impacted this quarter by higher than usual cash taxes, which were up $2 billion over last year's level and were impacted by a tax payment associated with our Hulu stake and other tax related matters. As you'll recall, we received a minimum floor payment for Hulu at the end of last year. During the second quarter, we returned $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.2 billion in share repurchases, and over the last 12 months we have reduced our share count by over 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth of 7%. Now let's go through our business results starting on slide 4 with connectivity and platforms, as usual. I will refer to our year over year growth on a constant currency basis.\nRevenue for total connectivity and platforms was consistent at $20.2 billion as strong growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video and voice revenue. Residential connectivity revenue grew 6% comprised of 3% growth in domestic broadband, 17% growth in domestic wireless, and 14% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue also grew 6% in domestic broadband. Our revenue growth was again driven by strong ARPU growth which increased 3.6% this quarter, well within our historical range. As our team continues to effectively balance rate and volume through customer segmentation, the environment for broadband subscribers remains intensely competitive, which when combined with traditional negative seasonality in Q2 led to 120,000 subscriber losses.\nRelated to this, I would like to spend a minute on ACP. It has been well documented that the government ended all funding for the ACP program in June, consistent with our approach to normal promotional rolloffs. We were proactive and prepared for this action early in the quarter, communicating with our ACP customer base and migrating many of these customers to different products and price levels. While this had a bit of an impact on ARPU in the quarter, we still feel very comfortable that we will remain well within our historical 3% to 4% ARPU growth range for the remainder of the year. In terms of subscribers, we saw minimal impact from the end of ACP this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the bulk of our ACP-related subscriber activity to happen in Q3, including losses associated with nonpay churn.\nWhile it's too early to assess the full impact, we are encouraged with the response we see from these customers to date. Outside of ACP, we are seeing the same level of competitive intensity and expect an offset from seasonal tailwinds as Q3 is typically a seasonally stronger quarter compared to Q2.\nTurning to domestic wireless, revenue growth was mainly driven by service revenue with some modest growth in equipment revenue this quarter as well. Customer lines increased 20% year over year, reaching 7.2 million in total, including 322,000 line additions this quarter. The acceleration in line additions compared to the prior several quarters was driven by some early success with new pricing plans launched in April targeted at multi-line customers, as well as continued traction with our buy one get one line offer, and you will see us continue to test new ways to capitalize on the significant opportunities we see ahead for us in wireless in terms of both increasing the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 12%, as well as selling additional lines per account.\nWireless continues to be a key growth area for us and one in which we are striking the right balance in delivering exceptional value to our customers, bundling to enhance our opportunities in broadband, and continuing to drive profitability. Higher international connectivity revenue was mainly driven by broadband, which accounts for over 2/3 of our international revenue and grew at a mid-teens rate reflecting strong ARPU growth. The remainder is wireless, which grew due to both additional lines and ARPU growth but at a lower rate due to the variability in handset sales. Business services connectivity revenue growth of 6% reflects steady growth in small business with even faster growth in mid-market and enterprise.\nWhile the SMB market remains competitive, we are competing aggressively by delivering best-in-class products and services and growing revenue through ARPU growth driven by higher adoption of additional products that expand our relationship with our SMB customers like Mobile Security, Edge Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro as well as through targeted rate opportunities at the mid-market and enterprise level. Our revenue growth is primarily fueled by the increase in our customers driven by the investments we have made in this space to build sales and fulfillment as well as expanding our capabilities in managed services, wide area networking, and cybersecurity. Finally, video and other revenue declined in the quarter.\nThe high single-digit decline in our video revenue is a function of continued customer losses coupled with slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower other revenue mainly reflects the continued customer losses in wireline voice. Connectivity and Platforms' total EBITDA increased 1.6%, with margin up 90 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the continued mix shift to our higher margin connectivity businesses coupled with ongoing expense management. As I have previously mentioned in prior quarters, and think is worth noting here, is that the only expense line item that had a meaningful increase over last year was direct product costs, which are success based and tied to growth in our connectivity businesses. Breaking out our Connectivity and Platforms.\nEBITDA Results. Further, residential EBITDA increased 1.1%, with margins improving 100 basis points to 39.9%, and business services EBITDA growth rebounded nicely this quarter, returning to a mid-single-digit rate, while margin declined 70 basis points to 57%, reflecting the investments in sales and fulfillment we are making to scale in the mid-market and enterprise space. Now let's turn to content and experiences on slide 5. Revenue decreased 7.5% to $10.1 billion, and EBITDA decreased 11% to $1.9 billion. I'll detail these results further, starting with theme parks. Revenue decreased 11%, and EBITDA declined 24% in the quarter compared to last year's record level for a second quarter. As Mike highlighted, 2/3 of the decline was driven by our domestic parks due to lower attendance compared to last year, largely reflecting two factors: normalization in demand post-COVID combined with the timing of our domestic attractions.\nThis is the first full quarter comparison to the highly successful opening of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood early last year, which drove that park's record results in the second quarter of last year. We haven't launched a major new attraction in Orlando since VelociCoaster in 2021 in anticipation of Epic Universe, which we originally planned to open this year. On the international side, underlying growth at our park in Osaka continues, partially offset by foreign currency, as well as some softness at Universal Beijing due to the local macroeconomic environment. To reiterate, we couldn't be more bullish about the long-term trajectory of parks. In addition to Epic Universe, we have a fantastic slate of new attractions and experiences on the horizon.\nDonkey Kong Country in Osaka and a Fast & Furious roller coaster in Hollywood, as well as the Universal Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas and our Universal Kids Resort coming to Texas. Now let's turn to Media, where revenue increased 2% and EBITDA was up 9% driven by Peacock. Peacock revenue grew 28% with 9% growth in advertising and 61% growth in distribution driven by the 38% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 33 million. On a sequential basis, we held subscribers fairly steady. As we noted during our last earnings call. Our focus in the second quarter was on subscriber retention due to the lack of new tentpole content in the quarter.\nThis timing and content also contributed to some relief in our expenses, which helped drive year-over-year Peacock EBITDA improvement of $300 million. We are pleased with the progress we are making with media EBITDA for the first half of the year, up nearly 3%, as the improvement at Peacock outweighed the pressure at our TV networks. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect continued modest growth in overall media EBITDA, but with some variation in the degree of year-over-year improvement between the quarters, driven by the timing of sports entertainment launches and marketing. Beginning in the third quarter, we are loaded with incremental content, including the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, which will have an additional game fall into the third quarter, as well as Peacock's exclusive NFL game from Brazil, and the return of Big Ten.\nGiven the timing of this content, EBITDA growth will be skewed to the fourth quarter. At Studios, revenue decreased 27% and EBITDA decreased 51%, reflecting both the timing of our film slate and a tough comparison relative to last year's second quarter, which included the tremendously successful Super Mario Bros. Movie as well as Fast X. We have said our film slate is weighted to the back half of the year, which we believe will drive better year over year performance and we're off to a strong start. Despicable Me 4 had a terrific opening weekend earlier this month, making the Despicable Me series of movies the first animated franchise in history to cross the $5 billion mark. Twisters is off to a strong start, landing at number one at the box office this past weekend.\nAnd we're excited about our upcoming titles including Wild Robot in September and Wicked in November. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which includes a $2 billion increase in cash taxes over last year's level. Total capital spending declined 10% compared to last year, with the $3.4 billion in spending, reflecting the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers, such as expanding our footprint, further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business, and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe theme park ahead of its opening in 2025. Turning to return of capital for the quarter, we returned a total of $3.4 billion to shareholders. This includes share repurchases of $2.2 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion.\nNotably, since we restarted our buyback program just three years ago, we have reduced our share count by 16% and returned just under $50 billion to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends, prudently balancing investments we've made in the business around our six core growth drivers, protecting a strong balance sheet, and providing strong capital returns to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nBrian, thanks. And just to tie everything together, what Mike and Jason have just said, and as our results continue to show, I really believe we are dealing with the competitive landscape shifts exceptionally well. And that's because we have a great team across the company that knows how to execute and innovate. We have the scale, balance sheet, and relevancy to compete with anyone. So if you think about what we're doing to position ourselves for growth, we've expanded our broadband network by 1.2 million new homes passed in the last 12 months, the most in the company's history, and we plan to continue to do that. We're upbeat about the long term in parks despite this quarter and are about to finish building the biggest, most technologically advanced theme park to hit the US market in decades with Epic Universe next year.\nAs you've seen recently, instead of engaging in a process to buy content companies, we have focused primarily on organic opportunities like the NBA, one of the most coveted sports franchises across the globe, which will help drive growth for us well into the future. With that, let's hand it over to Marci to take your questions.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press Star and the number one on your touchtone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press Star and the number two. If you are using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up your handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, please press Star then the number one on your touchtone phone. Our first question today is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning. And Mike, thanks for all the detail on the NBA contract. Appreciate that. I wanted to ask about parks and broadband. Maybe, Jason, on broadband, you made some comments about ACP and how Dave and the team are managing. It seems like it's going well. It seemed like you were implying third quarter losses might be down from Q2. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you talked about an offset around seasonality. I just wondered if maybe you could revisit that and a little bit about how you guys are managing it from a product and marketing point of view in the third quarter. And presumably that's the end. We can move on beyond Q3. We can put ACP behind this. So I wanted to ask about that. And then on Parks, thank you for all the color.\nWhen you guys look at your pacing data, which I imagine got months ahead of you that you can see, is there any, do you see any turn or should we be thinking about year on year pressure on this segment moving at least through the end of the year and into next year as we get ready for Epic. Any more color on sort of what the outlook looks like would be appreciated. Thanks so much.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey Ben, this is Dave. I'm going to jump in a little bit on the ACP part first. So on, I think it's important to just cover a little bit of context, and then we'll get to the outlook and view of Q3. You know, most of the enrolled ACP customers, as we said before, have been with us, and they're on a postpaid basis. So, I think that's an important thing to remember. And our strategy has been consistent. We've been looking to help the ACP customers stay connected through a variety of options, starting with Internet Essentials. And since 2011, we've connected millions in the largest, most comprehensive private sector Internet adoption program in the country. The good news is that our ACP customers are eligible to switch to the Internet Essentials tiers that we have, and we have a couple.\nIn addition, we have Xfinity Mobile and we have good offers through this transition.\nTo help them save money on their monthly bills. The Internet Essentials customer, the plus tier customers could take a free line of Xfinity Mobile for a year, and ACP customers who add Xfinity Mobile can get an additional free unlimited line for a year. So and then we just started with NOW Internet, NOW Mobile, and so nothing material on that, but I think it puts us in good position as we complete the transition. We spent, as Jason said, we've spent a lot of time thinking about this, been very proactive, prepared for this, and in many ways it's similar to the promotional roll activity that we've managed for decades. So we're used to that on the, you know, from a subscriber viewpoint. Also, as Jason said, we saw a minimal impact in ACP in Q2.\nLooking forward, we expect the bulk of the ACP subscriber-related activity to happen in Q3, including losses associated with non-pay churn, very focused on retention. It's early, but the biggest impact I think we're going to see will be on the non-pay side, and as we're just getting into the beginning of the non-pay cycles, encouragingly we're not seeing much voluntary churn in this group. So our goal we'd like to get through the ACP impact as quickly as possible, and right now we're planning to take a reserve on incremental non-pay activity in Q3. But again it is too early to quantify, and we just won't know until we're further through the cycle. So we have a normal disconnect process that we've managed for a long period of time. And again this is the postpaid universe that we have managed through.\nSo that is our view. I think it will be primarily within Q3, but encouraged by at least the voluntary churn aspect. Jason.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYes, I think Dave said it perfectly.\nAs you think about third quarter, Ben, I think unpacking it, and similar to what we saw in the second quarter, the competitive environment remains intense, but it's stable. It's sort of no worse, no better than we've seen over the past couple of quarters. So I think that's the starting point. Second, as we pointed out, it's a quarter where we do get seasonal tailwinds. The same things that were headwinds in the second quarter largely become tailwinds in the third quarter. And then there's ACP that works against that where we will see an impact. As Dave said, the intention is to be largely through the impact by the end of the third quarter between actions we've seen and then a reserve we will take. And so that's the thing we have to make sure we're executing very well against.\nBut as Dave said, the early trends on that, whether it's voluntary churn or trends we've seen so far in non-pay and building non-pay and reserves around that, are encouraging.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nAnd then, Ben, it's Mike on parks. So, to hit on that again and appreciate the question. I think we covered a lot in the earlier remarks, but I'll start where Brian last finished, which is we couldn't be more excited about and confident in the long-term trajectory of the parks business. Particularly as we look ahead to next year with Epic Universe, which is truly looking truly unbelievable. And then other attractions coming. Hollywood's going to get a coaster and Donkey Kong Country in Osaka in the latter part of this year. Timing TBD on both of those. But in the near term, I think the domestic attendance challenge that was what drove 2/3 of the poor comparison.\nThe factors causing that, which is really the COVID pull forward that we talked about, and the timing of attractions, particularly in Hollywood lapping Super Nintendo and in Florida, the fact that we originally planned to have Epic opened this year, but with COVID pushed it back and so have a lull in the action. We haven't started a new big attraction since VelociCoaster in 2021. So as a result of that, I think the factors, even though we're excited about Hollywood Horror Nights in the second half of the year and a little bit of moving past the lapping, I think the trends that we are experiencing likely continue until we get to Epic opening up sometime next year.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett. From MoffettNathanson, your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi.\nThank you.\nGood morning. A little bit more on ACP, if I could. Mike, could you just give us any early insight you've got on the delinquency rate for people that are 30 days or 60 days past due, just so we can sort of get a sense of what non pays may look like? And then presumably there was some impact, certainly there was in the first quarter of just lower gross adds in the category because new enrollments were shut off.\nSomebody moving across the street, for example, would lose it at their old address but not be able to get it at their new one. Do you have any estimate for how much ACP impact there might have been?\nIn the gross ad category? And then just one. Just simple housekeeping question. You typically report cable margins on the conference call in the script. I didn't hear it. Maybe I missed it. But I'm wondering if you could tell us what cable margins were in the quarter.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nI'll let Dave handle the ACP question. Craig, it's Mike.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Craig. Dave. So in terms of delinquency rates, there's nothing, you know, watching. It's just we have a normal process that we manage through, you know, based on due dates, invoices, and it goes, you know, anywhere from two to three months. There's nothing at this point to report on. At this stage, we watch it closely other than to go back to what I said, been very proactive. And I think we're helped by experience in promotional roles and the fact that we tried to put customers into packages that made sense for them proactively. So there's a lot of work that went into that ahead of time, but nothing at this stage. And we'll give more as we go.\nIn terms of the question, in terms of lower gross adds, impacts on connects, it was not material that we saw in Q2, so maybe just a little bit in terms of things that we said, but it wasn't a substantial impact in Q2. We think the bulk of what we're seeing is really going to be on the non-pay side, which will occur in Q3.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nCraig, let me hit the margin question real quick. So I would say the way we're looking at the business is really across connectivity and platforms. So looking at it that way and managing the business that way. But to unpack it, legacy cable margin, if you wanted to look at it that way, the margin was up 100, 110 basis points in the quarter. So really strong operating improvement to 48.4%.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay, thanks. Could I squeeze in one more, and just your thinking is right now about BEAD and whether we might see more capital investment on the BEAD side?\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYeah, this is Dave. BEAD. We're looking at it very closely. It is going to be worked out on a state by state basis. We're optimistic in a lot of cases, but we'll have to look for the guidelines and the specifics tied to it. Nothing at this point would suggest we're going to be beyond the capital intensity that we've already given out. I think with all we're optimistic. One of the points that Brian mentioned, 1.2 million that we've done in the last 12 months is astounding. And the machine is really going, so we're leaning in going for it. But BEAD will be in a state by state basis.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator, we are now ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nSenior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. I have an MBA question and also one on advertising.\nThe benefits, as you outlined, are pretty obvious of getting the NBA, but it does come at a significant price. I was hoping you could walk us through how you expect to make a positive financial return and maybe elaborate a little more on what role Peacock will play since there's a clear benefit there. But how does it affect, you know, how does this new deal impact programming spend for other areas, including general entertainment? And then as part of Peacock, maybe you could talk about like the StreamSaver, the bundle with Netflix and Apple TV, and the response you've had. And then on advertising, the upfront is now done. Maybe you can talk about a little bit about the unique selling position you've had relative to others and what the volume is, overall pricing, et cetera, just what you're seeing in the overall market.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSure.\nHey Jessica, it's Mike. So I think I've essentially covered everything that I wanted to cover and can cover at this stage on NBA in the prepared remarks. Obviously, when the NBA makes its ultimate announcements.\nThat'll be another moment where we can go deeper. But just to point generally, is that we are looking at the NBA, as we all said, as some of the premier content that is culturally relevant, excellent audience, widens out the calendar year for us across Peacock and NBC, can do a lot with the demographics that follow the NBA around other programming. So when you think about the business case for it, when you look at the long term and as we are managing the media business, broadcast and Peacock, you know, as one, I think the unique reach that we have and ability for a sport like the NBA to reach so far with our existing broadcast business and use, as I said earlier, plenty of exclusive games for Peacock to drive excellent acquisition in Peacock.\nWe've talked about before using NBA, and as we've talked about before, sports has been a great source of acquisition for us in Peacock and a great source of value to the consumer. But what's very interesting to us is how significant the viewership is of sports viewers on Peacock, of things other than sports. So when you take a zoom out and think about the total picture of what we're trying to do, which is to bring our excellent TV media assets into the future, I think you can, you know, we view the NBA as an excellent piece in that puzzle, and it will allow us to rebalance programming from, you know, from other areas.\nObviously we'll fill a few nights, you know, on NBC with this content versus other content and we'll, you know, use this to do acquisition spend in Peacock and lighten up in some other places. But the long-term goal for Peacock is to have a service that is a balance of sports, entertainment, and news. And so our content teams are now very focused on that new audience and what we're going to be able to do to drive entertainment content with the advantage of being linked closely to the NBA and to the audience that follows it.\nThen on advertising. Q2, pretty, you know, only a slight step down from Q1, but clearly we had a much heavier load of sports in Q1 than Q2. And so that, you know, adjusting for that, I'd say again that the advertising market remains pretty stable. We feel very well positioned for H2 with the Olympics coming up, you know, starting this Friday, elections, and a great slate of content coming to NBC and Peacock. In terms of the upfront, we're pleased with our results. Total volume for us is going to be basically in line, you know, with last year, as is Linear price. We got well over $1 billion in upfront volume for Peacock again, which and nice growth over what we had last year.\nSo if you step back, we'd say the overall upfront market was pretty solid. We moved quickly given our strength of our assets to secure the volume that we got. So we feel we were a success in this more challenging upfront given the arrival of so many of the new players, especially in the AVOD Netflix space. So that's the report on the upfronts, but we're moving forward and feel like the team did quite a good job.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe on the cable side a little bit better trends in both video and wireless. On the video side, what's driving the improvement there? Do you expect it to continue, and are you seeing any effects of the launch of the NOW brand, and then in wireless? You guys talked about some new pricing and promotion, but do you guys think you're benefiting at all from some of the ACP losses on the prepaid side? I don't know if you guys saw yesterday; Verizon announced they sort of turned off 400,000 subscribers. I think we'll see something similar with the rest of the wireless companies. But do you think this underlying growth is sustainable, or do you think that ACP is somehow boosting the growth at this point? Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey John, Dave. So terms of video.\nAs Jason said.\nOur video losses are lower than the ones last year. This time. We did take a slightly less.\nRate increase.\nThis year than last year, and the key for us in video is just positioning video with broadband, and that video does help in that regard. We've seen positive churn in terms of video, reimagining video around the NOW TV product and IP, and that has been steady. It's still early, but has been helpful. So video, I think, for the right segment we offer a lot of value, and we continue to position it, I think, very well with broadband, but difficult and still in terms of some of the fees and things that we have, but I think an important category for us. So in terms of the mobile side, NOW Mobile is not material at this point, way too early. The acceleration in line adds over Q1, driven by the early success of the new pricing plans.\nIt's really competitive now in multi-line pricing, launched in April, targeted it for a while. Now it's scaling, and it's really gotten traction as well as the buy one, get one line offer to our base. So wireless is such an important part of our overall strategy and key that it's 12% penetration. We got great runway ahead. Business mobile is just getting going, and it's a great position for us in terms of convergence. I think we're uniquely positioned in terms of ubiquitous offers across our entire footprint, and mobile will be front and center as we approach the Olympics, and we will have a great offer with broadband, with mobile being able to tie all this together. So very excited with it.\nThe comment, just one other part in terms of what happened in terms of Verizon's unpacking, that the only thing I'll say is I think it's an important distinction that our ACP customers are postpaid versus their prepaid. It's a different group, a different dynamic, and so not really. We're just getting going on our NOW products, and so it's very, very early on. Excited about that, and I think we're introducing it at a very good moment, but it's not material at this stage.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, John. Operator. We're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks guys. I guess for Jason, two quick ones on content costs in the connectivity business. They came in quite a bit lower than we expected, and I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on what's driving the trend there and how sustainable it is. We're trending a little bit lower than guidance on CapEx so far this year. I'm wondering if that's just tightly related, if it picks up in the back half of the year. Mike, I'm not sure if I heard you loud and clear on having sort of said what you can on the NBA deal. I'm wondering if you can just give us a little bit of context around the timing of costs and revenues, though, when I recognize it's forward-looking.\nWhen should we expect to see the cost from the new contract start to hit? Thank you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Jonathan.\nWhy don't I start with CapEx? Daval had content costs, and then Mike with NBA. So on CapEx, you're right. We've had some variability this year, I would say, you know, relative to the initial guidance we gave both on the content and experience side, where we talked about, you know, this is the final significant year of Epic spending, and then we get relief beyond this. And then on the connectivity and platform side, which I think is probably where more your question was, we gave a capital intensity envelope as we entered the year. We also said, you know, intend to do 1.1 million plus in terms of homes passed. We're obviously trending a little bit above that at this point, but still feel comfortable with the capital intensity envelope that we gave. And so there are some timing aspects around equipment purchases within the year.\nI would say still feel comfortable with the existing capital intensity envelope and within that doing more and more homes passed at a really efficient rate. You know, I think that's a, that's a testament to how the team's executing here.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, John. Jonathan. Dave. So just on the content cost side of things. So that's also timing related.\nWe.\nThey're in the sports side, a well-known thing in terms of RSNs, but there are other timing-related things. Every contract with a programming partner is different, every relationship is different. So we won't go into the specifics, but it is key that we focus on, for us, flexibility, increasing market choice. We segment the marketplace, both video and broadband, and together, and that is important that we're competitive in every segment. And at the end of the day, we're focusing on value, combining linear, streaming considerations on a case-by-case basis. But mostly, at this point, it was timing-related.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nAnd Jonathan, it's Mike on NBA. I wish it were sooner, but the contract doesn't start until the 2025, 2026 season. So it's fall of 2025. We would start to bear the expense of the rights. And obviously that is also as we build into that when we would begin to see the benefits of subscriber acquisition around the NBA.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThis is Brian just want to just close out, perhaps, that Mike's opening comments on the NBA.\nYou know, doesn't opportunities like this come along very rarely when there's long-term relationships up for grabs inside, and we'll have, when it gets all announced, the detail that Mike described. We have probably more content than anybody, and it's all, I think, at a value that we'll be able to, as one of the other questions asked, support and demonstrate. One of our real advantages here is the way we're running the media business. Mike created one group with our existing assets like NBC and our growing asset like Peacock. Putting that together is very appealing for the reach, for the consumer access, for the innovation that we'll have in the years ahead. You'll see some of that innovation during the Olympics. There'll be a lot of content on NBC, but way more content on Peacock.\nIt allows for the trends that we're seeing in viewing behavior, so it's a very exciting moment, and I think we'll have more to say in the weeks ahead.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Line is now live.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you for the question. I just have two, one on business services and one on wireless. First on business services, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the key initiatives or things that might be changing at Comcast Business following Ed's appointment as president to more aggressively pursue the mid market or enterprise. What are you seeing in terms of the competitive side within SMB? Is it just fixed wireless or is there more to that? And then on wireless, given the strong potential upgrade cycle on the back of AI, smartphones, and the iPhone 16, I was just wondering if you talk about the Xfinity Mobile strategy to capitalize this on this from a promotional marketing perspective.\nYou know, what levers are you planning to pull this holiday to potentially lean into wireless to help the broader business and wireless at large? Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable",
    "content2": "Got it. Thank you. This is Dave. So a couple of things. Let me start with business.\nAs you said, it is competitive in the small business categories, competitive in every category, but in particular the small business one. There certainly is some fixed wireless that we've seen, saw it in the Verizon results, pretty high percentage of the fixed wireless that are in the small business thing. We're, we look at that closely. We are intensely focused on our competitive playbooks, and we're going to constantly compete for share. But we're also focused on revenue per relationship. So in the small business area, before getting into mid market, we're doing a lot of product upgrades, adding value and speed, WiFi security, and so made good progress and revenue focus around in small business. It's such a huge opportunity for us still in terms of small business. Ed has stepped right in.\nIt's a terrific team in the business services group that he's working with. There really is, I think, a unique opportunity when you look at the overall addressable market, which is $60 billion or less than 20% there. A huge chunk of this will be mid market and enterprise. You add on top of that international opportunities that we're beginning to coordinate and work well with Dana and the team at Sky. So we really are seeing nice relationship growth in mid market and enterprise. That's the starting point. But in addition to like all of our strategies, we're adding more products and attaching new products on these relationships and going beyond just connectivity into a full managed relationship basis.\nSo ED is driving that, and we're in a good competitive position for growth, and I think we have a good ability to increase ARPU across an increasing higher end base of customers. So on the mobile side of upgrade, it is every single upgrade moment; pay close attention to that one too. And we're optimistic; we're in good position. We have a great trade in program for mobile that we've had in place now for a while. And then, in addition to that, we go in and out in terms of subsidies on top of that trade in program. And then when good upgrade moments happen, we are the switching provider. So when people, we have great core rates, and we have good handset offers and good position for it.\nSo being a switching provider, I think we are, I think, in a unique position to really take advantage of that. And when you look at things going into the optimism for Q3, one of the most important programs that we'll do, along with the handset upgrade initiative on.\nMobile will be the Olympics.\nThe Olympics are such a unique opportunity for us to showcase the best broadband, the best mobile service offering. Combining those two things together in such an attractive offer, on top of that is the greatest UI in the marketplace that helps you find whatever you want. So really excited about that. Look for that in the next couple of days. But mobile will be front and center along with broadband when that happens.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike.\nOperator: We have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our final question today is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThanks. So with mid-splits now reaching over 40% of the footprint, I was just wondering if you have an updated outlook on when you think you'll be at DOCSIS 4.0 for most of your broadband passings. And maybe within this you could just update us on where fiber overlap is. But also as you get through this network investment architecture that you laid out earlier this year, when you think about the capital intensity and capex coming down and we'll start to see that benefit in growing free cash flow. So timing on that I think would be really interesting. And then how are you thinking about getting to just break even on Peacock? You talked about media EBITDA on a total basis growing in the first half and in the second half too.\nIt seems like if the Peacock losses keep getting better at this pace, you could be close to break even this time next year. But I know you've got NBA coming, so just wondering if we could think about that benchmark quite yet? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey Stephen, this is Dave. Let me start and then hand it over on the CTO side. So we're 42% mid-split right now. We expect to be 50% by year end. And the DOCSIS 4.0 that follows multiple markets so far. So it's early, no specifics in terms of the final rollout on that, but it really is tracking very well. On top of.\nA lot of new footprint expansions, the 1.2 million over the last 12 months, this upgrade program is moving along very well, and it tracks to where the customers are and our steady focus around the higher end. You know, one of the things that we see, you know, we have the most effective and efficient build that's ubiquitous, that is addressing speed, capacity, coverage, and it helps us because as we're doing this, remember we're virtualizing huge parts of the network and avoiding future node splits. So it's very efficient in helping us. You know, with the 70% of our customers are 500 megabits or higher, 1/3 are taking a gig, and it's tracking to maybe one of the biggest tailwinds that is out there. That's the fact that our network consumption is still low, double digits increasing, and that's not stopping.\nSo we're putting ourselves in position with a great upgrade program. And so that, you know, to me is, you know, I think a great advantage that we do have in terms of competition. In terms of fiber, we're now 50% in terms of the overbuilt. We expect by the end of 2025 that'll get to 60% will probably go higher than that. We have a long track record of competing against fiber, 20 years at this point. So we do think fiber is quite frankly the longer term competitor keeping our eye on, compete fiercely against fixed wireless and every competitor. But we anticipate where they're building, what they're doing, and keeping track of all of that. So, like, our results and encouraged.\nYou know, when you look going into Q3, one of the reasons of optimism is that voluntary, you know, churn that continues to perform very well. I think it's our superior network combined with better products and extreme focus on competition.\nStephen, I would just round that out on the capital intensity question because I think embedded in that was sort of a long-term capital intensity question. If you look at what we're doing now, you know, the path towards mid-splits, which as Dave mentioned, really good progress there, that kicking off DOCSIS 4.0 and then adding 1.2 million homes passed, which is a record for us in the last 12 months and doing that all within, through the existing capital intensity envelope, which is one of if not the lowest in the industry. So very good progress there as you think about longer-term. A lot of people ask this question in the context of is there the next big thing coming in terms of the network upgrade? We feel very comfortable between mid-splits and DOCSIS 4.0, that leading to multi-gig symmetrical speeds.\nThat is the network for the future. So we don't see the next big thing coming. The one area that I'd point out we'd love to do more Homes Passed, you know, we've accelerated the rate from 800,000 in the past couple of years up to currently 1.2 million. We won't gate capital intensity because of that. If those are good returns and things we should be doing, we'd love to do more there.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nStephen, on Peacock and media EBITDA, I think you heard us right. Anyway, heard me right. I've been talking since I've been doing this that I don't really look at Peacock standalone. I mean, it's an interesting exercise, and I'm happy to share the numbers of what the, you know, the, the losses on Peacock as we're building it. But strategically, to not pursue that path would leave the existing media business on a downward trend. So, I think we are thinking about it over multiple years. I'm very confident that what we're doing around Peacock and the media business together, operating together, is going to put us on a path to optimize that business. And as you said, I think this is a year where we see the growth in Peacock offsetting the decline in some of our linear businesses.\nThat's basically a trend I would expect to see carried forward. There's going to be ebbs and flows as Brian said.\nSomething like NBA is once in a generation, almost, to get an opportunity like that. So obviously we'll make some adjustments, and it might pause our trajectory of the year we take it. But I think it's part and parcel of the idea that we're bringing the media business to a better future by investing behind Peacock and doing it together with all our assets, entertainment, sports, and news as what our media business will look to be in the future. Well, thank you everybody. I think that's it. I stole Marci's line. Go ahead.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. This concludes our Q2 earnings call. Thanks for joining us.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude today's question and answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our investor relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before I hand it over to Jason, I'd like to comment on three key elements from the quarter. One, broadband; two, parks; and three, the NBA. First is broadband, where the competitive intensity that we've seen for the past several quarters, and which is particularly felt in the market for price-conscious consumers, remains essentially unchanged. Throughout this period, our broadband strategy has been consistent, and we remain confident in our plan. We are focused on generating healthy broadband revenue growth by striking the right balance between rate and volume, and relying heavily on market segmentation that I'll speak to in a minute. As a result, in Q2, ARPU grew 3.6%, which was within our historical range of 3 to 4%.\nDespite the competitiveness of the recent past, we've maintained a market-leading base of 32 million broadband customers by refining our go-to-market approach to create options that fit each of our customers' lifestyles and budgets. Providing the best products with flexibility and choice at different value points has served us extremely well for many years and remains the core of our playbook. Of particular note, this quarter we launched our suite of NOW products, which are high-quality internet, mobile, and streaming TV offerings designed to be incredibly simple with attractive all-in pricing with no contracts or credit checks. These are great options for the price-conscious segment and especially for those impacted by the end of the government's ACP program.\nWhile we are pleased with our enhancement to our offerings for the price-conscious segment, the reality is that the vast majority of our customer base subscribes to more premium products where we feel great about our market position relative to fiber, which is our true long-term competitor. We are investing in additional network capacity, multi-gig speeds, and in-home WiFi technology to capitalize on the internet consumption trends we are seeing. One of the most important metrics we monitor is the magnitude of data traffic flowing across our network, and again we saw double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter with broadband-only households consuming over 700 GB of data each month, and our customers continue to take faster speeds with around 70% of our residential subscribers receiving speeds of 500 Mbps or higher and 1/3 getting a gigabit or more.\nThese positive consumer trends play to our strengths and will only accelerate with the shift of live sports to streaming, which together with entertainment on streaming accounts for nearly 70% of our network traffic today. My final thought on broadband is the importance of bundling with mobile. With 90% of Xfinity mobile smartphone traffic traveling over our Wi-Fi network, these two products work seamlessly together to benefit our customers from both a product experience and financial value standpoint. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw in wireless this quarter where our line additions were again above 300,000 and nicely up year over year.\nOur new converged offers resulted in better overall yield and awareness, as well as higher multi-line attach rates, and we are excited for some of the new mobile offers tied to the Olympics, which will be introduced to the market in just a few days. Now let's turn to parks, where our results were down in both revenue and EBITDA when compared to last year's record performance, with 2/3 of the decline driven by lower attendance at our domestic parks. We attribute this to a number of factors. First is what now appears to be a Covid recovery pull forward of a magnitude we hadn't previously appreciated. I think it's important to zoom out and look at how this business has trended over the past few years, going back to 2022 and 2023.\nParks were clearly the early beneficiaries of substantial rebounds in tourism and travel after the pandemic, resulting in a surge in demand that contributed to us reaching record results for both of those years.\nMore recently, other travel options, including cruises and international tourism, given the strength of the dollar, have experienced their own surge in demand, which caused visitation rates at our parks to normalize. The second factor affecting attendance at our domestic parks is the timing of our investments in new attractions, where we are light in Florida in advance of next year's opening of Epic Universe, and our lapping of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood is creating some headwinds for us as well. While the parks results are below our original expectations for the year, we still view parks as a terrific long-term growth business for us. We couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe in 2025 as we've been releasing new details about Epic's five immersive worlds. The consumer reaction has been tremendous.\nAnd recently we opened an Epic Universe Preview center in Orlando, and the foot traffic and guest enthusiasm have been off the charts. So we look forward to Epic Universe having a meaningful impact by driving incremental attendance, longer visits, and higher per cap spending once the park opens in 2025. Finally, let me talk about the NBA. Our expectation is that soon an 11-year rights deal between ourselves and the NBA will be announced. We don't believe that the resolution of matching rights will affect the package that we expect to be awarded. This package, which begins with the 2025-2026 season, includes 100 NBA games each regular season across NBC and Peacock, which is more than any other media partner and more regular season games than each existing partner has under the current rights deal.\nFor playoffs, we will have first and second round games each year exclusively on our national platforms and six NBA Conference Final series over the course of the term of the deal, which is more playoff games on average each year than any other media partner, and exclusively for Peacock, will be approximately 50 national regular season and postseason games including national Monday Night Games and doubleheaders. Additional elements of the NBA package include the annual NBA All-Star Game and All-Star Saturday Night each season, the Season Opening NBA Tip-Off Doubleheader each season, a special doubleheader on the MLK Holiday, and select NBA games, and every NBA All-Star Game on Telemundo. Beyond the NBA itself, we're excited that our package includes WNBA. We're starting in the spring of 2026.\nWe'll have more than 50 WNBA regular season and first-round playoff games each season across Peacock, NBC, and USA, and we'll also have games in seven WNBA conference semifinals and three WNBA final series. For USA Basketball, we'll have the rights to USA men's and women's games leading up to the Olympics and FIBA World Cup. Sky Sports will air all of NBCUniversal's NBA and WNBA games in its markets. And finally, Xfinity will be the NBA and WNBA's marketing partner in the video category.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to explain why we're so excited to partner with the NBA. First, it brings in a broad, diverse, and youthful audience that is culturally relevant and further expands NBCUniversal's tremendous reach across broadcast and streaming. This new fan base will also allow us to create new entertainment content that will work beyond the basketball season with exciting opportunities for companion programming and marketing collaborations that tap into the NBA's pop culture appeal.\nSecond, the nine-month basketball season completes our year-round calendar for sports which already includes the NFL, Olympics, Premier League, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Big Ten, and World Cup. Our NBA package will establish much-watched Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday night traditions on NBC and Peacock. Third, we are uniquely able to drive strong value with the NBA in multiple ways. First, by growing ad sales, by selling NBA ad inventory packaged with the rest of our marquee programming, second, by acquiring and monetizing subscribers both on Linear and Peacock, and third, by optimizing NBCUniversal programming investment across sports, entertainment, and news. The NBA's decision to partner with us is a testament to our breadth and reach, our operational excellence in sports and innovation, and our decades of experience delivering world-class content to consumers.\nMuch like our long standing relationships with the NFL and the Olympics, we look forward to putting the weight of our entire company behind our partnership with the NBA for decades to come. Before I hand it over to Jason, I want to share one final thought. In just a few short days we have the honor of kicking off the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. This will be NBCUniversal's 18th Olympic Games as a US broadcaster dating back to 1936 when we first covered the historic event on NBC Radio. It is one of the great moments of pride for our company and I want to thank the 3,000 people working to bring all of the action, excitement, and incredible stories to our viewers across the country. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 3. Total revenue decreased 2.7% to $29.7 billion. Within these results, our six major growth drivers, including residential, broadband, wireless, business services, connectivity, theme parks, streaming, and premium content at our Studios, generated over 16 billion in revenue, well over half of our total company revenue, and grew at a mid-single-digit rate over the past 12 months. Keep in mind that in Q2 last year, we had one of our most successful quarterly theatrical results in our history, which included two of 2023's top five grossing films at the worldwide box office, the Super Mario Bros.\nMovie and Fast X and as such created a difficult comparison this quarter. If we exclude our studio results, total revenue would have been consistent with the prior year. Total EBITDA was consistent at $10.2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Free cash flow was impacted this quarter by higher than usual cash taxes, which were up $2 billion over last year's level and were impacted by a tax payment associated with our Hulu stake and other tax-related matters. As you'll recall, we received a minimum floor payment for Hulu at the end of last year. During the second quarter, we returned $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.2 billion in share repurchases, and over the last 12 months we have reduced our share count by over 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth of 7%.\nNow let's go through our business results starting on slide 4 with connectivity and platforms. As usual, I will refer to our year over year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was consistent at $20.2 billion as strong growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video and voice revenue. Residential connectivity revenue grew 6% comprised of 3% growth in domestic broadband, 17% growth in domestic wireless, and 14% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue also grew 6% in domestic broadband. Our revenue growth was again driven by strong ARPU growth which increased 3.6% this quarter, well within our historical range. As our team continues to effectively balance rate and volume through customer segmentation, the environment for broadband subscribers remains intensely competitive, which when combined with traditional negative seasonality in Q2 led to 120,000 subscriber losses.\nRelated to this, I would like to spend a minute on ACP. It has been well documented that the government ended all funding for the ACP program in June, consistent with our approach to normal promotional roll offs. We were proactive and prepared for this action early in the quarter, communicating with our ACP customer base and migrating many of these customers to different products and price levels. While this had a bit of an impact on ARPU in the quarter, we still feel very comfortable that we will remain well within our historical 3% to 4% ARPU growth range for the remainder of the year. In terms of subscribers, we saw minimal impact from the end of ACP this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the bulk of our ACP-related subscriber activity to happen in Q3, including losses associated with non-paid churn.\nWhile it's too early to assess the full impact, we are encouraged with the response we see from these customers to date. Outside of ACP, we are seeing the same level of competitive intensity and expect an offset from seasonal tailwinds as the Q3 is typically a seasonally stronger quarter compared to the Q2.\nTurning to domestic wireless, revenue growth was mainly driven by service revenue with some modest growth in equipment revenue this quarter as well. Customer lines increased 20% year over year, reaching 7.2 million in total, including 322,000 line additions this quarter. The acceleration in line additions compared to the prior several quarters was driven by some early success with new pricing plans launched in April targeted at multi-line customers as well as continued traction with our buy one, get one line offer, and you will see us continue to test new ways to capitalize on the significant opportunities we see ahead for us in wireless in terms of both increasing the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 12%, as well as selling additional lines per account.\nWireless continues to be a key growth area for us and one in which we are striking the right balance in delivering exceptional value to our customers, bundling to enhance our opportunities in broadband, and continuing to drive profitability. Higher international connectivity revenue was mainly driven by broadband, which accounts for over 2/3 of our international revenue and grew at a mid-teens rate reflecting strong ARPU growth. The remainder is wireless, which grew due to both additional lines and ARPU growth, but at a lower rate due to the variability in handset sales. Business Services connectivity revenue growth of 6% reflects steady growth in small business with even faster growth in mid market, and enterprise.\nWhile the SMB market remains competitive, we are competing aggressively by delivering best-in-class products and services and growing revenue through ARPU growth driven by higher adoption of additional products that expand our relationship with our SMB customers like Mobile Security, Edge Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro as well as through targeted rate opportunities at the mid-market and enterprise level. Our revenue growth is primarily fueled by the increase in our customers driven by the investments we have made in this space to build sales and fulfillment as well as expanding our capabilities in managed services, wide area networking, and cybersecurity. Finally, video and other revenue declined in the quarter.\nThe high single-digit decline in our video revenue is a function of continued customer losses, coupled with slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower other revenue mainly reflects the continued customer losses in wireline voice. Connectivity and Platforms' total EBITDA increased 1.6%, with margin up 90 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the continued mix shift to our higher-margin connectivity businesses, coupled with ongoing expense management. As I have previously mentioned in prior quarters, and think is worth noting here, is that the only expense line item that had a meaningful increase over last year was direct product costs, which are success-based and tied to growth in our connectivity business. Businesses breaking out our Connectivity and Platforms.\nEBITDA results. Further, residential EBITDA increased 1.1%, with margins improving 100 basis points to 39.9%, and business services EBITDA growth rebounded nicely this quarter, returning to a mid-single-digit rate, while margin declined 70 basis points to 57%, reflecting the investments in sales and fulfillment we are making to scale in the mid-market and enterprise space. Now let's turn to content and experiences on slide 5. Revenue decreased 7.5% to $10.1 billion, and EBITDA decreased 11% to $1.9 billion. I'll detail these results further starting with Theme Parks. Revenue decreased 11%, and EBITDA declined 24% in the quarter compared to last year's record level for a second quarter. As Mike highlighted, 2/3 of the decline was driven by our domestic parks due to lower attendance compared to last year, largely reflecting two factors: normalization in demand post-COVID combined with the timing of our domestic attractions.\nThis is the first full quarter comparison to the highly successful opening of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood early last year, which drove that park's record results in Q2 of last year. We haven't launched a major new attraction in Orlando since VelociCoaster in 2021 in anticipation of Epic Universe, which we originally planned to open this year. On the international side, underlying growth at our park in Osaka continues, partially offset by foreign currency as well as some softness at Universal Beijing due to the local macroeconomic environment. To reiterate, we couldn't be more bullish about the long-term trajectory of parks. In addition to Epic Universe, we have a fantastic slate of new attractions and experiences on the horizon.\nDonkey Kong Country in Osaka and a Fast & Furious roller coaster in Hollywood, as well as the Universal Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas and our Universal Kids Resort coming to Texas. Now let's turn to Media where revenue increased 2% and EBITDA was up 9% driven by Peacock. Peacock revenue grew 28% with 9% growth in advertising and 61% growth in distribution driven by the 38% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 33 million. On a sequential basis, we held subscribers fairly steady. As we noted during our last earnings call, our focus in Q2 was on subscriber retention due to the lack of new tentpole content in the quarter. This timing and content also contributed to some relief in our expenses which helped drive year-over-year Peacock EBITDA improvement of $300 million.\nWe are pleased with the progress we are making with media EBITDA for H1 of the year, up nearly 3% as the improvement at Peacock outweighed the pressure at our TV networks. As we look to H2 of the year, we expect continued modest growth in overall media EBITDA, but with some variation in the degree of year-over-year improvement between the quarters, driven by the timing of sports entertainment launches and marketing. Beginning in Q3, we are loaded with incremental content, including the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, which will have an additional game fall into Q3, as well as Peacock's exclusive NFL game from Brazil, and the return of Big Ten. Given the timing of this content, EBITDA growth will be skewed to Q4.\nAt Studios, revenue decreased 27% and EBITDA decreased 51%, reflecting both the timing of our film slate and a tough comparison relative to last year's second quarter, which included the tremendously successful Super Mario Bros. Movie as well as Fast X. We have said our film slate is weighted to the back half of the year, which we believe will drive better year over year performance and we're off to a strong start. Despicable Me 4 had a terrific opening weekend earlier this month, making the Despicable Me series of movies the first animated franchise in history to cross the $5 billion mark. Twisters is off to a strong start, landing at number one at the box office this past weekend. We're excited about our upcoming titles including Wild Robot in September and Wicked in November.\nI'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which includes a $2 billion increase in cash taxes over last year's level. Total capital spending declined 10% compared to last year, with the $3.4 billion in spending, reflecting the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers, such as expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business, and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe theme park ahead of its opening in 2025. Turning to return of capital for the quarter, we returned a total of $3.4 billion to shareholders. This includes share repurchases of $2.2 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion.\nNotably, since we restarted our buyback program just three years ago, we have reduced our share count by 16% and returned just under $50 billion to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends. Prudently balancing investments we've made in the business around our six core growth drivers, protecting a strong balance sheet and providing strong capital returns to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nBrian, thanks.\nAnd just to tie everything together, what Mike and Jason have just said, and as our results continue to show, I.\nReally believe we are dealing with the.\nCompetitive landscape shifts exceptionally well. That's because we have a great team across the company that knows how to execute and innovate. We have the scale, balance sheet, and relevancy to compete with anyone. So if you think about what we're doing to position ourselves for growth, we've expanded our broadband network by 1.2 million new homes passed in the last 12 months, the most in the company's history, and we plan to continue to do that. We're upbeat about the long term in parks despite this quarter and are about to finish building the biggest, most technologically advanced theme park to hit the US market in decades with Epic Universe next year.\nAs you've seen recently, instead of engaging in a process to buy content companies, we have focused primarily on organic opportunities like the NBA, one of the most coveted sports franchises across the globe, which will help drive growth for us well into the future. With that, let's hand it over to Marci to take your questions.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star and the number one on your touchtone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star and the number two. If you are using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up your handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, please press star then the number one on your touchtone phone. Our first question today is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Thank you.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Mike, thanks for all the detail on the NBA contract. Appreciate that. I wanted to ask about parks and broadband, maybe. Jason, on broadband, you made some comments about ACP and how Dave and the team are managing. It seems like it's going well. It seemed like you were implying Q3 losses might be down from Q2. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you talked about an offset around seasonality. I just wondered if maybe you could revisit that and a little bit about how you guys are managing it from a product and marketing point of view in Q3. Presumably that's the end. We can move on beyond Q3. We can put ACP behind this. I wanted to ask about that. Then on parks, thank you for all the color.\nWhen you guys look at your pacing data, which you've got months ahead of you that you can see, is there any, do you see any turn or should we be thinking about year on year pressure on this segment moving at least through the end of the year and into next year as we get ready for Epic? Any more color on sort of what the outlook looks like would be appreciated. Thanks so much.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey Ben, this is Dave. I'm going to jump in a little bit on the ACP part first. So, I think it's important to just cover a little bit of context, and then we'll get to the outlook and view of Q3. You know, most of the enrolled ACP customers, as we said before, have been with us, and they're on a postpaid basis. So I think that's an important thing to remember. Our strategy has been consistent. We've been looking to help the ACP customers stay connected through a variety of options starting with Internet Essentials. And since 2011 we've connected millions in the largest, most comprehensive private sector Internet adoption program in the country.\nThe good news is that our ACP customers are eligible to switch to the Internet Essentials tiers that we have, and we have a couple in addition. We have Xfinity Mobile, and we have good offers through this transition.\nTo help them save money on their monthly bills. The Internet Essentials customer, the plus tier customers, could take a free line of Xfinity Mobile for a year, and ACP customers who add Xfinity Mobile can get an additional free unlimited line for a year. So, and then we just started with Now Internet, Now Mobile, and so nothing material on that, but I think it puts us in good position as we complete the transition. We spent, as Jason said, we've spent a lot of time thinking about this, been very proactive, prepared for this, and in many ways it's similar to the promotional rollout activity that we've managed for decades. So we're used to that on the, you know, from a subscriber viewpoint. Also, as Jason said, we saw a minimal impact in ACP in Q2.\nLooking forward, we expect the bulk of the ACP subscriber-related activity to happen in the third quarter, including losses associated with nonpay churn, very focused on retention. It's early, but the biggest impact I think we're going to see will be on the nonpay side, and as we're just getting into the beginning of the nonpay cycles, encouragingly, we're not seeing much voluntary churn in this group. So our goal we'd like to get through the ACP impact as quickly as possible. And right now, we're planning to take a reserve on incremental nonpay activity in the third quarter. But again, it is too early to quantify, and we just won't know until we're further through the cycle. So we have a normal disconnect process that we've managed for a long period of time. And again, this is the postpaid universe that we have managed through.\nSo that is our view. I think it will be primarily within Q3, but encouraged by at least the voluntary churn aspect. Jason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, I think Dave said it perfectly. As you think about Q3, Ben, I think unpacking it and similar to what we saw in Q2, the competitive environment remains intense but it's stable. It's sort of no worse, no better than we've seen over the past couple of quarters. So I think that's the starting point. Second, as we pointed out, it's a quarter where we do get seasonal tailwinds. The same things that were headwinds in Q2 largely become tailwinds in Q3. And then there's ACP that works against that where we will see an impact. As Dave said, the intention is to be largely through the impact by the end of Q3 between actions we've seen and then a reserve we will take. And so that's the thing we have to make sure we're executing very well against.\nBut as Dave said, the early trends on that, whether it's voluntary churn or trends we've seen so far in non-pay and building non-pay and reserves around that, are encouraging.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nGreat, then Ben. It's Mike on parks. So, to hit on that again, and appreciate the question. I think we covered a lot in the earlier remarks, but I'll start where Brian last finished, which is we couldn't be more excited about and confident in the long-term trajectory of the parks business. Particularly as we look ahead to next year with Epic Universe, which is truly looking truly unbelievable. And then other attractions coming. Hollywood's going to get a coaster, and Donkey Kong Country into Osaka in the latter part of this year. Timing TBD on both of those. But in the near term, I think the domestic attendance challenge, that was what drove 2/3 of the poor comparison.\nThe factors causing that, which is really the, you know, COVID pull forward that we talked about and the timing of attractions, particularly in Hollywood lapping Super Nintendo and in Florida the fact that we originally planned to have Epic opened this year, but with COVID pushed it back and so have a lull in the action. We haven't started a new big attraction since blockbuster VelociCoaster in 2021. So as a result of that, I think the factor is, even though we're excited about Hollywood Horror Nights in the second half of the year and a little bit of moving past lapping, I think that the trends that we are experiencing likely continue.\nUntil we get to Epic opening up sometime next year.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly next question is coming from Craig Moffett. From MoffettNathanson, your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi.\nThank you. Good morning. A little bit more on ACP, if I could. Mike, could you just give us any early insight you've got on the delinquency rate for people that are 30 days or 60 days past due, just so we can sort of get a sense of what non pays may look like? And then presumably there was some impact, certainly there was in the first quarter of just lower gross adds in the category because new enrollments were shut off and.\nSomebody moving across the street, for example, would lose it at their old address but not be able to get it at their new one. Do you have any estimate for how much ACP impact there might have been?\nIn the gross ad category? And then just one. Just simple housekeeping question. You typically report cable margins on the conference call in the script. I didn't hear it, maybe I missed it. But I'm wondering if you could tell us what cable margins were in the quarter.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nI'll let Dave handle the ACP question. Craig, it's Mike.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Craig. Dave. So in terms of delinquency rates, there's nothing, you know, worth watching as we just have a normal process that we manage through, you know, based on due dates, invoices, and it goes, you know, anywhere from, you know, two to three months. There's nothing at this point to report on. At this stage, we watch it closely other than to go back to what I said, been very proactive. And I think we're helped by experience in promotional roles and the fact that we tried to put customers into packages that made sense for them proactively. So there's a lot of work that went into that ahead of time, but nothing at this stage. And we'll give more as we go.\nIn terms of the question, in terms of lower gross adds impacts on connects, it was not material that we saw in Q2, so maybe just a little bit in terms of things that we said, but it wasn't a substantial impact in Q2. We think the bulk of what we're seeing is really going to be on the non-pay side, which will occur in Q3.\nCraig, let me hit the margin question real quick. So I would say the way we're looking at the business is really across connectivity and platforms. So looking at it that way and managing the business that way. But to unpack it, legacy cable margin, if you wanted to look at it that way, the margin margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter. So really strong operating improvement to 48.4%.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay, thanks. Could I squeeze in one more? Just thinking right now about BEAD and whether we might see more capital investment on the BEAD side.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYeah, this is Dave. BEAD. We're looking at it very closely. It is going to be worked out on a state-by-state basis. We're optimistic in a lot of cases, but we'll have to look for the guidelines and the specifics tied to it. Nothing at this point would suggest we're going to be beyond the capital intensity that we've already given out. I think with all we're optimistic. One of the points that Brian mentioned, you know, the 1.2 million that we've done in the last 12 months is astounding and the machine is really going. So we're leaning in going for it. But you know, BEAD will be on a state-by-state basis.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator, we are now ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nSenior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. I have an MBA question and also one on advertising.\nThe benefits as you outlined are pretty obvious of getting the NBA, but it does come at a significant price. I was hoping you could walk us through how you expect to make a positive financial return and maybe elaborate a little more on what role Peacock will play since there's a clear benefit there. But how does it affect? How does this new deal impact programming spend for other areas, including general entertainment? And then as part of Peacock, maybe you could talk about the StreamSaver, the bundle with Netflix and Apple TV, and the response you've had. And then on advertising, the upfront is now done. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the unique selling position you've had relative to others and what the volume is, overall pricing, et cetera, just what you're seeing in the overall market.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSure. Hey Jessica, it's Mike. So I think I've essentially covered everything that I wanted to cover and can cover at this stage on NBA in the prepared remarks. Obviously when the NBA makes its ultimate announcements, we'll, you know, that'll be another moment where we can go deeper. But just to the point to point generally is that we are looking at the NBA as we all said, as some of the premier content that is culturally relevant, excellent audience widens out the calendar year for us across Peacock and NBC, can do a lot with the demographics that follow the NBA around other programming.\nSo when you think about the business case for it, when you look at the long term and as we are managing the media business, broadcast and Peacock as one, I think the unique reach that we have and ability for a sport like the NBA to reach so far with our existing broadcast business and use, as I said earlier, plenty of exclusive games for Peacock to drive excellent acquisition in Peacock, and we've talked about before using NBA and as we talked about before, sports has been a great source of acquisition for us in Peacock and a great source of value to the consumer. But what's very interesting to us is how significant the viewership is of sports viewers on Peacock, of things other than sports.\nSo when you take a zoom out and think about the total picture of what we're trying to do, which is to bring our excellent TV media assets into the future, I think you can, you know, we view the NBA as an excellent piece in that puzzle, and it will allow us to rebalance programming from, you know, from other areas. Obviously we'll fill a few nights, you know, on NBC with this content versus other content, and we'll, you know, use this to do acquisition spend in Peacock and lighten up in some other places. But the long-term goal, Peacock is to have a service that is a balance of sports, entertainment, and news.\nAnd so our content teams are now very focused on that new audience and what we're going to be able to do to drive entertainment content with the advantage of being linked closely to the NBA and to the audience that follows.\nIt.\nOn advertising.\nSo second quarter pretty, you know, only a slight step down from the first quarter, but clearly we had a much heavier load of sports in the first quarter than the second quarter. And so that, you know, adjusting for that, I'd say again that the advertising market remains pretty stable. We feel very well positioned for the second half of the year with the Olympics coming up, you know, starting this Friday, elections, and a great slate of content coming to NBC and Peacock. In terms of the upfront, we're pleased with our results. Total volume for us is going to be basically in line, you know, with last year, as is linear price. We got well over $1 billion in upfront volume for Peacock again, which and nice growth over what we had last year.\nAnd so if you step back, we'd say the overall upfront market was pretty solid. We moved quickly given our strength of our assets to secure the volume that we got. So we feel we were a success in this more challenging upfront given the arrival of so many of the new players, especially in the AVOD and SVOD space. So that's the report on the upfronts, but we're moving forward and feel like the team did quite a good job.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe on the cable side a little bit better trends in both video and wireless. On the video side, what's driving the improvement there? Do you expect it to continue? Are you seeing any effects of the launch of the NOW brand? In wireless, you guys talked about some new pricing and promotion that you guys think you're benefiting at all from some of the ACP losses. On the prepaid side, I don't know if you guys saw yesterday Verizon announced that they sort of turned off 400,000 subscribers. I think we'll see something similar with the rest of the wireless companies. Do you think this underlying growth is sustainable or do you think that ACP is somehow boosting the growth at this point? Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable",
    "content3": "Hey John.\nDave. So, terms of video.\nAs Jason said.\nOur video losses are lower than the ones last year. This time. We did take a slightly less.\nRate increase this year than last year, and the key for us in video is just positioning video with broadband, and that video does help in that regard. We've seen positive churn in terms of video, reimagining video around the NOW TV product and IP, and that has been steady. It's still early, but has been helpful. So video, I think, for the right segment we offer a lot of value, and we continue to position it, I think, very well with broadband, but difficult and still in terms of some of the fees and things that we have, but I think an important category for us. So in terms of the mobile side, NOW Mobile is not material at this point, way too early. The acceleration in line adds over Q1, driven by the early success of the new pricing plans.\nReally competitive now in multi-line pricing, launched in April, targeted it for a while. Now it's scaling, and it's really gotten traction as well. As the buy one get one line offer to our base. So wireless is such an important part of our overall strategy and key that it's 12% penetration. We got great runway ahead. Business mobile is just getting going, and it's a great position for us in terms of convergence. I think we're uniquely positioned in terms of ubiquitous offers across our entire footprint, and mobile will be front and center as we approach the Olympics and we will have a great offer with broadband with mobile being able to tie all this together. So very excited with it.\nThe comment, just one other part in terms of what happened in terms of Verizon's unpacking. That the only thing I'll say is I think it's an important distinction that our ACP customers are postpaid versus their prepaid. It's a different group, a different dynamic, and so not really. We're just getting going on our NOW products, and so it's very, very early on. Excited about that, and I think we're introducing it at a very good moment, but it's not material at this stage.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks John. Operator. We're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks, guys. I guess for Jason, two quick ones on content costs in the connectivity business. They came in quite a bit lower than we expected, and I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on what's driving the trend there and how sustainable it is. And then we're trending a little bit lower than guidance on CapEx so far this year. I'm wondering if that's just timing related, if it picks up in the back half of the year, and then Mike, I'm not sure if I heard you loud and clear on having sort of said what you can on the NBA deal. I'm wondering if you can just give us a little bit of context around the timing of costs and revenues though.\nI recognize it's forward-looking, but when should we expect to see the cost from the new contract start to hit? Thank you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Jonathan.\nWhy don't I start with CapEx? Dave will hit content costs, and then Mike with NBA. So on CapEx, you're right. We've had some variability this year, I would say, you know, relative to the initial guidance we gave both on the content experiences side where we talked about, you know, this is the final significant year of Epic spending, and then we get relief beyond this, and then on the connectivity and platform side, which I think is probably where more your question was. We gave a capital intensity envelope as we entered the year. We also said, you know, intend to do 1.1 million plus in terms of homes passed. We're obviously trending a little bit above that at this point, but still feel comfortable with the capital intensity envelope that we gave. So there are some timing aspects around equipment purchases within the year.\nI would say still feel comfortable with the existing capital intensity envelope and within that doing more and more homes passed at a really efficient rate. You know, I think that's a testament to how the team's executing here.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, John. Jonathan. Dave. So just on the content cost side of things, that's also timing related.\nWe.\nThere, you know, in the sports side, well-known thing in terms of RSNs.\nBut there are other timing-related things. Every contract with a programming partner is different, every relationship is different. So we won't go into the specifics, but it is key that we focus on, for us, flexibility, increasing market choice. We segment the marketplace, both video and broadband and together, and that is important that we're competitive in every segment. And at the end of the day we're focusing on value, you know, combining linear streaming considerations on a case-by-case basis. But mostly, at this point, it was timing-related.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nJonathan, it's Mike on NBA. You know, I wish it were sooner, but the contract doesn't start until the 2025, 2026 season. So it's fall of 2025 that we would start to bear the expense of the right side of it. And obviously that is also as we build into that when we would begin to see the benefits of subscriber acquisition around the NBA.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThis is Brian. Just want to just close out, perhaps, that Mike's opening comments on the NBA.\nYou know, opportunities like this come along very rarely when there's a long-term relationship up for grabs inside. And we'll have, you know, when it gets all announced, the detail that Mike described, we have probably more content than anybody, and it's all, I think, at a value that we'll be able to, as one of the other questions asked, you know, support and demonstrate. And one of our real advantages here is the way we're running the media business. And Mike created one group with our existing assets like NBC and our growing asset like Peacock. And putting that together is very appealing for the reach, for the consumer access, for the innovation that we'll have in the years ahead. And you'll see some of that innovation during the Olympics.\nThere'll be a lot of content on NBC, but way more content on Peacock, and it allows for the trends that we're seeing in viewing behavior. So it's a very exciting moment, and I think we'll have more to say in the weeks ahead.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Line is now live.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you for the question. I just have two, one on business services and one on wireless. First on business services, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the key initiatives or things that might be changing at Comcast Business following Ed's appointment as president to more aggressively pursue the mid market or enterprise. What are you seeing in terms of the competitive side within SMB? Is it just fixed wireless or is there more to that? And then on wireless, given the strong potential upgrade cycle on the back of AI smartphones and the iPhone 16, I was just wondering if you talk about the Xfinity Mobile strategy to capitalize this on this from a promotional marketing perspective, what levers are you planning to pull this holiday to potentially lean into wireless to help the broader business and wireless at large? Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nGot it. Thank you. This is Dave. So a couple of things. Let me start with business.\nAs you said, it is competitive in the small business categories, competitive in every category, but in particular the small business one. There certainly is some fixed wireless that we've seen; saw it in the Verizon results, pretty high percentage of the fixed wireless that are in the small business thing. And we look at that closely. We are intensely focused on our competitive playbooks, and we're going to constantly compete for share, but we're also focused on revenue per relationship. And so in the small business area, before getting into mid-market, we're doing a lot of product upgrades, adding value and speed, WiFi security, and so made good progress and revenue focus around in small business. It's such a huge opportunity for us still in terms of small business. But Ed has stepped right in.\nIt's a terrific team in the business services group that he's working with. There really is, I think, a unique opportunity when you look at the overall addressable market of $60 billion, or less than 20% there, and a huge chunk of this will be mid market and enterprise. You add on top of that international opportunities that we're beginning to coordinate and work well with Dana and the team at Sky. So we really are seeing nice relationship growth in mid market and enterprise. That's the starting point. But in addition to, like, all of our strategies, we're adding more products and attaching new products on these relationships and going beyond just connectivity into a full managed relationship basis.\nSo ED is driving that, and we're in a good competitive position for growth, and I think we have a good ability to increase ARPU across an increasing higher-end base of customers. So on the, you know, the mobile side of upgrade, you know, it is every single upgrade moment. Pay close attention to that one too. We're optimistic. We're in good position. We have a great trade-in program for mobile that we've had in place now for a while. And then, in addition to that, we go in and out in terms of subsidies on top of that trade-in program. And then, when good upgrade moments happen, we are the switching provider. So when people, we have great core rates, and we have good handset offers, and good position for it.\nSo, you know, being a switching provider, I think we are, I think, in a unique position to really take advantage of that. And when you look at things going into, you know, the optimism for Q3, one of the most important programs that we'll do along with the handset upgrade initiative on mobile will be the Olympics. And the Olympics are such a unique opportunity for us to showcase the best broadband, the best mobile service offering. Combining those two things together in such an attractive offer on top of that is the greatest UI in the marketplace that helps you find whatever you want. So really excited about that. Look for that in the next couple of days. But mobile will be front and center along with broadband when that happens.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator.\nWe have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our final question today is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThanks. So with mid-split now reaching over 40% of the footprint, I was just wondering if you have an updated outlook on when you think you'll be at DOCSIS 4.0 for most of your broadband passing. And maybe within this you could just update us on where fiber overlap is. But also as you get through this network investment architecture that you laid out earlier this year, when you think about the capital intensity and capex coming down and we'll start to see that benefit in growing free cash flow. So timing on that I think would be really interesting. And then how are you thinking about getting to just break even on Peacock? You talked about media EBITDA on a total basis growing in the first half and in the second half too.\nIt seems like if the Peacock losses keep getting better at this pace, you could be close to break even this time next year. But I know you've got NBA coming, so just wondering if we could think about that benchmark quite yet. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey Steven, this is Dave. Let me start and then hand it over on the Peacock side. So we're 42% mid-split right now. We expect to be 50% by year-end, and the DOCSIS 4.0 that follows multiple markets. So far it's early, no specifics in terms of the final rollout on that, but it really is tracking very well. On top of.\nA lot of new footprint expansions, the 1.2 million over the last 12 months. This upgrade program is moving along very well, and it tracks to where the customers are and our steady focus around the higher end. You know, one of the things that we see, you know, we have the most effective and efficient build that's ubiquitous, that is addressing speed, capacity, coverage, and it helps us because as we're doing this, remember we're virtualizing huge parts of the network and avoiding future node splits. So it's very efficient in helping us. You know, with 70% of our customers on 500 megabits per second or higher, 1/3 are taking a gig, and it's tracking to maybe one of the biggest tailwinds that is out there. That's the fact that our network consumption is still low, double digits increasing, and that's not stopping.\nAnd so we're putting ourselves in position with a great upgrade program. And so that to me is.\nI think a great advantage that we do have in terms of competition. In terms of fiber, we're now 50% in terms of the overbuilt. We expect by the end of 2025 that'll get to 60% and will probably go higher than that. We have a long track record of competing against fiber, 20 years at this point. So we do think that fiber is quite frankly the longer term competitor. Keeping our eye on, compete fiercely against fixed wireless and every competitor. But we anticipate where they're building, what they're doing, and keeping track of all of that. So, like our results and encouraged when you look going into Q3, one of the reasons of optimism is that voluntary churn that continues to perform very well. And I think it's our superior network combined with better products and extreme focus on competition.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nStephen, I would just round that out on the capital intensity question because I think embedded in that was sort of a long-term capital intensity question. If you look at what we're doing now, you know the path towards mid-splits which, as Dave mentioned, really good progress there, that kicking off DOCSIS 4.0 and then adding 1.2 million homes passed which is a record for us in the last 12 months and doing that all within through the existing capital intensity envelope which is one of if not the lowest in the industry. So very good progress there as you think about longer-term. A lot of people ask this question in the context of, is there the next big thing coming in terms of the network upgrade?\nWe feel very comfortable between mid-split and DOCSIS 4.0, that leading to multi-gig symmetrical speeds, that that is the network upgrade for the future. So we don't see the next big thing coming. But one area that I'd point out, we'd love to do more homes passed, you know, we've accelerated the rate from.\n800,000 in the past couple of years.\nUp to currently 1.2 million. We won't gate capital intensity because of that. If those, if those are good returns and things we should be doing, we'd love to do more there.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nStephen, on Peacock and media EBITDA, I think you said you heard us right. Anyway, you heard me right. I've been talking since I've been doing this that I don't really look at Peacock standalone. I mean it's an interesting exercise, and I'm happy to share the numbers of what the, you know, the loss is on Peacock as we're building it. But strategically to not pursue that path would leave the existing media business on a downward trend. So I think we are thinking about it over multiple years. I'm very confident that what we're doing around Peacock and the media business business together, operating together is going to put us on a path to optimize that business. And as you said, I think this is a year where we see the growth in Peacock offsetting the decline in some of our linear businesses.\nThat's basically a trend I would expect to see carry forward. There's going to be ebbs and flows. As Brian said.\nSomething like NBA is, you know, once in a generation almost to, to get an opportunity like that. So obviously we'll make some adjustments, and it might pause our trajectory the year we take it on board. But I think it's part and parcel of the idea that we're bringing the media business to a better future by investing behind Peacock and doing it together with all our assets, entertainment, sports, and news as what our media business will look to be in the future. Well, thank you everybody. I think that's it. I stole Marci's line. Go ahead.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP, Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. This concludes our second quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's question and answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast investor relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."

Welcome to Comcast first quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Executive Vice President Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer.\nThis conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Across the company, our team is managing extremely well in a highly competitive and evolving marketplace. We have a clear vision for how we are going to compete now and into the future, combined with a sharp focus on execution. Equally important, our disciplined capital allocation strategy coupled with our strong balance sheet puts us in an enviable position relative to our peers, and to invest organically and aggressively in our six scaled and diverse growth businesses, namely residential broadband, wireless business services, theme parks, studios, and streaming.\nThese businesses comprise more than 55% of the company's total revenue today, and that proportion will only grow over time.\nIn the first quarter, these businesses generated a high single digit increase in revenue on a trailing twelve month basis, and when combined with our substantial share repurchase activity, enabled us to deliver double digit adjusted EPS growth as well as significant growth in free cash flow per share. In fact, since 2018 we grew adjusted EPS over 50% and free cash flow per share nearly 25%.\nNow for some of the highlights of the first quarter, I'll start with broadband. The broadband market remains extremely competitive, particularly within the market for more price conscious consumers. We continue to be intensely focused on segmentation, providing customers with options that meet both their lifestyle and budget.\nImportantly, we are striking the right balance between ARPU and subscribers, which is clearly reflected in our Q1 results where despite modest subscriber losses, ARPU grew over 4%, driving mid single digit growth in residential broadband revenue to over $6.5 billion. We continue to see extremely encouraging broadband consumption trends across our base of 32 million customers. Usage on our network rose double digits year over year with broadband only households consuming over 700 GB of data each month and our broadband customers continue to value faster speeds.\nToday over 70% of our residential subscribers receive speeds of 500 Mbps or higher and around 1/3 are getting a gig or more. We believe that consumers' expectations for their broadband experience in terms of speed, reliability, security, and performance will only increase over time. It is extremely important to us that our network upgrades stay well ahead of this demand.\nOur deployment of mid-splits doubled year over year and now reach 40% of the footprint. The investments we are making to increase capacity and incorporate multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds everywhere we offer service put us in a great position to capitalize on these very favorable consumer trends, and when combined with our rapid footprint expansion, set us up to gain market share and return to broadband subscriber growth over time.\nTurning to wireless, we increased our domestic customer lines by 21% year over year to nearly seven million. Yet with wireless penetration of our residential broadband customer base still only 11%, we have plenty of room to grow. We continue to see the benefit of bundling broadband and mobile, which decreases churn and improves customer lifetime value. Our customers also benefit by being connected to our WiFi network, which is the largest in the nation.\nIn fact, 90% of all Xfinity mobile traffic is delivered over WiFi, not cellular, and we are constantly adding new features to further differentiate the experience. The most recent example is our introduction of WiFi Boost, which enables any Xfinity Mobile customer to experience speeds of up to a gig whenever they connect to our 23 million hotspots at no additional cost across our connectivity and platforms.\nBusiness, we're focused on profitably serving each segment of the market from our premium and traditional customers, who want fully featured products, to more price-driven consumers. With regard to the latter, we are introducing NOW, a new brand and product portfolio targeting the prepaid market that delivers high-quality, low-cost internet, mobile, and streaming TV products with simple all-in pricing.\nNOW Internet and mobile will be particularly helpful to those Americans impacted by the end of ACP, bringing them another option for affordable, reliable connectivity and supplementing our Internet Essentials program which we offer to eligible households as part of our long-standing commitment to help close the digital divide in America. Turning to content and experiences, let's start with parks.\nWe continue to see strong underlying demand in both Hollywood and Japan, where healthy attendance and per cap levels were once again driven by the success of Super Nintendo World. Building on our momentum, later this year we're opening our newest Nintendo-themed land, Donkey Kong Country, which will increase the size of Super Nintendo World in Japan by 70%.\nSwitching gears to Orlando, we started to feel some pressure on attendance levels late in the first quarter, which tends to occur in tandem with the ebbs and flows of new attractions in the market. Right now we happen to be lapping the multi-year surge in attendance from our opening of new attractions in prior periods, but we remain confident about our longer-term growth opportunities, especially as we look ahead to next year with the opening of Epic Universe. With three new hotels and five immersive worlds featuring more than 50 attractions, entertainment, dining, and shopping experiences, it will be the most technologically advanced park in the world.\nTogether with our three current gates in Orlando, Epic will enable us to offer a full week's vacation experience to even more guests. Moving to Studios, we're incredibly proud of our film team and our recent ranking as the number one global studio by worldwide box office and winner of eight Academy Awards, including best picture for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, on the back of our fantastic performance in 2023. The power of our studios continued this quarter with the theatrical release of Kung Fu Panda 4, which has grossed over $480 million in worldwide box office to date, and we have an exciting slate still ahead.\nFor the third year in a row, we'll release more movies than any other major studio, with The Fall Guy, an action thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt coming this May, Despicable Me 4, Illumination's newest installment of the highest-grossing animated franchise, and as well as our adaptation of Twisters, both debuting in July, and Wicked, one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2024 coming in November. Finally, in media, we are successfully managing the segment as one business across linear and streaming by providing the tens of millions of traditional paid TV subscribers as well as streamers.\nWith choice in how they engage with us, we continue to generate significant audience for our programming. Big events like the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, Big Ten, top entertainment shows like Saturday Night Live, and Law & Order.\nWith strong consumer demand for our content, we're well positioned to evolve with the changing market. Our exclusively streamed NFL Wild Card game was a big success this past quarter. We added and then retained even more new Peacock subscribers than we expected. Overall, people are staying with us to engage in a broad range of content, spending 90% of their time on the platform viewing non-sports programming. This includes scripted shows like Ted and reality shows like The Traitors, both of which ranked within Nielsen's streaming top 10, and our award-winning collection of films like Oppenheimer, which premiered exclusively on Peacock in February and was the most watched film across all streaming in its first seven days on the platform. Clearly, Peacock has been on a great trajectory since our launch four years ago.\nWe're at 34 million paid subscribers, having grown 12 million year over year and at $10 ARPU. Looking ahead, our content offering provides such a great value proposition that we should have some real pricing power over time. Of course, sports also play an important role in our media business, and that's especially true this year. Following the Kentucky Derby in May, we'll have the Paris Olympics for 17 nights this summer.\nWith more programming hours on the NBC broadcast network than any previous Olympics and over 5,000 hours of live coverage on Peacock, the Games are on track to generate the most advertising revenue in history with $1.2 billion in ad sales commitments. Right after the Olympics, we have the return of football with Big Ten Sunday Night Football and the NFL's first ever Friday Night opening game from Sao Paulo streaming exclusively on Peacock.\nSo, wrapping up, I am really proud of the work that our teams across the company are doing together. We're executing at the highest level and positioning ourselves for growth in a challenging and dynamic marketplace. So, Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Mike and good morning everyone. I'll start with our consolidated results on slide 4. Total revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion and within this our six major growth drivers generated nearly $17 billion in revenue, well over half of total company revenue, and once again have shown steady and consistent growth at a high single digit rate over the past 12 months. While EBITDA was in line with prior year's level at $9.4 billion, we generated a high level of free cash flow this quarter at $4.5 billion and we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases.\nOver the last 12 months we have reduced our share count by nearly 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 14%. Now let's go through our business results starting on slide 5 with connectivity and platforms.\nNote that our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British pound, which was up 4% year-over-year. So as usual, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the connectivity and platforms business, I will refer to year over year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in connectivity revenues offset mainly by declines in video revenue.\nResidential connectivity revenue grew 7%, driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 13% growth in domestic wireless, and 19% growth in international connectivity. While business services connectivity revenue grew 5% in domestic broadband, our revenue growth was driven by very strong ARPU, which increased 4.2% and came in a bit above our historical range.\nOur team is doing an excellent job of customer segmentation while balancing rate and volume, and we are encouraged by the positive consumer behavior trends we see in our base of 32 million customers. Bandwidth requirements and engagement are increasing at a rapid clip while the vast majority of our customers are now on speeds of 500 megabits or higher and adopting advanced tiers of service like XFI Complete at a higher rate.\nAs Mike mentioned, it continues to be a very competitive environment and we lost 65,000 subscribers in the first quarter following the loss of 34,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023. As we sit here right now, we do not see this trend improving in the near term. We expect churn could be elevated given the end of ACP, which is only fully funded through April and partially funded through May.\nWe remain in constant communication with our ACP customers and we'll continue to be diligent in helping this customer segment stay connected through various options, whether that's our successful Internet Essentials program or our new prepaid NOW offerings as Mike described. In addition, I want to remind you that Q2 also tends to experience seasonal headwinds. While it's a competitive market, especially for the price-driven segment, we will continue to compete aggressively yet in a financially balanced way and expect to drive healthy broadband revenue growth through growth in ARPU, which we expect to remain well within our historical range of 3% to 4% growth even as we manage through the ACP transition.\nTurning to domestic wireless, revenue growth of 13% was due to higher service revenue driven by a 21% year-over-year increase in our customer lines, ending the quarter at 6.9 million in total, including the 289,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We are consistently in the marketplace testing new offers, including some recent new pricing plans targeted at multi-line customers, the new NOW Mobile product, as well as our buy one get one line offer.\nWe continue to see significant opportunity in wireless to increase the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 11%, and to sell additional lines per account. International connectivity revenue reflects strong growth in broadband revenue driven by solid ARPU growth, as well as growth in wireless due to additional customer lines and also higher ARPU for business services connectivity.\nWe generated 5% revenue growth driven by higher ARPU in small business and broader growth in both customers and additional solutions for mid-market and enterprise. The SMB market has gotten more competitive, but we'll aggressively defend our position and, similar to this quarter, we'll grow revenue by increasing ARPU driven by higher adoption of additional products like Mobile Security, Edge Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro and through targeted rate opportunities.\nMeanwhile, our momentum continues to build in mid-market and enterprise as our expanding capabilities in managed services, wide area networking, and cybersecurity have led to increasing customer wins and the expansion of existing relationships. The strong growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by a decline in video and other revenue.\nThe decline in our video revenue was driven by continued customer losses and slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower other revenue reflects continued customer losses in wireline voice. As I mentioned earlier, Connectivity & Platforms' total EBITDA increased 1.3% with margin of 50 basis points reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses combined with a continued focus on expense management. While margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved even more.\nOur international business was impacted by a reclassification of some expense from capitalized software to operating expenses, creating a tough comparison to last year. We will see a similar trend until we start to lap this change at the end of this year.\nI'll note that absent this change, EBITDA growth in the first quarter would have been about a point higher and our margin improvement would have been about 50 basis points higher. While this change increased our operating expenses this quarter, there was an offsetting decline in connectivity and platforms capital resulting in a neutral impact on net cash flow, which was up 5% this quarter. Breaking out our connectivity and platforms EBITDA results further, residential EBITDA grew 1.1% with margins improving 60 basis points to 38.3%, and business services EBITDA growth was lower than our typical mid single digit level at 2.6% with margins declining 160 basis points to 56.7%.\nThese results include significant investments in the enterprise space including in sales and fulfillment that we are making to drive future revenue growth.\nBusiness services generates well over $5 billion in annual EBITDA, which is margin accretive, and we expect it to continue to be a material contributor to overall connectivity and platforms growth this year and over the longer term. Now let's turn to content and experiences on slide 6. Overall revenue increased 1% to $10.4 billion and EBITDA decreased 7% to $1.5 billion. Let's take a closer look at the details starting with theme parks, revenue increased 2% while EBITDA decreased 4% for the quarter. These results reflect the negative impact of currency as the Japanese yen is at a 34-year low against the dollar.\nAdjusting the results to exclude the impact of foreign currency, parks' revenue would have increased 5% and EBITDA would have been flat. Compared to last year's first quarter, we had strong underlying growth at our park in Osaka, which continues to benefit from demand for Super Nintendo World. We're also seeing growth in Hollywood despite lapping the opening of Super Nintendo World in that park during the quarter.\nBeijing results were relatively flat in what is typically a seasonally light quarter, and Orlando results were below last year but still roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing some pullback from the unprecedented attendance we realized immediately after the pandemic, which we believe is driven by the timing of new attraction openings and some increased competition from other entertainment venues, notably cruises and media, which includes our TV networks and Peacock.\nRevenue increased 4% as Peacock's strong growth of 54% more than offset a low single digit decline at our Linear Networks. Distribution revenue growth of 7% was driven by Peacock with subscription revenue growth of 68% powered by the 55% year over year increase in our paid subscriber base to 34 million, including 3 million net adds in Q1. We are really pleased with Peacock's trajectory. We started the year with an incredibly successful NFL Wildcard game which resulted in a nice lift to paid subs. But even more important was how our broad content offering enabled strong consumer acquisition, retention, and engagement.\nWe've had success across a broad range of content during the quarter including films moving into our Pay 1 window like Oppenheimer, the most watched Pay 1 film in Peacock's history, and The Holdovers as well as successful originals including Apples Never Fall, Ted, and the second season of The Traitors. Looking ahead, we'll continue to be focused on retention particularly in Q2 as we look forward to H2 where we have a substantial amount of acquisition oriented content lined up.\nThis is consistent with Peacock's historical trends, and this year is expected to be driven by the Olympics this summer and the NFL, and Big Ten returning in the fall in addition to the steady stream of films landing on our Pay one window as well as upcoming originals.\nFinally, domestic advertising revenue was flat in the quarter, reflecting a stable overall market with strong advertising growth at Peacock, offset by lower advertising revenue at our linear networks.\nMedia. EBITDA decreased 6%, reflecting the revenue pressure on our linear networks, partially offset by continued year over year improvement in Peacock EBITDA losses, even with the addition of the wildcard rights costs, and we expect to see, on average, even better year over year improvement for Peacock in the coming quarters.\nAt Studios, the revenue decline of 7% reflects lower content licensing, which was impacted by the timing of deliverables related to our film licensing business, which was partially offset by a modest increase in theatrical revenue driven by the strong performance of Kung Fu Panda 4 at the box office this quarter. Studio's EBITDA declined 12%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's film slate, including the highly successful carryover title Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and the timing of licensing deals at film.\nNow, I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow this quarter, and we achieved this even with the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers, specifically our $3.3 billion in total capital spending.\nThis quarter incorporates our efforts in expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business, and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe theme park ahead of its 2025 opening, and working capital was a $940 million drag for the quarter, a significant improvement over last year, a lot of which is timing related. Turning to return of capital for the quarter, we returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders, an increase of 13% year over year.\nThis includes share repurchases of $2.4 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. Putting it all together, in the last 12 months we've returned over $16 billion in capital to shareholders between share repurchases and dividends, reducing our share count by nearly 6%.\nAt the same time, we invested nearly 17 billion back into our businesses in the form of capital and working capital, carefully and consistently balancing reinvesting in our businesses for growth, returning significant capital to shareholders, and doing so with a very strong balance sheet which facilitates this consistency that through a variety of operating environments. Now let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star then the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star then the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers once again. If there are any questions, press star then the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question today is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Two questions maybe for Dave on the cable side. Could you talk maybe bigger picture about customer segmentation, particularly some of the new efforts around prepaid and the NOW brand, as well as some of the speed boost you've done and just how you think about that impacting the business over time? And then if you're willing to give us a little more on how you are able to deliver ARPU growth within the historical range through this ACP transition, just given obviously these subsidies going away.\nAnd then I think for Jason, we expect EBITDA growth this year. Free cash flow growth this year. You guys had a nice free cash flow Q1. I guess I would have expected buybacks to grow as well, year on year.\nAs you point out on that last slide, trailing twelve months $11.5 billion, $2.5 billion in the first quarter. It looks like it's slowing a bit. I just wonder if you could comment if there's anything that's changed on sort of the capital allocation leverage math that we should be thinking about with Comcast this year. Thanks everyone.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Ben, Dave. So let me start with segmentation and a little bit more context on NOW. So stepping back, our segmentation strategy is really key. It starts with, though, the beginning point always for us is premium and traditional broadband customers. We've focused there and invested in terms of better network, better products around providing a better service for the premium segment. We have, though, consistently competed for, you know, all segments.\nAnd as we break it down, you know, we've focused where we think the main point is where broadband's going, and broadband's going is the engagement. And so our focus is to continue to deliver multi-gig symmetrical and build towards that point. So and do this for a variety of internet options.\nThe proof is in the pudding in terms of segmentation in that 70% of our HSD only customers receive speeds of 500 Mbps or higher, and 1/3 of our customers, RESI customers, receive gig plus. It never has been one size fits all. Start there in the focus of premium. But there is currently a lot of activity at the low end of the market, and we've not been as competitive in this space. We've had great products.\nSeveral options. But we, in the prepaid area in particular, believe there is an opportunity to improve our effectiveness there. And so, thus, NOW, and NOW there are three components of NOW. One is prepaid broadband, which, by the way, we've had prepaid broadband for some time, we've just improved upon the value proposition there. So it's our new prepaid broadband update. And second, we have prepaid NOW Mobile, which is new, and then we feel that it's positioned as an alternative to fixed wireless, and that just a lot of activity there. The focus there is there are no credit checks, it's easy.\nIt's no contract and on an everyday price point. So not a lot of movement in terms of just a competitive value-based price point. So.\nAt the time, you know, we're doing now, obviously this is a good alternative to ACP and where that goes. So early to talk about any progress, but we're real pleased with the positioning of the NOW product for the income constrained segment of the market. We've had NOW TV for some time and traction there. So it's a standalone product suite. I feel very good about that on ARPU.\nYou know, this is a strength that we've had. We've been balancing ARPU growth along with share volume for a very long time. So feel good about this quarter, came in very strong at 4.2%, a bit above the historical 3% to 4% range. You know, it's a very competitive marketplace to say the least. And we're just striking the right balance, we think, in volume and rate, and our approach is, you know, reasonable rate increase.\nThe teams have managed this well, leading to rate yield results that exceeded our expectations a bit. But also goes back to the first point, you know, we're segmenting the marketplace and tailoring product approaches that meet each, you know, specific segment. So starts with the high end that I've talked about and very focused there and the results that I've talked about. So that's the starting point. But when you look at our long-standing approach to pricing and packaging, you know, we're going to compete for every segment and it's really focused though where the market's going and making sure that in the long run as the overall usage goes up and to me that is the main point, you have double-digit increases in terms of overall broadband consumption.\nYou have lots of customers, a lot of interest in our high end of our portfolio, and strength in a ubiquitous, reliable, great network that can stand up for every segment, but power through every application that is there. So I think for us pleased with ARPU, and I think we can muscle through this ACP thing and feel good about the guidance that we've been giving, that 3% to 4% historical range.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and, CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThis is Brian.\nI just want to just underscore that.\nLast point that Dave was making. As you look with a longer lens, which I hope the company tries to do.\nThere's, you know, and we just.\nEven yesterday we're looking at our technology roadmap internally and seeing some demonstrations of innovation. It's inspiring and exciting to think about what broadband will actually help you do in the next five, 10 years as a consumer and as a business. And it's kind of in some levels unimaginable.\nA lot of discussion about AI, but so much happening, you know, in the entertainment sector, sports sector, and also in the health care sector and then things we're not even talking about. And so our strategy is pretty simple, but having NOW this NOW strategy to help consumers with a super easy on, you know, it's all there in a prepaid market.\nBut the main strategy has always been to have the superior product in the market with fantastic service and constant innovation, and do it in a capital way where our investment is consistent and within the guidelines that we previously talked about. All that's happening, and we're making great inroads on that.\nAnd if I had to pick one number this quarter that excites me, it was a double-digit growth of bits per home, which is, you know, showing that usage for whatever it is, gaming, you know, multi streams, whatever, and then the actual high definition becoming even higher definition over time with the quality of the pictures. So hopefully all that's useful, and we're pretty pleased with how the team's executing. Jason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, great, thanks. So just to round that out, Ben, just you think your question specifically on, you know, ARPU and how do you go through the ACP cycle and have confidence in ARPU growth? I think all these points relevant and valid, you know, number one, we continue to see usage grow at a rapid rate. So the value that the consumer is getting is higher. That's a tailwind in general for ARPU growth. I think number two is segmentation that Dave's talked about.\nWe see a lot of competition in a certain segment of our base, the value conscious segment of our base. But certainly segmentation allows you to keep that from seeping into other segments of the base, and the team's done a nice job executing there.\nFinal thing I'd point out is, as we said, ACP customers have got about 1.4 million in our base that we'll need to manage through. This is very similar, though, to if you think about how this business is wired. Dave and his team, it's promotional roll offs. This is something we're dealing with every single quarter. How do you navigate a base of customers that's on promotion and roll them into new rate plans and, you know, you keep them as customers.\nSo this is very much what the cable business is wired to do. On buyback spend, I would go back and over the last few years we've had a very consistent capital allocation strategy, starting with reinvesting in our business, layered into protecting the balance sheet. We really like our current credit rating and have committed to metrics that are associated with the credit rating.\nAs you've seen and as you point out, very strong free cash flow last year and expectation for similar this year, as you mentioned, allows for substantial share repurchase activity. So since we restarted the buyback in 2021, we bought back over 15% of our share count. If you look at the last year, we bought back over 6% of our share count. So both very strong metrics. I would point out the tail end of last year. We were pretty clear in the third quarter that we were going to accelerate the buyback, anticipating minimum floor Hulu proceeds, which came in at the very end of last year, and that's in advance of more full proceeds for full value this year. But we did get a minimum floor payment last year and hence accelerated the buyback in Q3 and Q4 to $3.5 billion.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nMike, Ben, I'll just come in on the back of the question about any changes in how we think about capital allocation. I think Jason and team are carrying on a phenomenal tradition. I've been here now close to 10 years, and I think the idea of taking our well generated capital across our businesses and first and foremost investing them back in the business with a very long term view of what the future can be, where there's expected return, whether that's the parks business, whether that's the broadband network, whether that's streaming, whether it's just broad innovation. I think it's in our DNA at this place to try to figure out ways to invest wisely for the future while at the same time maintaining a very strong balance sheet. We like the way the balance sheet is set up.\nWhen you go through these long, you know, long arcs of change across industries with disruption, it allows you to sleep better at night knowing the strength of balance sheet we have and allows it to continue making those earlier investments. And then, so to do those two things together with the very substantial interest on the part of the management team, and you know the facts that we've done it to just get lots of capital returned to shareholders. Not many companies are inclined to manage those three priorities as much as we are. And I can commit that that's where our head is as we look forward to the next 10 years ahead.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator. We're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is coming from Craig Moffitt from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, two questions about broadband, if I could. First you talked about how your broadband business, sorry, your wireless business is helping broadband churn. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that.\nFirst, can you put some numbers around the churn reduction that you see when a customer bundles broadband and wireless together? But more importantly, how do you think about wireless? Is it a standalone business to you or is it really in service of broadband churn? And then I wonder if you could maybe, I missed it, but Jason, I think you mentioned the margins for this domestic cable only business, but I think I may have missed the number. I wonder if you could just repeat that for us. Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey Craig, Dave, let me start with.\nWireless is an absolute integral part of our overall strategy. Specifically to your question, we've always thought the main value for us wireless is connected with broadband and that it adds, it surrounds broadband with value.\nI think we don't give specifics on exactly the churn benefits, but we do see it. Whether it's acquisition oriented, connected to broadband, whether it's base management, upgrading, whether it's retention, wireless plays a role in all of that. So it's a key growth opportunity. But it's also it's a product where our marginal economics are strong. So it's good to have that. The way we go to market, it's connected to broadband and it's connected to packaging, so it's performing well. You know, we like our consistency in the marketplace, and love the fact that we have a good runway ahead. You know, only about 11% penetrated now, you know, 7 million lines. So really like the opportunity in front of us.\nYou know, for us we've constantly been evolving our approach towards wireless and how we connect it with broadband and how we use it. So we have, for example, new pricing plans, our new mobile plans that are really targeting multi line customers. Excited about that, the new mobile product and the segmentation, we've already talked about that in the prepaid area, and for that segment we've had a buy one, get one program for the base.\nSo almost every single segment, and then just announced the WiFi Boost for our mobile customers. Being able to open up, you know, the public, the WiFi hotspots and open it up as fast as devices can go, and leveraging WiFi complement to mobile. So I think we've demonstrated that we're in this business, we love this business, and it's.\nBut it is definitely the core part of our strategy, is how it impacts broadband over the long run. Jason.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey Craig. So on margins, we said overall connectivity and platforms margins were up 50 basis points, and said domestic was an even greater increase. Domestic was up 70 basis points year over year. Sort of continuing the formula of a mix shift in our business to higher margin businesses. Our connectivity businesses are growing faster than our, our non growth video businesses. So that's a margin favorable trade off for us.\nAs well as said historically, and then operating efficiencies in the business. I think we gave a stat last call that I'd reiterate. You know, we've taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system in the last six years. We've taken 40% of customer interactions out of the system in the last six years. So a lot of good progress on expense efficiency. But Craig, the domestic margin is up 70 basis points.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nGot it. That helps. Thank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Craig. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Her line is now live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nExcuse me. Thank you. I have a question. On NBCU and also on Comcast cable on the theme parks, which is clearly one of your growth pillars, can you give us the investment levels you expect over the next five years? Obviously EPIC will be in there, so it will be a little elevated. But you have other new parks, and you're also investing in the existing parks. And how different is the return on invested capital for theme parks versus your other businesses?\nAnd then one more on NBCU: are there other areas NBCU should or you're thinking about investing in, like video games, and then on cable? On Comcast cable. Just a question. On your programming expense or programming contracts, presumably you have MSNs. I think you've always had them.\nHow should we think about the impact on Comcast Cable programming expenses as some major programming contracts come up with other distributors? Thank you.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey Jessica, it's Mike. So on parks, as we've said, this is a year in 2024 where CapEx in parks and at NBCUniversal overall will sustain at the level it was in 2023, so remain elevated in 2025. When we open Epic Universe, it will begin to step down, and then after that it will return to a more normal level with adjustments for the Hollywood Horror Nights and the kids park in Plano, Frisco, Texas that we've talked about. But those, as we've said, are not of the same size and scale as a large park like Epic Universe. So but we do have a bigger footprint of parks than we did say five years ago. So you're right. Part of the, part of the capital equation for parks is to continue to invest in new attractions within existing parks.\nSo again, once we get to 2026, you'll see us easing into a new steady state that does include, you know, continued experimentation with some of our alternative concepts, and then certainly we hope over the longer term to come up with some ideas for bigger deployments of capital. But that's what we have.\nIn our plans as we sit here right now. But we love the business, and to the question of returns, we think the returns are very strong.\nWe take a careful look at that every time we're greenlighting a new theme park. I think we like the stability of the long-term nature of the return. It's us and, you know, one other great company that are world leaders in.\nThat level of park experience.\nThe response to our parks has been phenomenal. You know, coming out of COVID, and so we see that being a place live entertainment at the level we're talking about being just a strong pillar of the media and entertainment side of the company for a long time ahead.\nThen in terms of, you know, other areas, I think the success that we've had across parks and experiences.\nAre.\nYou know, lead us to plenty of opportunities to think about gaming and other areas around live entertainment that go around and cross between our businesses. So we experiment with things and we look and it's our job to, to see if there are great opportunities to do that. But nothing to report today.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey Jessica.\nDave, just so in your question on renewals and our point of view. Yeah, look, there's, from our view, there's not a single approach towards. We handle it on a case-by-case basis. When you step back for a second though, we evaluate each one in three primary areas: one, the overall cost relative to the content, flexibility that's required in a very fast-changing environment, and the overall consumer value.\nAnd so, you know, and we're going to look at this significant transition that has been going on will continue to go on between linear and streaming. And so that is something that we think we can play a unique role in in terms of win-win opportunities between the content providers and distribution. And for us, we have a unique platform that is positioned well to be able to do handle everything that video can handle.\nLinear channels on demand, DVR, and streaming. We've been doing streaming packaging on the platform for some period of time so we can build bridges as these things come up. But our goal consistently has been to find win-win opportunities as we examine each and every specific renewal. But that's how we'll evaluate each one.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator. We're ready for the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat.\nGood morning, guys. Two, if I could maybe, maybe first for Jason, just finishing up on ACP. Given the strong start you guys had to the year and the strong ARPU, do you guys think that you can keep domestic cable EBITDA flat to up for the year even with ACP going away? That's first. I mean, maybe for Dave. The wireless companies are definitely talking a sort of bigger game on fixed wireless in the business market. And then you guys had some sort of strong comments in the prepared remarks about the business market. But are you starting to see some increasing competition leak in at the low end because of fixed wireless? Thanks.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, John, let me hit domestic or cable, EBITDA, cmp, EBITDA over the course of the year. So I think as you mentioned, it's competitive market. We've got ACP coming our way. At the same time, the balance, you know, think about broadband specifically the balance between rate and volume. We've seen, you know, obviously a little bit of pressure on volume, but 4.2% ARPU growth in the quarter, an outlook for, you know, we continue to stay to 3 to 4% during the year.\nSo we still think there's, there's tailwinds for broadband revenue growth. We had 3.9% this quarter. We're growing business services, we're growing wireless, and you know, we're offsetting video and other revenue declines. But at the total level, that's a margin accretive mix shift.\nI'd go back to what I've said before on some of the expense initiatives across the company, and being very disciplined, taking volumes out of the system, and that providing a tailwind as well. So without giving specific guidance for EBITDA growth, I would give you the components and our confidence in them.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nJohn. Dave, so just a follow-on to Jason's point in terms of ACP. Remember, I think a really important point, we've been segmenting the marketplace, and I think we've had the industry-leading platform in terms of Internet Essentials for a very long time, so decade-plus. So we are familiar with the segmentation in this area, and we're very familiar in terms of promo roles and bigger moments like this.\nSo because of that, in particular the ARPU point that's connected to it is, you know, we feel, you know, pretty good about the historical range of 3% to 4%. But we've had a longstanding approach towards this. On your question around business services, there's no question, John, that we, the SMB market has become, you know, a bit more competitive, and fixed wireless is a part of that. So they are.\nYou've seen it in the results. We now have three fixed wireless competitors that are in it. When you have that much all at once, there's some impact. So we're seeing it in SMB. It's unique to SMB, but our game plan consistently has been to focus on both the share and the overall the rate. And we have a great slate of products. We have multiple segments within business services, mid market, and enterprise that offset a lot of this and great product roadmaps that have.\nBut a really important point, as you feel competitive pressure, I think it's important to keep in mind, uniquely to SMB, is that reliability and ubiquity of our products and business services is really key here for businesses 24/7; they're always on, it has to work.\nI think over time we will continue to press that point, and we're not going to chase things down to zero in terms of discounting. We're going to offer better products and surround those products with features that makes sense for business customers. But we will make sure that customers know the reliability and ubiquity of what we do is unique and different than fixed wireless.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and, CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nJust Brian, just again, just as we.\nTalked about in the residential market, the long-term opportunity, where we're only just getting started, is that large enterprise and medium-sized business. And as you think about cybersecurity and other data reliability, and just consumption behavior of businesses, and think of your own businesses and where that might lead to, and the use of, you know, new tools and video and everything else, you want to have the best network. And once again we have a really exciting team and roadmap on that front. So again we're battling the reality in one segment with great opportunity in others, and long-term, love our situation.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you. Thank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. Maybe first just on broadband trends, I think you've been pursuing a line extension strategy for at least 18 months, and that'll continue. Is it correct to assume that your gross adds on broadband are starting to pick up just as you add more passings in the market? And if that's true, can you give us any color on within the deactivations where they're headed?\nI think you've always said that you view fiber as the bigger competitive threat, and so does that kind of help us understand what's going on between gross adds and net adds? Then separately on Peacock, you talked about retaining subs between some of your big marquee sporting events, and you've got a lot of great film on Peacock as well.\nI'm wondering what your tolerance is for original content and original content spend, and how we think about originals on Peacock, maybe vis-à-vis a long-term breakeven goal. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable",
    "content2": "Stephen, this is Dave. Let me start with footprint and then go to competition views. So let me, in terms of overall footprint expansion, you know, the vast majority of our new passings each quarter are fill-ins within our existing footprint. The balance of the growth is mostly from our organic edge-outs into adjacent areas, and so, with some government-subsidized builds representing a much smaller, albeit increasing, portion.\nSo it's really the kind of three different components of it that we're looking at. And so it's still early, but we are very disciplined. We evaluate the risk-adjusted returns of each one of these network builds on a case-by-case basis. And generally, though, the edge-outs, as that will increase, they're adjacent, sometimes located in between geographic markets that we currently serve.\nSo looking ahead, we expect these edge out projects to continue to contribute to the future growth in our total passings. We don't give to your question those specific numbers on this. I can tell you that, you know, we're going to reach very healthy penetration levels in a few years on these edge out projects. So the ramp ups happen, you know, pretty quickly, and we're pleased with the returns though. So pretty disciplined process. We looked on the returns, and then as you shift towards the competition.\nThe environment. Let me back up and just overall, it's a very intense competitive environment that is very consistent, the last several years, and so it picked up a bit. And when you have, again, three.\nFixed wireless competitors coming in pretty much at the same time, and you have the fiber level. About half of our footprint now has fiber competition of some form, and it's an intense competitive environment. But.\nWe have adjusted. We've been going up against fiber competition now for over 15 years. We've made adjustments. We've done, I think, very well in going toe to toe, exactly as Brian laid it out, that our long-term game plan is to focus on a better network, ubiquitous network, better products, surround it with the full portfolio of better products, and not chase units just for the sake of it. We've had moments going up against fiber where they've gone way down market.\nThey've become rational. We've had different cycles, and so I think we've made adjustments, and we have proven that we more than hold our own in that footprint. What we're seeing now is kind of an intense, more intense, competitive focus around the lower end of the market. That's why we're segmenting. That's why we're doing what we're doing.\nNever losing sight, though, that we're going to have a better product than anybody in the marketplace, the better network, and backing it up with better devices that can eventually as we get to multi-gig symmetrical. And that's the key. Every single application ubiquitously delivered, that's our focus. So it's, you know, it's a tough competitive environment, but I think we have a unique differentiated approach.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nOn Peacock, I mean we're very pleased as both Jason and I said earlier, you know, with a quarter where we ended at 33.5 million subs, three and a half years in. We are at a place now where we really are seeing traction in our approach to providing a service for consumers that is a combination of both entertainment and sports, and how those two go together. Very much a reflection, as we said from the beginning of our, a mirror image of what we see as our strengths at NBCUniversal itself. When you look at this quarter in particular, you end up with a.\nStart with a wild card game that brought in a tremendous number of subs ahead of where we expected it to be, and then retention that was ahead of where we expected it to be. So that's obviously great, and the power of sports to bring audiences together, and we'll stay committed because of our strength in sports. But when you really reflect on what then happened in the weeks that followed, our viewing was at record highs across all parts of our non-sports portfolio.\nIn fact, in the quarter, we launched our biggest original Ted to the greatest success of any of the originals we've ever launched. And The Traitors 2, our reality series on Peacock, both of those were in the Nielsen top 10 streaming in the earlier part of the year.\nSo I think we see the two, you know, the parts of the portfolio interplaying well with each other. And obviously the strength of our movie studio, which we talked about earlier with Oppenheimer and Holdovers and now coming up in future quarters, Kung Fu Panda 4. That is another great source of strength into our portfolio. So I think you can expect to see us having a very broad approach to its sports, its originals, its next day airing of NBC content. It's our library, and it's our Pay one movies. All those things going into a service that we think is one of the best values in streaming and a very distinct place over time in the streaming marketplace for consumers. And when you look ahead from where we started the year we are now in, continue to focus hard on retaining the growth in subs we had.\nSecond quarter will be a little lighter in terms of the cadence of our content. But when you look to the middle of the year, we've got Olympics. Right after that, we've got the return of NFL, Big Ten, and our exclusive NFL game in Sao Paulo, Brazil, along with the tremendous movie slate, The Fall Guy, Twisters, Despicable Me 4, in addition to Kung Fu Panda 4. So we feel great about what we're doing and the progress we're making. It's very consistent with the way we've described Peacock as taking advantage of what makes us great at NBCUniversal to begin with and taking our existing strengths and assets into a digital future. So that's. It's one of our six big growth drivers. Glad to get a chance to comment on it. Thank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nThanks. One for Dave and one for Jason. Dave, taking a step back from the sort of the increased competitive intensity you're seeing in the broadband market, I would love your perspectives on how the overall market is trending. As we tally up all the ads in the quarter, it looks like we're sort of trending to somewhere around half of what we normally see for the industry in the first quarter.\nEverybody's ads are down, and I'm wondering if you've got any thoughts as to what might be driving that. Then, Jason, on the segmentation strategy, you hit the low end of the market with some offers last year and then pulled back because you were worried about cannibalization. I'm wondering how the NOW you sort of structured NOW differently so you don't end up seeing that cannibalization impact. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Jonathan. Dave. Let me start with the broadband in its entirety, the whole market and a viewpoint. So let me begin with the broadband market as a whole is still growing, maybe at a slower pace than it was last year and the year before, but there's still going to be a pretty healthy amount of net adds in 2024 and likely beyond. The right way, though, in addition to that, I think you got everything we've talked about before. The right way we think to look about it is it's, you know, holding our own growing relationships responsibly, but it's also where the market is going and how broadband is being used and that, as we talked about, the utility of the broadband product itself is only going up.\nSo when you look at the health of the entire category, it's the relationships, but it's also the overall usage and consumption. And for us, you've seen usage is up double digits. Broadband only subs using over 700 GB of data a month, over 70% of our subscriber base is on speed tiers of 50 megs or more, and nearly 1/3 of our customers are on a gig. Those are great trends for us over the long term and gives us the great confidence as we're investing, continuing to invest in a better network and a better customer experience, as Brian has said.\nSo when you look at things, I think it's clearly competitive. As we've talked about, one other factor that enters into it in some cases, in certain segments, there's some people that revert back to mobile. Only that can happen.\nSo there's a variety of factors that could enter into it, but overall as a category and a growth opportunity, quite optimistic about broadband.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey, Jonathan, let me start on segmentation and Dave probably wants to chime in as well. So on NOW, I think what's interesting and exciting about it is it's a dedicated sort of flanker brand strategy. We've had prepaid offers in the past sort of wedged into our existing portfolio. This is a more dedicated and branded strategy around it that, by the way, the branding around this has worked very well in our UK market.\nFor Sky, it's actually where the brand name came from and, you know, so we expect this to have some resonance. I would point out that if you look at where it's sort of targeted, we've got a 100 meg offer for $30. It's inclusive of taxes, fees, and equipment. We've got a $45 offering that's 200 megs and inclusive as well. Very competitive versus fixed wireless. Right.\nThat is in this range, maybe slightly higher without the same reliability and ubiquity that we have.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYeah, adding on to that, Jonathan, but you know, again, we've been doing prepaid broadband for a while, years and.\nWe.\nNeeded to refresh it, needed to update it and put it in a more competitive position. The prepaid mobile is new and NOW TV is relatively new, but it's a segmented approach and if you think about it, it's all in pricing. It's very simple, it's really easy. There's no contracts, no credit checks, customers can sign up, pause, cancel, online, anytime. It's very straightforward.\nFuture light product. As we keep our focus on the high end in terms of fully featured things, we'll continue to do that, but this just gives us a brand, gives us a product suite to be able to clearly and define segmentation in a way that we can manage through.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Jonathan. We want to thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes the question and answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast's first quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanaugh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our investor relations website, and which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Across the company, our team is managing extremely well in a highly competitive and evolving marketplace. We have a clear vision for how we are going to compete now and into the future, combined with a sharp focus on execution. Equally important, our disciplined capital allocation strategy coupled with our strong balance sheet puts us in an enviable position relative to our peers to invest organically and aggressively in our six scaled and diverse growth businesses, namely residential broadband, wireless business services, theme parks, studios, and streaming. These businesses comprise more than 55% of the company's total revenue today, and that proportion will only grow over time.\nIn the first quarter, these businesses generated a high single-digit increase in revenue on a trailing twelve-month basis, and when combined with our substantial share repurchase activity, enabled us to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth as well as significant growth in free cash flow per share. In fact, since 2018, we grew adjusted EPS over 50% and free cash flow per share nearly 25%. Now for some of the highlights of the first quarter, I'll start with broadband. The broadband market remains extremely competitive, particularly within the market for more price-conscious consumers. We continue to be intensely focused on segmentation, providing customers with options that meet both their lifestyle and budget.\nImportantly, we are striking the right balance between ARPU and subscribers, which is clearly reflected in our Q1 results where despite modest subscriber losses, ARPU grew over 4%, driving mid single digit growth in residential broadband revenue to over $6.5 billion. We continue to see extremely encouraging broadband consumption trends across our base of 32 million customers.\nUsage on our network rose double digits year over year with broadband only households consuming over 700 GB of data each month, and our broadband customers continue to value faster speeds. Today over 70% of our residential subscribers receive speeds of 500 Mbps or higher, and around 1/3 are getting a gig or more. We believe that consumers expectations for their broadband experience in terms of speed, reliability, security, and performance will only increase over time. It is extremely important to us that our network upgrades stay well ahead of this demand.\nOur deployment of Mid-splits doubled year over year and now reach 40% of the footprint. The investments we are making to increase capacity and incorporate multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds everywhere we offer service put us in a great position to capitalize on these very favorable consumer trends, and when combined with our rapid footprint expansion set us up to gain market share and return to broadband subscriber growth over time.\nTurning to wireless, we increased our domestic customer lines by 21% year over year to nearly 7 million. Yet with wireless penetration of our residential broadband customer base still only 11%, we have plenty of room to grow. We continue to see the benefit of bundling broadband and mobile which decreases churn and improves customer lifetime value. Our customers also benefit by being connected to our WiFi network, which is the largest in the nation.\nIn fact, 90% of all Xfinity Mobile traffic is delivered over WiFi, not cellular, and we are constantly adding new features to further differentiate the experience. The most recent example is our introduction of WiFi Boost, which enables any Xfinity Mobile customer to experience speeds of up to a gig whenever they connect to our 23 million hotspots at no additional cost.\nAcross our connectivity and platforms business, we're focused on profitably serving each segment of the market from our premium and traditional customers who want fully featured products to more price-driven consumers. With regard to the latter, we are introducing NOW, a new brand and product portfolio targeting the prepaid market that delivers high-quality, low-cost internet, mobile, and streaming TV products with simple all-in pricing.\nNOW Internet and mobile will be particularly helpful to those Americans impacted by the end of ACP, bringing them another option for affordable, reliable connectivity and supplementing our Internet Essentials program, which we offer to eligible households as part of our long-standing commitment to help close the digital divide in America. Turning to Content and Experiences, let's start with Parks.\nWe continue to see strong underlying demand in both Hollywood and Japan, where healthy attendance and per cap levels were once again driven by the success of Super Nintendo World. Building on our momentum later this year, we're opening our newest Nintendo-themed land, Donkey Kong Country, which will increase the size of Super Nintendo World in Japan by 70%.\nSwitching gears to Orlando, we started to feel some pressure on attendance levels late in the first quarter, which tends to occur in tandem with the ebbs and flows of new attractions in the market. Right now we happen to be lapping the multi-year surge in attendance from our opening of new attractions in prior periods, but we remain confident about our longer-term growth opportunities, especially as we look ahead to next year with the opening of Epic Universe.\nWith three new hotels and five immersive worlds featuring more than 50 attractions, entertainment, dining, and shopping experiences, it will be the most technologically advanced park in the world. Together with our three current gates in Orlando, Epic will enable us to offer a full week's vacation experience to even more guests.\nMoving to Studios, we're incredibly proud of our film team and our recent ranking as the number one global studio by worldwide box office and winner of eight Academy Awards, including best picture for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, on the back of our fantastic performance in 2023. The power of our studios continued this quarter with the theatrical release of Kung Fu Panda 4, which has grossed over $480 million in worldwide box office to date, and we have an exciting slate still ahead.\nFor the third year in a row, we will release more movies than any other major studio, with The Fall Guy, an action thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, coming this May, Despicable Me 4, Illumination's newest installment of the highest grossing animated franchise, as well as our adaptation of Twisters, both debuting in July, and Wicked, one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2024, coming in November.\nFinally, in media, we are successfully managing the segment as one business across linear and streaming by providing the tens of millions of traditional pay TV subscribers, as well as streamers, with choice in how they engage with us. We continue to generate significant audience for our programming, big events like the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, Big Ten, top entertainment shows like Saturday Night Live, and Law & Order.\nWith strong consumer demand for our content, we're well positioned to evolve with the changing market. Our exclusively streamed NFL Wild Card game was a big success this past quarter. We added and then retained even more new Peacock subscribers than we expected. Overall, people are staying with us to engage in a broad range of content, spending 90% of their time on the platform viewing non-sports programming.\nThis includes scripted shows like Ted and reality shows like The Traitors, both of which ranked within Nielsen's streaming top 10, and our award-winning collection of films like Oppenheimer, which premiered exclusively on Peacock in February and was the most watched film across all streaming in its first seven days on the platform. Clearly, Peacock has been on a great trajectory since our launch four years ago.\nWe're at 34 million paid subscribers, having grown 12 million year over year and at a $10 ARPU. Looking ahead, our content offering provides such a great value proposition that we should have some real pricing power over time. Of course, sports also play an important role in our media business, and that's especially true this year. Following the Kentucky Derby in May, we'll have the Paris Olympics for 17 nights this summer with more programming hours on the NBC Broadcast Network than any previous Olympics and over 5,000 hours of live coverage on Peacock.\nThe Games are on track to generate the most advertising revenue in history with $1.2 billion in ad sales commitments. Right after the Olympics, we have the return of football with Big Ten, Sunday Night Football, and the NFL's first ever Friday Night opening game from Sao Paulo streaming exclusively on Peacock.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSo wrapping up, I am really proud of the work that our teams across the company are doing together. We're executing at the highest level and positioning ourselves for growth in a challenging and dynamic marketplace. So Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Mike and good morning everyone. I'll start with our consolidated results on slide 4. Total revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion and within this, our six major growth drivers generated nearly $17 billion in revenue, well over half of total company revenue, and once again have shown steady and consistent growth at a high single digit rate over the past 12 months.\nWhile EBITDA was in line with prior year's level at $9.4 billion, we generated a high level of free cash flow this quarter at $4.5 billion and we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases. Over the last 12 months we have reduced our share count by nearly 6%, contributing to our Adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 14%. Now let's go through our business results starting on slide 5 with connectivity and platforms.\nNote that our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British pound, which was up 4% year over year. So as usual, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the connectivity and platforms business, I will refer to year over year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in connectivity revenues, offset mainly by declines in video revenue.\nResidential connectivity revenue grew 7%, driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 13% growth in domestic wireless, and 19% growth in international connectivity, while business services connectivity revenue grew 5% in domestic broadband. Our revenue growth was driven by very strong ARPU, which increased 4.2% and came in a bit above our historical range.\nOur team is doing an excellent job of customer segmentation while balancing rate and volume, and we are encouraged by the positive consumer behavior trends we see in our base of 32 million customers. Bandwidth requirements and engagement are increasing at a rapid clip, while the vast majority of our customers are now on speeds of 500 megabits or higher and adopting advanced tiers of service like XFI Complete at a higher rate. But as Mike mentioned, it continues to be a very competitive environment and we lost 65,000 subscribers in Q1 following the loss of 34,000 subscribers in Q4 2023.\nAs we sit here right now, we do not see this trend improving in the near term. We expect churn could be elevated given the end of ACP, which is only fully funded through April and partially funded through May.\nWe remain in constant communication with our ACP customers and will continue to be diligent in helping this customer segment stay connected through various options, whether that's our successful Internet Essentials program or our new prepaid NOW offerings as Mike described. In addition, I want to remind you that Q2 also tends to experience seasonal headwinds. While it's a competitive market, especially for the price-driven segment, we will continue to compete aggressively yet in a financially balanced way and expect to drive healthy broadband revenue growth through growth in ARPU, which we expect to remain well within our historical range of 3% to 4% growth even as we manage through the ACP transition.\nTurning to domestic wireless, revenue growth of 13% was due to higher service revenue driven by a 21% year-over-year increase in our customer lines, ending the quarter at 6.9 million in total, including the 289,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We are consistently in the marketplace testing new offers, including some recent new pricing plans targeted at multi-line customers, the new NOW Mobile product, as well as our buy one get one line offer.\nWe continue to see significant opportunity in wireless to increase the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 11%, and to sell additional lines per account. International connectivity revenue reflects strong growth in broadband revenue driven by solid ARPU growth as well as growth in wireless due to additional customer lines and also higher ARPU for business services connectivity.\nWe generated 5% revenue growth driven by higher ARPU in small business and broader growth in both customers and additional solutions for mid-market and enterprise. The SMB market has gotten more competitive, but we'll aggressively defend our position and similar to this quarter, we'll grow revenue by increasing ARPU driven by higher adoption of additional products like Mobile Security, Edge Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro and through targeted rate opportunities.\nMeanwhile, our momentum continues to build in mid-market and enterprise as our expanding capabilities in managed services, wide-area networking, and cybersecurity have led to increasing customer wins and the expansion of existing relationships. The strong growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by a decline in video and other revenue.\nThe decline in our video revenue was driven by continued customer losses and slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower other revenue reflects continued customer losses in wireline voice. As I mentioned earlier, Connectivity & Platforms total EBITDA increased 1.3% with margin of 50 basis points reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses combined with a continued focus on expense management. While margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved even more. Our international business was impacted by a reclassification of some expense from capitalized software to operating expenses, creating a tough comparison to last year. We will see a similar trend until we start to lap this change at the end of this year.\nI'll note that absent this change, EBITDA growth in the first quarter would have been about a point higher and our margin improvement would have been about 50 basis points higher. While this change increased our operating expenses this quarter, there was an offsetting decline in connectivity and platforms capital resulting in a neutral impact on net cash flow, which was up 5% this quarter.\nBreaking out our connectivity and platforms EBITDA results further, residential EBITDA grew 1.1% with margins improving 60 basis points to 38.3%, and business services EBITDA growth was lower than our typical mid single digit level at 2.6% with margins declining 160 basis points to 56.7%. These results include significant investments in the enterprise space including in sales and fulfillment that we are making to drive future revenue growth.\nBusiness services generates well over $5 billion in annual EBITDA, which is margin accretive, and we expect it to continue to be a material contributor to overall connectivity and platforms growth this year and over the longer term. Now let's turn to content and experiences on slide 6. Overall revenue increased 1% to $10.4 billion and EBITDA decreased 7% to $1.5 billion. Let's take a closer look at the details, starting with theme parks.\nRevenue increased 2% while EBITDA decreased 4% for the quarter. These results reflect the negative impact of currency as the Japanese yen is at a 34-year low against the dollar. Adjusting the results to exclude the impact of foreign currency, park's revenue would have increased 5% and EBITDA would have been flat compared to last year's first quarter.\nWe had strong underlying growth at our park in Osaka, which continues to benefit from demand for Super Nintendo World. We're also seeing growth in Hollywood despite lapping the opening of Super Nintendo World in that park during the quarter. Beijing results were relatively flat in what is typically a seasonally light quarter, and Orlando results were below last year but still roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nWe are seeing some pullback from the unprecedented attendance we realized immediately after the pandemic, which we believe is driven by the timing of new attraction openings and some increased competition from other entertainment venues, notably cruises and media, which includes our TV networks and Peacock. Revenue increased 4% as Peacock's strong growth of 54% more than offset a low single digit decline at our linear networks.\nDistribution revenue growth of 7% was driven by Peacock, with subscription revenue growth of 68% powered by the 55% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 34 million, including 3 million net adds in the first quarter. We are really pleased with Peacock's trajectory. We started the year with an incredibly successful NFL Wild Card game, which resulted in a nice lift to paid subs. But even more important was how our broad content offering enabled strong consumer acquisition, retention, and engagement.\nWe've had success across a broad range of content during the quarter, including films moving into our Pay 1 window, like Oppenheimer, the most watched Pay 1 film in Peacock's history, and The Holdovers, as well as successful originals including Apples Never Fall, Ted, and the second season of The Traitors.\nLooking ahead, we'll continue to be focused on retention, particularly in Q2 as we look forward to second half where we have a substantial amount of acquisition oriented content lined up. This is consistent with Peacock's historical trends and this year is expected to be driven by the Olympics this summer, the NFL, and Big Ten returning in the fall in addition to the steady stream of films landing on our Pay 1 window as well as upcoming originals. Finally, domestic advertising revenue was flat in the quarter reflecting a stable overall market with strong advertising growth at Peacock offset by lower advertising revenue at our Linear Networks.\nMedia EBITDA decreased 6%, reflecting the revenue pressure on our linear networks, partially offset by continued year-over-year improvement in Peacock EBITDA losses, even with the addition of the Wildcard rights costs, and we expect to see, on average, even better year-over-year improvement for Peacock in the coming quarters.\nAt Studios, the revenue decline of 7% reflects lower content licensing, which was impacted by the timing of deliverables related to our film licensing business, which was partially offset by a modest increase in theatrical revenue driven by the strong performance of Kung Fu Panda 4 at the box office. This quarter, Studios EBITDA declined 12% reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's film slate including the highly successful carryover title Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and the timing of licensing deals at film now.\nI'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow this quarter and we achieved this even with the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers, specifically our $3.3 billion in total capital spending.\nThis quarter incorporates our efforts in expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business, and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe theme park ahead of its 2025 opening, and working capital was a $940 million drag for the quarter, a significant improvement over last year, a lot of which is timing related.\nTurning to return of capital for the quarter, we returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders, an increase of 13% year over year. This includes share repurchases of $2.4 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. Putting it all together, in the last 12 months, we've returned over $16 billion in capital to shareholders between share repurchases and dividends, reducing our share count by nearly 6%. At the same time, we invested nearly $17 billion back into our businesses in the form of capital and working capital, carefully and consistently balancing reinvesting in our businesses for growth, returning significant capital to shareholders, and doing so with a very strong balance sheet which facilitates this consistency through a variety of operating environments. Now let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open up the call for Q and A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press Star, then the number one on your touchtone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press Star, then the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, press Star, then the number one on your touchtone phone. Our first question today is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Two questions maybe for Dave on the cable side. Could you talk maybe bigger picture about customer segmentation, particularly some of the new efforts around prepaid and the NOW brand, as well as some of the speed boosts you've done, and just how you think about that impacting the business over time? And then if you're willing to give us a little more on how you are able to deliver ARPU growth within the historical range through this ACP transition, just given obviously these subsidies going away.\nAnd then I think for Jason, we expect EBITDA growth this year, free cash flow growth this year. You guys had a nice free cash flow first quarter. I guess I would have expected buybacks to grow as well, year on year.\nAs you point out on that last slide, trailing twelve months, $11.5 billion, $2.5 billion in the first quarter. It looks like it's slowing a bit. I just wonder if you could comment if there's anything that's changed on sort of the capital allocation leverage math that we should be thinking about with Comcast this year. Thanks, everyone.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Ben, Dave. So let me start with segmentation and a little bit more context on NOW. So stepping back, our segmentation strategy is really key, starts with, though, the beginning point always for us is premium and traditional broadband customers. We've, you know, focused there and invested in terms of better network, better products around providing a better service for the premium segment.\nWe have, though, consistently competed for, you know, all segments, and as we break it down, you know, we've focused where we think the main point is where broadband's going, and broadband's going is the engagement. And so our focus is to continue to deliver multi-gig symmetrical and build towards that point. So and do this for a variety of internet options.\nThe proof is in the pudding in terms of segmentation in that 70% of our HSD only customers receive speeds of 500 Mbps or higher, and 1/3 of our customers, RESI customers, receive gig plus. It never has been one size fits all. Start there in the focus of premium. But there is currently a lot of activity at the low end of the market, and we've not been as competitive in this space. We've had great products.\nSeveral options, but we, in the prepaid area in particular, believe there is an opportunity to improve our effectiveness there. So thus NOW and NOW there are three components of NOW. One is prepaid broadband, which, by the way, we've had.\nPrepaid broadband for some time. We've just improved upon the value proposition there. So it's our new prepaid broadband update. And second, we have prepaid NOW Mobile which is new, and then feel that it's positioned as an alternative to fixed wireless, and that just a lot of activity there. The focus there is no credit checks, it's easy, it's no contract, and on an everyday price point. So not a lot of movement in terms of just a competitive value-based price point. So.\nAt the time, you know, we're doing now, obviously this is a good alternative to ACP, and where that goes is too early to talk about any progress, but we're real pleased with the positioning of the NOW product for the income constrained segment of the market. We've had NOW TV for some time and traction there. So it's a standalone product suite. I feel very good about that on ARPU.\nYou know, this is a strength that we've had. We've been balancing ARPU growth along with share volume for a very long time. So feel good about this quarter came in very strong at 4.2%, a bit above the historical 3% to 4% range. You know, it's a very competitive marketplace, to say the least. And we're just striking the right balance we think in volume and rate, and our approach is, you know, reasonable rate increase.\nThe teams have managed this well, leading to rate yield results that exceeded our expectations a bit. But also goes back to the first point. You know, we're segmenting the marketplace and tailoring product approaches that meet each, you know, specific segment. So starts with the high end that I've talked about and very focused there and the results that I've talked about. So that's the starting point.\nBut when you look at our long-standing approach to pricing and packaging, you know we're going to compete for every segment, and it's really focused though where the market's going and making sure that in the long run as the overall usage goes up, and to me that that is the main point, you have double-digit increases in terms of overall broadband consumption, you have lots of customers, a lot of interest in our high-end of our portfolio, and strength in a ubiquitous, reliable, great network that can stand up for every segment but power through every application that is there.\nSo I think, you know, for us, you know, pleased with ARPU, and I think we can, you know, muscle through this ACP thing and feel good about the guidance that we've been giving that 3% to 4% historical range.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and, CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThis is Brian.\nI just want to underscore that.\nLast point that Dave was making. As you look with a longer lens, which I hope the company tries to do.\nYou know, we just.\nEven yesterday we're looking at our technology roadmap internally and seeing some demonstrations of innovation. It's inspiring and exciting to think about what broadband will actually help you do in the next five, 10, 10 years as a consumer and as a business. It's kind of in some levels unimaginable. A lot of discussion about AI, but so much happening in the entertainment sector, sports sector, and also in the healthcare sector and then things we're not even talking about. So our strategy is pretty simple but having NOW this NOW strategy to help consumers with a super easy on. It's all there in a prepaid market.\nBut the main strategy has always been to have the superior product in the market with fantastic service and constant innovation, and do it in a capital way where our investment is consistent and within the guidelines that we've previously talked about. All that's happening, and we're making great inroads on that. And if I had to pick one number this quarter that excites me, it was double-digit growth of bits per home, which is, you know, showing that usage for whatever it is, gaming, you know, multi streams, whatever, and then the actual high definition becoming even higher definition over time with.\nThe quality of the pictures.\nSo hopefully all that's useful and we're pretty pleased with how the team's executing. Jason?\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYes, great, thanks.\nSo just to round that out, Ben, just you think your question specifically on ARPU and how do you go through the ACP cycle and have confidence in ARPU growth? I think all these points relevant and valid. Number one, we continue to see usage grow at a rapid rate, so the value that the consumer is getting is higher. That's a tailwind in general for ARPU growth\n. I think number two is segmentation that Dave's talked about. We see a lot of competition in a certain segment of our base, the value conscious segment of our base. But segmentation allows you to keep that from seeping into other segments of the base. And the team's done a nice job executing there. Final thing I'd point out is, as we said, ACP customers have got about 1.4 million in our base that we'll need to manage through.\nThis is very similar, though, to if you think about how this business is wired. Dave and his team, it's promotional roll offs. This is something we're dealing with every single quarter. How do you navigate a base of customers that's on promotion, promotion and roll them into new rate plans and, you know, keep them as customers? So this is very much what the cable business is wired to do. On buyback spend, I would go back and over the last few years we've had a very consistent capital allocation strategy, starting with reinvesting in our business, layered into protecting the balance sheet. We really like our current credit rating and have committed to metrics that are associated with the credit rating.\nAs you've seen and as you point out, very strong free cash flow last year and expectation for similar this year, as you mentioned, allows for substantial share repurchase activity. So since we restarted the buyback in 2021, we bought back over 15% of our share count. If you look at the last year, we bought back over 6% of our share count. So both very strong metrics.\nI would point out the tail end of last year. We were pretty clear in Q3 that we were going to extend, accelerate the buyback, anticipating minimum floor Hulu proceeds, which came in at the very end of last year, and that's in advance of more full proceeds for full value this year. But we did get a minimum floor payment last year and hence accelerated the buyback in Q3 and Q4 to $3.5 billion.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nMike. Ben, I'll just come in on the back of the question about any changes in how we think about capital allocation. I think Jason and team, you know, are carrying on a phenomenal tradition. I've been here now close to 10 years, and I think the idea of taking our well-generated capital across our businesses and first and foremost investing them back in the business with a very long-term view of what the future can be, where there's expected return, whether that's the parks business, whether that's the broadband network, whether that's streaming, whether it's just broad innovation.\nI think it's in our DNA at this place to try to figure out ways to invest wisely for the future while at the same time maintaining a very strong balance sheet. And we like the way the balance sheet is set up.\nWhen you go through these long, you know, long arcs of change across industries with disruption, it allows you to sleep better at night knowing the strength of balance sheet we have and allows it to continue making those earlier investments and then so to do those two things together with the very substantial interest on the part of the management team, and you know the facts that we've done it to just get lots of capital returned to shareholders. Not many companies are inclined to manage those three priorities as much as we are. I can commit that that's where our head is as we look forward to the next 10 years ahead.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, two questions about broadband, if I could. First, you talked about how your broadband business. Sorry, your wireless business is helping broadband churn. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that.\nFirst.\nCan you put some numbers around the churn reduction that you see when a customer bundles broadband and wireless together? But more importantly, how do you think about wireless? Is it a standalone business to you or is it really in service of broadband churn? And then I wonder if you could. Maybe I was just, I missed it. But Jason, I think you mentioned the.\nMargins for this domestic cable only business.\nBut I think I may have missed the number. I wonder if you could just repeat that for us. Thanks.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey Craig, Dave, let me start with.\nWireless, and then hand it over to Jason and folks, but let me. Wireless is an absolute integral part of our overall strategy. And specifically to your question, we've always thought the main value for us wireless is connected with broadband, and that it adds, it surrounds broadband with value.\nI think we don't give specifics on exactly the churn benefits, but we do see it, and whether it's acquisition oriented, connected to broadband, whether it's base management upgrading, whether it's retention, wireless plays a role in all of that. So it's a key growth opportunity. But it's also, it's a product where our marginal economics are strong, so it's good to have that. But the way we go to market, it's connecting to broadband, and it's connected to packaging, so it's performing well. You know, we like our consistency in the marketplace and love the fact that we have a good runway ahead. You know, only about 11% penetrated now, you know, seven million lines. And so really like the opportunity in front of us.\nYou know, for us we've constantly been evolving our approach towards wireless and how we connect it with broadband and how we use it. We have, for example, new pricing plans, our new mobile plans that are really targeting multi-line customers. Excited about that, the new mobile product and the segmentation, we've already talked about that in the prepaid area, and for that segment we've had a buy one, get one program for the base. Almost every single segment, and then just announced the WiFi Boost for our mobile customers. Being able to open up, you know, the public WiFi hotspots and open it up as fast as devices can go and leveraging WiFi complement to mobile.\nSo, I think we've demonstrated that we're in this business, we love this business, but it is definitely the core part of our strategy, how it impacts broadband over the long run. Jason.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey Craig. So on margins, we said overall connectivity and platforms margins were up 50 basis points, and said domestic was an even greater increase; domestic was up 70 basis points year over year. Sort of continuing the formula of a mix shift in our business to higher margin businesses. Our connectivity businesses are growing faster than our.\nNon-growth video businesses. So that's a margin-favorable trade-off for us, as we've said historically, and then operating efficiencies in the business. I think we gave a stat last call that I'd reiterate. You know, we've taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system in the last six years. We've taken 40% of customer interactions out of the system in the last six years. So a lot of good progress on expense efficiency. But Craig, the domestic margin is up 70 basis points.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nGot it. That helps, thanks.\nYou.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Craig. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly, our next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Her line is now live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nExcuse me. Thank you. I have a question on NBCU and also on Comcast Cable on the theme parks, which is clearly one of your growth pillars. Can you give us the investment levels you expect over the next five years? Obviously, EPIC will be in there, so it will be a little elevated. But you have other new parks, and you're also investing in the existing parks.\nAnd how different is the return on invested capital for theme parks versus your other businesses? And then one more on NBCU: are there other areas NBCU should or you're thinking about investing in, like video games? And then on cable, on Comcast Cable. Just a question. On your programming expense or programming contracts, presumably you have.\nI think you've always had them. How should we think about the impact on Comcast Cable programming expenses as some major programming contracts come up with other distributors? Thank you.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation",
    "content3": "Hey, Jessica, it's Mike. So on parks, as we've said, this is a year in 2024 where CapEx in parks and at NBCUniversal overall will sustain at the, at the level it was in 2023. So remain elevated. In 2025 when we open Epic, it will begin to step down, and then after that it will return to a more normal level with adjustments for the Hollywood Horror nights and the kids park in Plano, Frisco, Texas that we've talked about.\nBut those, as we've said, are not of the same size and scale as a large park like Epic. So but we do have a bigger footprint of parks than we did say five years ago. So you're right. Part of the, part of the capital equation for parks is to continue to invest in new attractions within existing parks.\nAgain, once we get to 2026, you'll see us easing into a new steady state that does include, you know, continued experimentation with some of our alternative concepts. Then certainly we hope over the longer term to come up with some ideas for bigger deployments of capital. That's what we have.\nIn our plans as we sit here right now. But we love the business, and to the question of returns, we think the returns are very strong.\nWe take a careful look at that every time we're green lighting, you know, a new park. I think we like the stability of the long term nature of the return. It's us and you know, one other great company that are world leaders in.\nThat level of park experience.\nThe response to our parks has been phenomenal. You know, coming out of COVID and so we see that being a place, live entertainment at the level we're talking about being just a strong park pillar of the media and entertainment side of the company for a long time ahead.\nAnd then in terms of, you know, other areas, I think the success that we've had across parks and experiences.\nAre.\nYou know, lead us to plenty of opportunities to think about gaming and other areas around live entertainment that go around and cross between our businesses. So we experiment with things and we look and it's our job to see if there are great opportunities to do that. But nothing to report today.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Jessica, Dave. Just so your question on renewals and our point of view. Yeah, look, there's, from our view, there's not a single approach towards, you know, we handle it on a case by case basis. When you step back for a second though, we evaluate each one in three primary areas. One, the overall cost relative to the content, flexibility that's required in a very fast changing environment, and the overall consumer value.\nAnd so you know, and we're going to look at this significant transition that has been going on, will continue to go on between linear and streaming. And so that is something that we think we can play a unique role in in terms of win-win opportunities between the content providers and distribution.\nAnd for us, we have a unique platform that is positioned well to be able to handle everything that video can handle, linear channels, on demand, DVR, and streaming. We've been doing streaming packaging on the platform for some period of time so we can build bridges as these things come up. But our goal consistently has been to find win-win opportunities as we examine each and every specific renewal. But that's how we'll evaluate each one.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, we're ready for the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live. Great.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, guys. Two, if I could maybe, maybe first for Jason, just finishing up on ACP. Given the strong start you guys had to the year and the strong ARPU, do you guys think that you can keep domestic cable EBITDA flat to up for the year even with ACP going away?\nThat's first, and maybe for Dave. The wireless companies are definitely talking a sort of bigger game on fixed wireless in the business market. And then you guys had some sort of strong comments in the prepared remarks about the business market. But are you starting to see some increasing competition leak in at the low end because of fixed wireless? Thanks.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, John, let me hit domestic or cable EBITDA, C and P EBITDA over the course of the year. So I think as you mentioned, it's competitive market, we've got ACP coming our way. At the same time, the balance, you know, think about broadband specifically the balance between rate and volume. We've seen, you know, obviously a little bit of pressure on volume, but 4.2% ARPU growth in the quarter.\nAn outlook for, you know, we continue to stay to 3% to 4% during the year. So we still think there's, there's tailwinds for broadband revenue growth. We had 3.9% this quarter. We're growing business services, we're growing wireless, and you know, offsetting video and other revenue declines. But at the total level, that's a margin accretive mix shift.\nI'd go back to what I've said before on some of the expense initiatives across the company, and being very disciplined, taking volumes out of the system, and that providing a tailwind as well. So without giving specific guidance for EBITDA growth, I would give you the components and our confidence in them.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, John. Dave. So just a follow on to Jason's point in terms of ACP. Remember, I think, a really important point: we've been segmenting the marketplace, and I think we've had the industry-leading platform in terms of Internet Essentials for a very long time, so a decade plus. So we are familiar with the segmentation in this area, and we're very familiar in terms of promo roles and bigger moments like this. So.\nBecause of that, in particular, the ARPU point that's connected to it is we feel pretty good about the historical range of 3% to 4%, but we've had a long-standing approach towards this. On your question around business services, there's no question, John, that the SMB market has become a bit more competitive and fixed wireless is a part of that. So they are.\nYou've seen it in the results. We now have, you know, three fixed wireless competitors that are in it. When you have that much all at once, there's some impact. So we're seeing it in SMB. It's unique to SMB. But you know, our game plan consistently has been to, you know, focus on both the share and the overall rate. And we have a great slate of products.\nWe have multiple segments within business services, mid-market, and enterprise that offset a lot of this and great product roadmaps that have. But a really important point, as you feel competitive pressure, I think it's important to keep in mind, uniquely to SMB, that reliability and ubiquity of our products and business services is really key here for businesses. They get 24/7, they're always on, it has to work.\nI think over time, you know, we will continue to press that point and you know, we're not going to chase things down to zero in terms of discounting. We're going to offer better products and surround those products with features that make sense sense for business customers. But we will make sure that customers know the reliability and ubiquity of what we do is unique and different than fixed wireless.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and, CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nJust Brian, just again, just as we.\nTalked about in the residential market, the long-term opportunity where we're only just getting started is that large enterprise and medium-sized business. And as you think about cybersecurity, and other data reliability, and just consumption behavior of businesses, and think of your own businesses and where that might lead to, and the use of, you know, new tools and video and everything else, you want to have the best network. And once again we have a really exciting team and roadmap on that front. So again we're battling the reality in one segment with great opportunity in others, and long-term love our situation.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks John. Thank you operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\nMaybe first just on broadband trends, I think you've been pursuing a line extension strategy for at least 18 months and that'll continue. So is it correct to assume that your gross adds on broadband are starting to pick up just as you add more passings in the market? And if that's true, can you give us any color on, within the deactivations, where they're headed? I think you've always said that you view fiber as the bigger competitive threat and so does that kind of help us understand what's going on between gross adds and net adds? And then separately on Peacock you talked about retaining subs between some of your big marquee sporting events and you've got a lot of great film on Peacock as well.\nI'm wondering what your tolerance is for original content and original content spend and how we think about originals on Peacock, maybe vis-à-vis a long-term breakeven goal. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nStephen.\nThis is Dave. Let me start with footprint and then go to competition views. So let me in terms of overall footprint expansion, you know the vast majority of our new passings each quarter are fill-ins within our existing footprint. The balance of the growth is mostly, you know, from our organic edge-outs into adjacent areas. And so with you know, some government subsidized builds representing a much smaller, albeit increasing portion.\nSo it's really the kind of three different components of it that we're looking at. And so you know it's still early and but you know we are very disciplined. We evaluate the risk, you know, adjusted returns of each, you know one of these network builds on a case-by-case basis and generally though the edge-outs as that will increase, they're adjacent sometimes located in between geographic markets that we currently serve.\nSo you know, looking ahead, we expect these edge-out projects to continue to contribute to the future growth in our total passings. We don't give to your question those specific numbers on this. I can tell you that we're going to reach very healthy penetration levels in a few years on these edge-out projects. So the ramp-ups happen pretty quickly, and we're pleased with the returns, though. So pretty disciplined process. We looked on the returns, and then as you shift towards the competition.\nThe environment, let me back up, and just overall, it's a very intense competitive environment that is very consistent the last several years, and so it picked up a bit. And when you have again three.\nFixed wireless competitors coming in pretty much at the same time, and you have.\nThe fiber level, about half of our footprint now has fiber competition of some form, and it's an intense competitive environment. But you know we have adjusted. We've been going up against fiber competition now for over 15 years, and it is, we've made adjustments, we've done I think very well in going toe to toe for the exactly as Brian laid it out, that our long term game plan is to focus on a better network, ubiquitous network, better products, surround it with the full portfolio of better products, and not chase units just for the sake of it.\nAnd we've had moments going up against fiber where they've gone way down market, they've become rational. We've had different cycles, and so I think we've made adjustments, and we have proven that we more than hold our own in that footprint.\nWhat we're seeing now is kind of an intense, more intense competitive focus around the lower end of the market. That's why we're segmenting, that's why we're doing what we're doing. Never losing sight though that we're going to have a better product than anybody in the marketplace, the better network, and backing it up with better devices that can eventually as we get to multi-gig symmetrical. And that's the key. Every single application ubiquitously delivered, that's our focus. So it's you know, it's a tough competitive environment. But I think we have a unique.\nDifferentiated approach.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nOn Peacock, I mean, we're very pleased, as we both, Jason and I said earlier, you know, with the quarter where we ended at 33.5 million subs 3 and a half years in. We are at a place now where we really are seeing traction in our approach to providing a service for consumers that is a combination of both entertainment and sports, and how those two go together. Very much a reflection, as we said from the beginning, of a mirror image of what we see as our strengths at NBCUniversal itself. So when you look at this quarter in particular, you end up with.\nIt started with a wild card game that brought in a tremendous number of subs ahead of where we expected it to be, and then retention that was ahead of where we expected it to be. And so that's obviously great, and the power of sports to bring audiences together, and we'll stay committed because of our strength in sports. But when you really reflect on what then happened in the weeks that followed, our viewing was at record highs across all parts of our non-sports portfolio. And in fact, in the quarter, we launched our biggest original Ted to the greatest success of any of the originals we've ever launched, and The Traitors 2, our reality series on Peacock. Both of those were in the Nielsen top 10 streaming in the earlier part of the year.\nSo I think we see the two, the parts of the portfolio interplaying well with each other. And obviously the strength of our movie studio, which we talked about earlier with Oppenheimer and The Holdovers. And now coming up in future quarters, Kung Fu Panda 4, that is another great source of strength into our portfolio. So I think you can expect to see us having a very broad approach to its sports, its originals, its next day airing of NBC content. It's our library and it's our Pay one movies. All those things going into a service that we think is one of the best values in streaming and a very distinct place over time in the streaming marketplace for consumers. And when you look ahead from where we started the year we are now in, continue to focus hard on retaining the growth and subs we had.\nQ2 will be a little lighter in terms of the cadence of our content. But when you look to the middle of the year, we've got Olympics. Right after that we've got the return of NFL, Big Ten, and our exclusive NFL game in Sao Paulo, Brazil, along with the tremendous movie slate, Fall Guy, Twisters, Despicable four, in addition to Kung Fu Panda four. And so we feel great about what we're doing and the progress we're making. And it's very consistent with the way we've described Peacock as taking advantage of what makes us great at NBCUniversal to begin with and taking our existing strengths and assets into a digital future. So that's. And it's one of our six big growth drivers. So glad to get a chance to comment on it. Thank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nThanks. One for Dave and one for Jason. Dave, taking a step back from sort of the increased competitive intensity you're seeing in the broadband market, I would love your perspectives on how the overall market is trending. As we tally up all the ads in the quarter, it looks like we're sort of trending to somewhere around half of what we normally see for the industry in the first quarter. Everybody's ads are down.\nAnd I'm wondering if you've got any thoughts as to what might be driving that. And then, Jason, on the segmentation strategy, you hit the low end of the market with some offers last year and then pulled back because you were worried about cannibalization. I'm wondering how the NOW you sort of structured NOW differently so you don't end up seeing that cannibalization impact. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nHey, Jonathan.\nDave, let me start with the broadband in its entirety, the whole market and a viewpoint. Let me begin with the broadband market as a whole is still growing, maybe at a slower pace than it was last year and the year before, but there's still going to be a pretty healthy amount of net adds in 2024 and likely beyond. The right way, though. In addition to that, I think you got everything we've talked about before. The right way we think to look about it is it's, you know, holding our own growing relationships responsibly, but it's also where the market is going and how broadband is being used. And that, as we talked about, the utility of the broadband product itself is only going up.\nSo when you look at the health of the entire category, it's the relationships, but it's also the overall usage and consumption. And for us, you've seen usage is up double digits, broadband only subs using over 700 GB of data a month. Over 70% of our subscriber base is on speed tiers of 50 megs or more, and nearly 1/3 of our customers are on a gig. Those are great trends for us over the long term and gives us the great confidence as we're investing and continuing to invest in a better network and a better customer experience, as Brian has said. So when you look at things, I think it's clearly competitive, as we've talked about. One other factor that enters into it in some cases, in certain segments, there's some people that revert back to mobile only that can happen.\nSo there's a variety of factors that could enter into it. But overall, as a category and a growth opportunity, quite optimistic about broadband.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nJonathan, let me start on segmentation, and Dave probably wants to chime in as well. So, on NOW, I think what's interesting and exciting about it is it's a dedicated sort of flanker brand strategy. We've had prepaid offers in the past sort of wedged into our existing portfolio. This is a more dedicated and branded strategy around it. That, by the way, the branding around this has worked very well in our UK market. For Sky, it's actually where the brand name came from, and, you know, so we expect this to have some resonance. I would point out the. If you look at where it's sort of targeted, we've got a 100 meg offer for $30. It's inclusive of taxes, fees, and equipment. We've got a $45 offering that's 200 megs and inclusive as well. Very competitive versus fixed wireless. Right.\nThat is in this range, maybe slightly higher, without the same reliability and ubiquity that we have.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Cable\n\nYeah, adding on to that, Jonathan, but you know, again, we've been doing prepaid broadband for a while, years, and.\nWe needed to refresh it, needed to update it, and put it in a more competitive position. The prepaid mobile is new and NOW TV is relatively new, but it's a segmented approach and if you think about it's all in pricing. It's very simple, it's really easy. There's no contracts, no credit checks, customers can sign up, pause, cancel online, anytime. It's a very straightforward but, you know, future light product as we keep our focus on the high end in terms of fully featured things, we'll continue to do that, but this just gives us a brand, gives us a product suite to be able to clearly and define segmentation in a way that we can manage through.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jonathan. We want to thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes the question and answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We're less than a month into the new year, and 2024 is already off to a great start. Two weeks ago, our entire company came together to make history, shattering records with the first exclusively streamed NFL wild card game on Peacock. Nearly 23 million viewers watched the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Miami Dolphins, consuming 30% of all internet traffic in the US and setting a new record in total US internet traffic for any night. Our investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth consumption.\nAlso, Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer picked up five Golden Globe awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Original Score. So with 2024 off to a terrific start, let's look back at 2023 where we produced consistently strong financial results and continued to execute against our long-term strategy. We've positioned our company to benefit from a significant number of scaled and diversified growth opportunities that are margin-accretive, namely residential broadband, mobile business services, theme parks, studios, and Peacock. In aggregate, our revenue in these businesses grew 8% in 2023 and comprised 55% of our total revenue for the year.\nOur healthy cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have enabled the organic investment that fuels these businesses and at the same time fund substantial capital return, including significant share repurchases. All of this has translated into excellent financial performance. For the third consecutive year, we generated the highest revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS in our company's history. Now let's go deeper on some of the important achievements during the year. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in our connectivity businesses. We maintained a strong trajectory in Xfinity Mobile, increasing our subscriber lines by 24% and total domestic wireless revenue by nearly 20%. We also performed well in our business services segment, which grew full year revenue and EBITDA by nearly 5%, with margins approaching 60%.\nWe exceeded our goal of adding over one million new homes and businesses passed and expect to do at or above this level in 2024.\nOur domestic broadband business remains strong. We kept our very large and healthy base of subscribers flat while growing residential ARPU 3.9%, the high end of our historical range, driving solid EBITDA growth and connectivity and platforms, and expanding margins to around 40% on an underlying basis. We achieved all of this despite an intensely competitive environment, and as I look back on 2023, I am confident that our strategy combined with excellent execution sets us up extremely well to navigate the road ahead. While the competitive environment is likely to remain at these levels for a period of time, broadband is still a very large, healthy, and profitable market, and the consumption trends that we're seeing are encouraging for the future. Customers are connecting more devices in their homes and using them for applications that require more capacity, faster speeds, and lower latency.\nOur fiber-deep and capital-efficient network is more than ready to meet this demand with 100,000mi of fiber and a clear path to offering multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our entire footprint with DOCSIS 4.0. I'd like to spend a minute briefly addressing the government's Affordable Connectivity Program. First, it's important to note that we built on our decade-long history in digital equity to effectively participate in ACP and have successfully leveraged the National Verifier Program in the process. While we hope that the White House and Congress renew this funding and keep these important resources available to the many people and households who have relied upon this program to stay digitally connected, we have already begun to communicate with ACP participants and will provide a range of options including our highly successful Internet Essentials program in the event that funding is discontinued.\nShifting to content and experiences, we've positioned ourselves to drive long-term profitable growth over the span of decades. We've built a remarkable portfolio of iconic content and strong franchises, both film and television, including live sports, news, and entertainment. Our market-leading businesses have tremendous reach and continue to perform and execute collaboratively, playing to our strengths by leveraging our IP and our incredible partners. Let's start with our studio group where we hit a major milestone ranking as the number one studio in film by worldwide box office with hits such as Super Mario Brothers, Oppenheimer, Fast X, and Five Nights at Freddy's. We are proud to work alongside our creative partners like Christopher Nolan, Chris Meledandri, and Jason Blum, who are innovative industry leaders to develop content that continues to delight audiences.\nAnd I'm really excited about another fantastic film slate in 2024 with the latest installment of Kung Fu Panda in March along with Despicable Me, and Twisters in July and Wicked slated for November, which will also benefit Peacock as these films and many others enter the Pay-One window. At the same time, our media segment continues to deliver, reaching over 100 million households every quarter with leading sports, news, and entertainment. We have the number one most watched news organization in the US and Sunday Night Football is pacing to be the most watched primetime show for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Peacock continued to be the fastest growing streamer in the US as a result of our holistic business model which leverages all of our brands to serve a broad range of viewers by providing them with options to match their evolving habits.\nIn the short period of time since we launched in 2020, we've seen strong momentum, ending the year at 31 million paid subscribers at $10 ARPU, supported by healthy trends in both engagement and churn. I'm excited for 2024. We started with a successful Wild Card game, which will soon be followed by Oppenheimer coming exclusively to Peacock and a full slate of both new and returning originals such as Ted, Peacock's most watched original title, additional Pay-One movies, and the Summer Olympics later this year. These next Olympic Games promise to be nothing short of spectacular, with the return of fans this time to Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\nWith the NBC broadcast network airing more content than ever before and Peacock as the streaming home for all Games, NBCUniversal would be the most comprehensive Olympic destination in US media history, with Xfinity once again playing a huge role in delivering each game on our Entertainment OS platform, which is now also available to Charter customers through XUMO at parks. We achieved record high revenue and EBITDA in 2023 and have exciting new attractions and experiences in the years ahead. We'll open Donkey Kong, another Nintendo themed land, next year in Osaka, which will expand Super Nintendo World by another 70%. We expect continuation of the strong trends in Hollywood, also driven by Super Nintendo World, and we'll see the completion of Epic Universe, our fourth gate in Orlando prior to its grand opening in 2025.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with all that we have achieved in 2023. We have incredible teams in each of our businesses and have executed against our plan exceptionally well, delivering very strong EBITDA, EPS, and Free Cash Flow. Going forward, our highest priority is to continue our strong operational performance enabled by the investments we are making in our six key growth areas, fueling their growth and further improving the profile of our business mix. The strength and stability of our company, including our balance sheet, enables us to make these investments while also providing our shareholders with substantial capital returns.\nSince we started buying back stock in late May of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our total shares outstanding, and with today's announcement, we've now increased our annualized dividend by 150% since I joined the company in 2015. Putting it all together, our strategy is working, and we see many years ahead that this formula will continue to deliver for our company and shareholders. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nEVP and CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Mike and good morning everyone. I'll begin on Slides four and with our consolidated results. Total revenue increased 2% to $31.3 billion for the Q4 and was consistent at $121.6 billion for the full year. On a reported basis, EBITDA was consistent at $8 billion for the Q4 and up 3% to $37.6 billion for the full year. Our EBITDA results include severance and other in this quarter as well as in last year's Q4, excluding these items totaling $527 million this quarter and $638 million in last year's quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 1% in the Q4 and remained at 3% growth for the full year. Adjusted EPS was up 2% to $0.84 a share for the Q4 and increased 9% to $3.98 for the full year.\nWe generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow for the quarter and $13 billion for the full year, which translates into $3.13 in free cash flow per share, which was up 10% year-over-year. We returned over 100% of this to shareholders with $4.7 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $15.8 billion for the full year. Our strong level of free cash flow includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our business in six broad and diversified growth categories, including residential, broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity, along with theme parks, streaming, and premium content at our studios. Taken together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue and grew at a high single-digit rate during the quarter and for the full year.\nNow let's turn to our business results starting on Slide six with connectivity and platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British Pound, which was up nearly 6% year-over-year, as usual. In order to highlight the underlying performance of the connectivity and platforms business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Unpacking that revenue in our core connectivity business, domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity increased 7% to $11 billion, while video advertising and other revenue declined 8% to $9 billion. Our strategy is to invest to drive growth in our core connectivity businesses while at the same time carefully managing businesses that are important but face secular headwinds.\nOn balance, this is a favorable mix shift for the profitability of our overall connectivity and platform segment. As reflected in our results, EBITDA for total connectivity and platforms increased 3% with EBITDA margins improving 130 basis points year-over-year. This includes severance and other of $422 million in the quarter and $456 million of charges in last year's Q4. Excluding these items in both periods, EBITDA increased 2% to $8 billion and EBITDA margins improved by 110 basis points. Margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 70 basis points to 46.2%. In terms of how our underlying performance in connectivity and platforms breaks out between residential and business on the same basis, excluding severance and other from both periods, residential EBITDA grew 2% with margins improving 120 basis points and business services EBITDA increased 5% with margins nearly unchanged at an impressive 57%.\nNow let's get further into the details, starting with our connectivity growth drivers. Residential connectivity revenue grew 7% driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 15% growth in domestic wireless, and 19% growth in international connectivity, while business services connectivity revenue grew 6%. Domestic broadband was once again driven by very strong ARPU growth of 3.9% for the quarter and for the year, landing at the high end of our historical 3 to 4% range. While our base of 32 million broadband subscribers remained stable over the past year, including the 34,000 subscriber loss this quarter, we remain focused on competing aggressively but in a financially balanced way as evidenced by this quarter and past year's results.\nWith the broadband marketplace remaining extremely competitive, we will continue to manage this balance, and expect ARPU growth will remain strong within our historical range and continue to be the driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2024. While we do not expect subscriber trends to improve in the coming quarters, we do expect them to improve over time. At the macro level, customers are consuming more, connecting more devices in their homes, and are using them for applications that collectively require even faster speeds, lower latency, and higher reliability over time. These secular trends are all moving in our favor, and we believe our marginal cost to add capacity to our network is unrivaled.\nThis is why we are investing in our fiber-deep network to further increase capacity and offer multi-gig symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our footprint and ensure that we stay way ahead of consumer demand with the best broadband offering and experience. We have deployed mid-splits to about 35% of our footprint and expect that to reach around 50% by the end of 2024. On the back of this, we launched our first DOCSIS 4.0 market during Q4 and we'll continue to launch additional markets this year. We are focused on what we can control. That means segmenting our customer base by offering our customers the right price, including value options at different speed tiers, and driving ARPU ahead in an environment where broadband subscriber growth remains challenged.\nWe're doing this in the context of aggressive network upgrades and expansion, putting us in a great position to eventually return to subscriber growth. Speaking of network expansion, we exceeded our goal of passing 1 million new homes and businesses in 2023, landing at nearly 1.1 million, and we plan to replicate this in 2024 with this level or potentially even greater footprint expansion.\nSwitching to wireless, we hit a great milestone, eclipsing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time this quarter, with the year-over-year increase due to higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up 1.3 million or 24% year-over-year to 6.5 million in total. This includes 310,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We've had a healthy run rate, generating around 300,000 net additional lines per quarter for the last two years, and we're consistently in the market testing new offers and will continue to do that throughout the coming year with the goal that some of these offers will translate into accelerated line additions as the year progresses.\nWith only 11% penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer accounts, we still have a big opportunity and a long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue increased 19%, driven by steady mid-teens growth in broadband along with strong growth in wireless, which had healthy growth in both device sales and service revenue. Finally, business services connectivity revenue increased 6%, driven by consistent growth in our small business category as we grew ARPU through rate and higher penetration of additional products like Security Edge, and from strong growth in mid-market and enterprise.\nThe revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video advertising, and other revenue. The video revenue decline was driven by continued customer losses. The lower other revenue reflects similar dynamics in wireline voice, and advertising was impacted by a tough comparison to last year, which benefited from higher political revenue in our domestic markets. As I mentioned earlier, excluding severance and other, connectivity and platform's total EBITDA increased 2%, with adjusted margin up 110 basis points. To unpack this improvement, the main driver is the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses, a transition you've seen for the last few years and that we expect to continue. In addition to the mix shift, we are benefiting from ongoing cost discipline. For every quarter this year, including the Q4, five out of six categories of expenses we report have decreased.\nThe only category that grew is direct product costs which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. In addition, we continue to get more efficient with better tools and technology. Compared to 2017, we reduced our domestic truck rolls by nearly 50% and customer interactions are down nearly 40% even while we increased our domestic relationships by nearly 5 million over the same time period. The investment we are making in our network, including virtualization and using technology to enhance the customer experience, not only makes us more competitive, it makes us more cost-efficient. Together, the mix shift, the cost discipline, and the technology advances we've made in customer service are all structural and we expect them to continue positioning us to drive higher profitability and further margin expansion in 2024 and for the foreseeable future.\nNow let's turn to content and experiences. On Slide seven, revenue increased 6% to $11.5 billion and EBITDA increased 2% to $932 million, excluding severance of $101 million this quarter and $186 million in last year's Q4. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% reflecting a decrease in media, partially offset by strong growth at studios and record results at parks. Now let's take a closer look at content and experiences starting with media. Media revenue increased 3% driven by strong growth at Peacock, which was up 57% and, similar to wireless, crossed the $1 billion in quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Domestic distribution increased 9%, driven by Peacock subscription revenue growth of 88%, fueled by the continuation of solid growth in our paid subscriber base.\nWe ended the quarter with 31 million Peacock paid subscribers, up 10 million over the past year, including 3 million net additions in the quarter driven by sports, including the NFL and the Big Ten, and movies, notably the day-and-date movie, Five Nights at Freddy's, and a variety of originals and other entertainment programming. International networks revenue, which is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports, increased 17% primarily due to the increase in sports content this year as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Finally, domestic advertising declined 7% due to a tough comparison to last year, which included a significant incremental contribution in advertising from Telemundo's broadcast of the FIFA World Cup.\nExcluding the World Cup, advertising increased nearly 3% driven by strong Peacock advertising and from our strong sports lineup. Peacock advertising increased 50% again excluding the World Cup and hit an all-time high. Media EBITDA decreased 50% mainly due to higher sports costs, reflecting a full quarter of the contractual rate increase in our NFL programming, the addition of Big Ten to our sports programming lineup this year, and higher Premier League costs compared to last year when games were paused for four weeks to accommodate the timing of the World Cup at Peacock. EBITDA losses continue to moderate in the Q4 with nice year-over-year improvement resulting in full year losses for Peacock of $2.7 billion, which was slightly better than the expectation we had previously communicated.\n2023 marked the peak in annual losses at Peacock, and for 2024 we expect to show meaningful improvement in losses versus 2023. Turning to studios, revenue increased 4% driven by theatrical revenue growth of 59% due to our performance at the box office this quarter with Five Nights at Freddy's, Trolls Band Together, The Exorcist, and Migration. In fact, Five Nights at Freddy's was the highest grossing horror film of 2023 and also set a record on Peacock as the most watched title of all time in the first five days of its release. In addition to the films this quarter, we benefited from prior period titles moving through profitable licensing windows, driving EBITDA growth of 83% to $308 million. At theme parks, revenue increased 12% and EBITDA also increased 12% to $872 million for the quarter.\nThese strong results were again driven by growth at our international parks, especially as Osaka continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World driving higher attendance and per cap spending relative to both last year and pre-pandemic levels in Hollywood. We also continued to benefit from the positive consumer reaction to Super Nintendo World, which opened earlier in 2023, driving strong attendance and growth in per caps and resulting in Hollywood's best Q4 EBITDA in its history. In Orlando, our results were also strong, with attendance in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels and revenue substantially ahead. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide eight.\nAs I mentioned previously, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter and $13 billion for the year, and we achieved this while absorbing meaningful capital investments to expand our footprint, further strengthen our domestic broadband network, scale our streaming business, and support the continued build of our Epic Universe park ahead of its 2025 opening. As a result, total capital spending increased 13% for the year, driven by higher CapEx at connectivity and platforms. CapEx increased 1.5% for the full year with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.1%, primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network in 2024. We expect CapEx intensity to be in the same range as we continue to transition our US network to DOCSIS 4.0 and accelerate our growth in homes passed.\nI'll just note that while our CapEx intensity at connectivity and platforms has been at around 10% for the past few years, this is not a specific internal target for us; rather, it's an output our teams are going as fast as possible. However, if, for example, we have an opportunity to accelerate further our growth in homes passed at accretive economics, then we'd welcome that opportunity. But right now the envelope has been right around 10%, and we're very happy with the pace that we were on and the progress we're making. Content & Experiences' CapEx increased by $1.2 billion for the full year, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of the increase in spend in 2024. We expect Parks CapEx to remain elevated and then decrease in 2025 when we open Epic.\nWorking capital was $2 billion for the year, which was better than we expected, improving $1 billion over last year's level. Our 2023 result included benefits from the pause in production during the work stoppages associated with the writers and actors strikes during the year. Turning to return of capital on our balance sheet for the full year, we returned a total of $15.8 billion to shareholders. This includes share repurchases of $11 billion, including $3.5 billion in Q4. In addition, dividend payments totaled $4.8 billion. As we announced this morning, we are raising our dividend by $0.08 per share to $1.24 per share. That's our 16th consecutive annual increase.\nWe ended the year with net leverage of 2.3 times in line with our target leverage of around 2.4 times, and we expect to remain at this target level in 2024.\nWrapping up, we had a very solid quarter and a great year, and we're focused on continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy supported by our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. I'm proud of the steady and consistent framework which guides our decision-making. We're going to invest aggressively for organic growth across our six key areas. We'll protect our balance sheet and cash flow position, and return capital to shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for a few remarks before we turn to Q and A.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to just emphasize a couple of points as I think about the year. It's hard not to be really proud of what we've accomplished. 2023 was the best financial year in our 60-year history, and we already have nice momentum in 2024. As Mike and Jason just outlined, we have a unique company that is incredibly well positioned. We always try to think about and invest for the long term, particularly across the six key growth drivers. What's also important is that in 2023 alone, we returned $16 billion in capital to our shareholders.\nAs you just heard, it's the 16th.\nStraight year that we just raised our dividend. That's consistency. So when you put this all together, we have a great team. That's always most important to me, and we're making the right adjustments to our businesses to position us to win, grow, and continue to return capital to shareholders. While there may be speculation of what we could do next, I'd like you to hear it directly from me. I love the company we have, so the bar continues to be even higher for us to do anything other than the plan you heard today. I want to thank all our employees for a great 2023 as they continue to execute at the highest level. With that, let me hand it over to Marci to take all your questions.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, let's open the call for Q and A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press Star, then the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press Star and the number two. If you are using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up your handset first before pressing the numbers once again. If there are any questions, press Star, then the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning, Brian, and thanks for those clear comments. I wanted to ask you guys about broadband and separately about Peacock. Jason, you talked about, and Mike talked about the consumer trends that you think play to your strengths. But you guys are doing a lot at the network level, including in 2024. You talked about your converged offers that you're testing and getting more aggressive. I know you're not going to put a timeline on it, but can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to reaccelerate broadband customer trends? Because the product you are bringing to the marketplace is seemingly getting better even this year.\nI realize you're talking long term, but I just wanted to hear more from you on the things you're doing in the business product today and how that may or may not translate into better trends on the customer front over the course of the next 12, 24 months. On Peacock, maybe for Mike, how much more investment does this business need? I think you guys had talked a while ago about getting a $5 billion of programming investment. If you look at Q4 anyway, you're basically there now, got good revenue momentum. I'm trying to think about the path to getting this business to break even. I'd love to hear what you think the business needs in terms of incremental investment from here. Thanks a lot.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nBen, this is Dave. Let me start with broadband and then hand it over to Mike and Jason. But on broadband, as Mike and Jason said, the environment pretty much remains the same. There's still macro activity, moves are down, but to your point, it is intensely competitive, especially the difference that has been there in this particular competitive cycle. It's especially in the lower income segment. So the result of it is the main driver customer activity continues to be lower connects as churn remains near record lows. And despite this, we're striking, I think, the right balance between customer growth in ARPU. We kept our sub base relatively flat, grew ARPU 3.9% for the quarter and the year. And so we're also growing, you know, C&P EBITDA and expanding margins.\nSo, competitive cycles like this one, you know, we've been through many, and this, what makes you know what happens during some of these cycles, there's new footprint, the competitive footprint, some unique discounting occurs. I think fiber is a pretty good example of one that we went through years ago and continue to have. There's pressure on net adds as you go through the initial phase of the cycle, but we evolved our approach, and we have and continue to compete very well against fiber.\nSo I think this cycle is headlined by fixed wireless, and really the emphasis on more of the lower-income segment. They added new footprint. There's some offer pressure, but you know we have continued to adapt the keys. You know, for us through this cycle is continue to build better products and from the network to the Wi-Fi experience, and the network investments that we're making are very consistent, and we've laid it out mid-split. We're pleased with our progress. We're finishing 2023, 33% upgraded, will be around 50% by year-end 2024, and we started to deploy 4.0 and our path towards symmetrical service offerings. So this is all due to where we believe strongly the market is going, and the market is going to have more devices that will be used and be hung on the network, and there will be more usage and engagement.\nSo, with that, for the long run, we want to be in position to compete as things shift. We're going to compete in a segmented way for every segment, and we'll be aggressive in each one. But we don't expect subscriber trends to improve over the coming quarters, but we do expect to grow over time. So we will compete aggressively and be in position when the macro environment shifts. And as we see with fixed wireless that there's an opportunity and will be an opportunity to get more win-backs, we want to be in position for that as well. So, and throughout it all, we're going to protect a healthy base of 32 million broadband customers, managing rate and volume throughout.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nIt's Mike. Ben. So thanks for the question on Peacock. I'll expand a little bit on the question, but get to it in terms of where we see programming going in the end. So you gotta say we couldn't be prouder of what we accomplished with Peacock in 2023. So to end the year with paying subs at 31 million, up 50% year-over-year and that's only three years in, we're achieving a level of scale with paying subs that's about 60% of the level of, you know, the streamers that have been out there for many years domestically ex Netflix and we're holding a very strong ARPU at $10 per sub.\nSo while it's not the scale we ultimately plan to get to, I gotta say the team has done a fantastic job when, you know, lots of question, could we even get this far? So from here it's really a matter of continuing to execute against the strategy that's gotten us here. And that is expected, as we said earlier, to drive improvement in Peacock's bottom line from the peak losses that we saw in 2023. And if you really think about what that strategy is, it's to manage Peacock and our linear TV businesses as one. The strategy really is to leverage the great relevant content properties we have both at NBC, which is news, sports, and entertainment, obviously Bravo, and some of the other assets we have in the cable business, and Universal with the Pay-One window.\nSo when you put it all together, continuing to execute against that, we're going to look to get more scale, and the things we're doing are both to drive more scale, more subs, but also get more engagement with the subs we have and drive improvements in churn, which we've been pretty pleased with. So ultimately your question, where are we relative to leveling off a little bit of the growth rate of programming spend as we get to this level, is clearly part of the improvement in Peacock losses standalone that will be a factor as we see, you know, continued strong growth on the revenue side given the higher level of subs and the expectation for continuing to add.\nBut again, I would just say I'm less focused on what standalone Peacock losses are doing than I am on doing what's right for the long term, for the totality of the media business, which is linear and streaming. I think we've navigated a very good path for us. So really pleased with what we've done.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett. From MoffettNathanson, your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. I wonder if you could do an early post mortem on the Chiefs Dolphins playoff game, what subscription growth it drove at Peacock, and what early churn impact you've had on that. I know there was some chatter that you guys tried to play down about whether that amount of traffic load on the Internet would have some impact on fixed wireless. But I'm wondering if you just have any observations about how other platforms handled the volume that that game drove in terms of traffic.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nCraig, it's Mike. I'll start and Dave can chime in if he likes. But as we said earlier, we couldn't be more pleased with the way we performed in the Wild Card Game. It was the biggest live stream event in US history, which is no small feat to have performed so seamlessly, which really highlights what we've done in Dave's business on the broadband side and the technology platforms that we've built and have talked about repeatedly that are supporting Peacock, Sky, and our Xfinity products and now XUMO. So I think we've built tremendous advantage and are always looking for ways to we're very happy to see the impact on, you know, our broadband usage, regardless of what it means for other ways of getting the platform across. We couldn't be happier that it's that it worked well and performed really well with that many concurrent streams.\nBut what in terms of adding subs we would expect to see, we're not going to comment on it today, but we would expect to see increase in paid subs. We're focused now on, you know, retention of the subs that came in right around the game. What's important is it's both the subs that came in during the game and the engagement of the people that were already on the platform. So engagement and retention is really going to be focused on what's coming next. And we teased a lot of that, including Oppenheimer coming to the platform on 16 February. We have the Summer Olympics coming now that we're post strikes. You'll see a number of Peacock originals and additional movies from the Pay-One Window that we've got with Universal. But really when I think about it, it's at the scale we've gotten to.\nWhat's important is to keep people engaged with the platform and all the content that's there, not the Wild Card game in and of itself. So the job, all we want is to get more people in the door and get everybody that's already in the door re-engage with the platform around that game and then try to continue to drive engagement afterwards. Happy to report that we've seen record levels of hours viewed in the days that have followed the Wild Card game itself, including launching Ted, our new comedy series that's been the most watched original series for Peacock in its first seven days yet on the platform, which speaks to the benefit of getting that much engagement at the moment we're launching that.\nAnd likewise, the second season of the reality show Traitors premiered right afterwards, and it's also the biggest original reality season launch for us through its first four days on the platform. So I think that's the way I look at the total picture there, Brian. I think you want to chime in.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nI just want to say that we. Thank the NFL for having the confidence in picking our total company to. Carry this out. The entire industry cooperated and participated, and it was a very proud moment for, I think, U.S. internet in history. It worked flawlessly, and I think is just another proof point of all the investments that have been made. You know, thank you again. We'll see how the results all turn out. We really, really pleased.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you. As a two-parter, as Brian just said, you have a unique mix of assets. So can you talk a little bit about your longer-term video strategy from all sides of the company, from both cable and NBCU? Meaning, do you have any plans to take Peacock global? Your recent Paramount affiliate renewal deal seems like status quo. And then a separate question, you just touched a little bit on Epic. It's only one year away. Can you give us some color on size, scope, and how differentiated the offering will be? Thank you.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nJessica, thanks. So on Peacock and in particular, let's take video in a couple of pieces. So on our streaming ambitions, clearly we viewed it and we've talked about it for, you know, a long time. We want our existing media assets to have a strong, you know, future in a world where consumer behavior is taking people more to streaming because that's the way they want to experience it. So our strength obviously in video distribution from the NBC side has been, you know, US focused. And I think we are focused on, you know, very focused on getting domestic, domestic scale. What we've done internationally and what we might do one day is a separate story. But for now we've been focused on making sure through partnerships, JVs, whether it's SkyShowtime, whether it's Peacock type content that makes its way onto Sky platforms.\nWe've got a venture partner in MultiChoice in Africa. So we're looking for ways and a rational approach economically to.\nScale up Peacock domestically while not giving up too much in terms of economics. A lot of people talk about us having global scale. We want to win here first and get to the place we need to go. That's really where we're most focused in terms of what's happening on the domestic side through video distribution. I think we continue to be a big player in the space with our own content from NBC, but also as I think the best partner given the scale of our reach in broadband for both traditional linear, but at the same time streaming partners. We've seen a lot of progress and a lot of collaboration with players and partners that want to reach the customer base we have with our broadband customer base.\nYou know, the natural point of engagement with them aggregating content and acquiring new content, if they don't have it, through XUMO, X1, and the platform that Dave and team have built, I think we're really well positioned to play a part in that as well.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nJessica, this is Dave. I just would add, you know, you think about the overall video approach is linear streaming on demand, still DVR. It's all of them that I think we are in a unique position to be able to tie together. Back to the Wild Card game, it's an example of great broadband being able to handle it. At the same time, what's really important in video is the experience matters. The experience get connected to the overall network. Performance is so critical. Finding what you want easily and simply being able to engage. So the platforms that we've built over time, starting with X1, now XUMO, very important to us in the long run.\nOne thing I would add is Brian. On Epic, just to touch on that part of the question. It's completely original. It's maybe the most exciting project I've seen since we bought NBCUniversal, getting built. I think it's the first new entire theme park in decades in the US. We're so excited. We're taking the board of directors to see the construction the next couple of weeks, which is something we haven't ever done before. So I think you all want to be there.\nSometime. I think 2023 and 2024 are the peak CapEx years for the construction. We expect to open in 2025. I give Mark Woodbury and the entire team at Universal incredible kudos to coordinate something of the scale and magnitude that's being built.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. Two questions, if I could. First, on the ACP commentary, I think you guys had to contact ACP subscribers this week. I mean, any way you could quantify the size of the base or maybe the financial impact? And should we see anything this quarter? Is it really something, if it doesn't get renewed, that we really expect for, say, Q2? And then over on the media side, it looks like you guys saw some real ad strength. So just any commentary on what you're seeing in the ad market? It looks like if you look at core advertising, it was actually up this year, and I'm wondering if that's just strength in NFL and maybe Big Ten or just what some of the underlying factors are there.\nGreat, thanks.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nJohn, this is Dave. Let me start with ACP. To specifically answer your question. We have 1.4 million customers that have benefited from this program, which we obtained through the National Verifier program. So, we feel good about the credentials of these customers. Most of these customers in this customer base were already our customers prior to the ACP program.\nbeen very consistent on this. We want the program to continue, but I think we're very well positioned to support these customers if it does not. We have a good business model in place and a history of knowing how to segment our customer base and have products and packages at a variety of price points to serve our customers well, including well over a decade that would include Internet Essentials. So with this, we'll evaluate this as it plays out. It may be a risk, but one we feel is very manageable for us given how we've worked with this program and how we manage our customer base in general.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nAnd John, it's Mike on the advertising side. I'd say that the, you know, the ad market, we have seen it remain stable and definitely pleased with our performance in Q4 when you exclude 2022 World Cup and normalize for that. We did, you know, we did grow ad revenue even with the difficult comp comparison to last year's political quarter. So we are seeing a few encouraging signs like stabilization across most categories. CPG and retail, too, that improved in particular. We're not seeing any pressure, any real pressure on cancellations from last year's upfronts, which is good, and scatter premiums are pretty healthy. Double-digit increases. What we're seeing, we've seen recently. But you know, I would, you know, say that it's too early to say that there's a sustainable rebound going on.\nToo much remains uncertain on the macro side, and we're heading into a period, for us at least, that has less sports programming in the early part of the year. So, you know, but regardless of the full year ahead, whether the environment, you know, macro wise gets better from here, it doesn't. We feel like we're well positioned with our must-see tentpoles, which include obviously the Olympics coming up, the elections, and then going back to the earlier points of now being much more scaled at Peacock. We're seeing nice progress on the capacity and inventory that we have there. So those are the dynamics I think we're seeing in advertising.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is now live.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks. Two for Jason. You mentioned that if you saw opportunities to expand your footprint with good economics, you'd do it in a heartbeat. Are you referring to the opportunity in beat? And is that something that you expect to potentially hit later this year, or is that more of a 2025 impact? And then on repurchases, we saw the reauthorization of $15 billion. You're going at a pace of $3.5 billion a quarter at the moment. Should we expect that to continue through 2024?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nEVP and CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jonathan.\nLet me take them in reverse order and then potentially tag team with Dave if he wants to, on the footprint side. So buybacks, you're right. We reauthorized a re up this morning for $15 billion. Never meant to be guidance when we do this, but, you know, nonetheless, healthy reauthorization. Saying that. I think that, you know, the formula that's been in place for very strong capital returns continues to be in place. I think we're comfortably within our leverage range, as I stated, which is right around 2.4 times. We continue to generate very strong free cash flow. And, you know, if you look at the recent history, since mid-2021, since we started buying back or restarted the buyback program, we've bought back 15% of our stock in that timeframe. So very good metric there. So more capital returns to continue.\nFeel very good about the trajectory into 2024. I think on the footprint side, we've been very clear that to the extent, you know, first and foremost, as we talk about capital intensity, in Dave's world, you know, right around 10%, it's been there for the last couple of years. The expectation is that it will be there again in 2024. But we've also been very clear that that's not necessarily a constraint on the business. To the extent we can move faster, you know, we'll do that and we'd like to. I think as you look at the past couple years on homes passed, we did 850,000 homes passed in 2022. We were able to accelerate that in 2023 up to 1.1 million. And we gave guidance this morning for 1.1 million or slightly higher next year. So we think we can further accelerate that.\nMost of that, in terms of the guide for 2024, is self-funded, but we have been making our way into the ARPA programs and had some success there. To the extent we're successful with BEAD, and I think we certainly expect to be, that would be more 2025 and beyond.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThis is. Dave, I would only add that when. You do these programs and we have.\nStarted and we are aggressively pursuing opportunities, as Jason said, at this stage mostly self-funded, but we are working with local governments on programs like ARPA and others. But we are going for opportunities where it makes sense. The great part, and a little bit what Brian mentioned right from the get-go, there's just been terrific execution as we've scaled operationally getting ready for this. So the 1.1 million that we did this past year, looking to do that or more into 2024, you know we are on it and this is a real opportunity for us. Having said that, you know the nature of these projects, it takes a while to build them up and then driving penetration. And I would look for, you know, more of a benefit in 2025.\nWe plan to participate where it is consistent with our business goals, but the process, quite frankly, is still in flux.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahall",
    "content2": "Managing Director and Senior Analyst of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. Maybe first I was wondering if you could expand on your Xfinity Mobile plans for 2024. One of your peers has been more promotional. I think that's something you've kept an eye on, and we saw you get a bit more promotional last year with the iPhone deal. You also talked about broadband ARPU being the biggest driver of broadband revenue, and I know that can suffer on a GAAP basis if you do lean into mobile. So I'd love to just hear more about how you're thinking about the broadband and mobile strategies coming together. And then Jason, just the severance that you took in the quarter, you know, the lion's share fell at connectivity and platforms. How should we think about the benefits to OpEx in 2024? You said five out of the six buckets decreased last year.\nSo maybe you can give us a bit of a view of what non-programming OpEx looks like for connectivity and platforms this year? Thank you.\n\nDave Watson\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSteven, this is Dave. Let me start with wireless, and so I think we've been consistent on this one too. Wireless is one of the key long-term growth drivers for us. It's been pointed out in the six that the team has talked about, and it is absolutely a great companion to broadband. It has good standalone economics and a great runway ahead for penetration of mobile to the broadband base. So, you know, it's performing well. Our domestic revenue was up over 15%. We have over six million lines, including the 310,000 that we added in the quarter, and we're only at 11% penetration, as Jason said, to the broadband base. So a lot of runway ahead, and it is absolutely a key part of all our go-to-market activity, whether it's acquisition, base management, upgrade activity to the base.\nAs you've noted, Stephen, we have been very focused on upgrade activity and retention. So our results have been consistent right around 300,000 new lines per quarter. Pretty healthy run rate for a considerable period of time. Having said that, I think we can improve on these results. We are consistently in the market trying new offers both in terms of broadband and mobile, and together, and we segment the opportunity, and so we do have unique opportunities that we evaluate, and we continue to be hopeful that some of these offers will accelerate our line additions over time and as the year progresses. So we have a great roadmap in terms of innovation and offers between Wi-Fi and mobile, and we want to leverage both and continue to build a better product and service. Our mobile service, our core service offering, delivers better value day in, day out.\nWe really like, though, our capital-light approach with the MVNO, and I think we're in a great position to win in convergence. So I think we have a leg up on the competition with this capital-light strategy that does have to involve customer and/or network trade-offs. So we'll continue to be opportunistic in evaluating progress, but I think there's upside.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nEVP and CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nStephen, let me just round that out quickly because part of the question was, you know, it seemed like are we governing wireless at all as it relates to broadband ARPU growth and gap realization of broadband ARPU growth. The two are not connected. We will do what's right for the business first and foremost to the extent we're finding ways to accelerate wireless and you know, I think have opportunity to do that and not be held back by what it means for broadband ARPU. Although we do see as, and just to reiterate, broadband ARPU growth in both the Q4 and for the full year, 3.9%, high end of our historical range of 3% to 4%, and we guided to the coming year to still be in that range of 3% to 4%. Consistent and strong ARPU growth.\nOn the severance question, as we step back, we're focused on investing capital and resources in our key growth areas. So we've identified six key growth areas where investments and OpEx are being directed while managing carefully businesses that are important to us but face secular headwinds. I think you saw that in the Q4 with severance actions. We took these actions to get ahead and position ourselves for continued transitions in these businesses in 2024 and beyond. I would point out, you mentioned connectivity and platforms specifically. That's where the bigger severance charges were. You're right. Five out of six categories of expense were down year-over-year in 2023. These type of actions and transitioning our business and managing the expense base are a big part of that.\nIf you look at margin expansion, which we've seen for a long period of time in the CMP business and gave an outlook that we expect to continue, that this is all part of that ticking action to get ahead of these transitions. I will point out what we also said in the prepared remarks. If you look back in the last six years, we've taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system. So truck rolls versus 2017 are down 50%. So cut in half and transactional volumes, if you will, or interactions are down 40%. So pretty significant expense opportunities relative to that that we see continuing as well.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Sebastiano Petti from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you for the question. Just wanted to see if you could provide additional color on perhaps the content and experiences segment CapEx expectations as we look beyond Epic. I think Jason, you did say in 2025 capital intensity in content and experiences should tick down as the Epic build finishes. As we think about your plans for regional parks in the US, you know, headlines about a UK park construction, you know, perhaps over the next several years as well. Any color on how we should be thinking about is there a parks CapEx holiday before a, you know, a re-acceleration, and then just a housekeeping question on Peacock, obviously very strong net adds inside of 2023.\nMicah, you did say that you do expect sub growth that to, but could you perhaps quantify what the benefit of the conversion from Comcast Bundle subs from Free2Pay was within the year, and as we're thinking about organic or, you know, underlying growth, you know, that will benefit from the NFL playoff game, Oppenheimer, and some of the other stuff you listed out. Thank you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nEVP and CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nSure. Sebastiano. On parks, Jason said we are, you know, going to remain at the elevated level around Epic with the two expansion parks, Halloween Horror Nights and the Universal Kids in Frisco, Texas, you know, underway at this stage. We'll remain elevated in 2024, and then as we come to completion of Epic in 2025, rolling into 2025, ease off from there. I think the easing off is, I wouldn't necessarily call it a holiday so much as, much like we talked about adding additional passings in cable, if we see these projects pencil out for good return, we'd be excited in the years that follow. Can't predict when to continue to give the parks and experiences business a, you know, whatever capital it requires.\nRight now with the visibility we have for what's, you know, in the pipeline, what Jason described as a trajectory is the right trajectory. On, you know, Peacock, I think we did a good job converting our Comcast free subs to paid subs. You know, they're now rolling into, after a few months at a lower price, rolling into the full price. I think we did a great job across the company on executing that.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Sebastiano. That concludes our call. We appreciate all of you joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes the question and answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast Q4 and full year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to Slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our investor relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We're less than a month into the new year, and 2024 is already off to a great start. Two weeks ago, our entire company came together to make history, shattering records with the first exclusively streamed NFL Wild Card game on Peacock. Nearly 23 million viewers watched the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Miami Dolphins, consuming 30% of all Internet traffic in the US and setting a new record in total US Internet traffic for any night. Our investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the Internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth consumption.\nAlso, Universal Pictures Oppenheimer picked up five Golden Globe awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Original Score. With 2024 off to a terrific start, let's look back at 2023, where we produced consistently strong financial results and continued to execute against our long-term strategy. We've positioned our company to benefit from a significant number of scaled and diversified growth opportunities that are margin accretive, namely residential broadband, mobile, business services, theme parks, studios, and Peacock. In aggregate, our revenue in these businesses grew 8% in 2023 and comprised 55% of our total revenue for the year.\nOur healthy cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have enabled the organic investment that fuels these businesses, and at the same time fund substantial capital return, including significant share repurchases. All of this has translated into excellent financial performance. For the third consecutive year, we generated the highest revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS in our company's history. Now let's go deeper on some of the important achievements during the year. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in our connectivity businesses. We maintained a strong trajectory in Xfinity Mobile, increasing our subscriber lines by 24% and total domestic wireless revenue by nearly 20%.\nWe also performed well in our business services segment, which grew full year revenue and EBITDA by nearly 5%, with margins approaching 60%, and we exceeded our goal of adding over 1 million new homes and businesses passed, and expect to do at or above this level in 2024.\nOur domestic broadband business remains strong. We kept our very large and healthy base of subscribers flat while growing residential ARPU 3.9%, the high end of our historical range, driving solid EBITDA growth in connectivity and platforms, and expanding margins to around 40% on an underlying basis. We achieved all of this despite an intensely competitive environment. As I look back on 2023, I am confident that our strategy, combined with excellent execution, sets us up extremely well to navigate the road ahead. While the competitive environment is likely to remain at these levels for a period of time, broadband is still a very large, healthy, and profitable market, and the consumption trends that we're seeing are encouraging for the future. Customers are connecting more devices in their homes and are using them for applications that require more capacity, faster speeds, and lower latency.\nOur fiber deep and capital efficient network is more than ready to meet this demand with 100,000mi of fiber and a clear path to offering multi gigabit symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our entire footprint. With DOCSIS 4.0, I'd like to spend a minute briefly addressing the government's Affordable Connectivity Program. First, it's important to note that we built on our decade long history in digital equity to effectively participate in ACP and have successfully leveraged the National Verifier Program in the process. While we hope that the White House and Congress renew this funding and keep these important resources available to the many people and households who have relied upon this program to stay digitally connected, we have already begun to communicate with ACP participants and will provide a range of options, including our highly successful Internet Essentials program, in the event that funding is discontinued.\nShifting to contents and experiences, we've positioned ourselves to drive long-term profitable growth over the span of decades. We've built a remarkable portfolio of iconic content and strong franchises in both film and television, including live sports, news, and entertainment. Our market-leading businesses have tremendous reach and continue to perform and execute collaboratively, playing to our strengths by leveraging our IP and our incredible partners. Let's start with our Studio group, where we hit a major milestone, ranking as the number one studio in film by worldwide box office with hits such as Super Mario Bros., Oppenheimer, Fast X, and Five Nights at Freddy's. We are proud to work alongside our creative partners like Christopher Nolan, Chris Meledandri, and Jason Blum, who are innovative industry leaders, to develop content that continues to delight audiences.\nI'm really excited about another fantastic film slate in 2024 with the latest installment of Kung Fu Panda in March, along with Despicable Me and Twisters in July, and Wicked slated for November, which will also benefit Peacock as these films and many others enter the Pay-One Window. At the same time, our media segment continues to deliver, reaching over 100 million households every quarter with leading sports, news, and entertainment. We have the number one most watched news organization in the US, and Sunday Night Football is pacing to be the most watched primetime show for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Peacock continued to be the fastest growing streamer in the US, a result of our holistic business model, which leverages all of our brands to serve a broad range of viewers by providing them with options to match their evolving habits.\nIn the short period of time since we launched in 2020, we've seen strong momentum, ending the year at 31 million paid subscribers at a $10 ARPU, supported by healthy trends in both engagement and churn. I'm excited for 2024. We started with the successful Wild Card game, which will soon be followed by Oppenheimer coming exclusively to Peacock, and a full slate of both new and returning originals, such as Ted, Peacock's most watched original title, additional Pay-One movies, and the Summer Olympics later this year. These next Olympic Games promise to be nothing short of spectacular, with the return of fans, this time to Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\nWith the NBC Broadcast Network airing more content than ever before, and Peacock as the streaming home for all Games, NBC Universal would be the most comprehensive Olympic destination in US media history, with Xfinity once again playing a huge role in delivering each game on our Entertainment OS platform, which is now also available to Charter customers through XUMO at parks. We achieved record high revenue and EBITDA in 2023, and have exciting new attractions and experiences in the years ahead. We'll open Donkey Kong, another Nintendo themed land, next year in Osaka, which will expand Super Nintendo World by another 70%. We expect continuation of the strong trends in Hollywood, also driven by Super Nintendo World, and we'll see the completion of Epic Universe, our fourth gate in Orlando, prior to its grand opening in 2025.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with all that we have achieved in 2023. We have incredible teams in each of our businesses and have executed against our plan exceptionally well, delivering very strong EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. Going forward, our highest priority is to continue our strong operational performance enabled by the investments we are making in our six key growth areas, fueling their growth, and further improving the profile of our business mix. The strength and stability of our company, including our balance sheet, enables us to make these investments while also providing our shareholders with substantial capital returns. Since we started buying back stock in late May of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our total shares outstanding, and with today's announcement, we've now increased our annualized dividend by 150% since I joined the company in 2015.\nPutting it all together, our strategy is working, and we see many years ahead that this formula will continue to deliver for our company and shareholders. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nEVP and CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slides four and five with our consolidated results. Total revenue increased 2% to $31.3 billion for the Q4 and was consistent at $121.6 billion for the full year. On a reported basis, EBITDA was consistent at $8 billion for the Q4 and up 3% to $37.6 billion for the full year. Our EBITDA results include severance and other in this quarter as well as in last year's Q4. Excluding these items totaling $527 million this quarter and $638 million in last year's quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased 1% in the Q4 and remained at 3% growth for the full year. Adjusted EPS was up 2% to $0.84 a share for the Q4 and increased 9% to $3.98 for the full year.\nWe generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow for the quarter and $13 billion for the full year, which translates into $3.13 in free cash flow per share, which was up 10% year-over-year, and we returned over 100% of this to shareholders with $4.7 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $15.8 billion for the full year. Our strong level of free cash flow includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our business in six broad and diversified growth categories, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity, along with theme parks, streaming, and premium content at our studios. Taken together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue and grew at a high single digit rate during the quarter and for the full year.\nNow let's turn to our business results starting on Slide six with connectivity and platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British Pound, which was up nearly 6% year-over-year as usual. In order to highlight the underlying performance of the connectivity and platforms business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Unpacking that revenue in our core connectivity business, domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThank you, Operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website, and which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. It was another strong quarter for us, with adjusted EBITDA up 5% and adjusted EPS up 13%. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow, which, combined with our expectation of Hulu proceeds in the near future, contributed to a pickup in our share of purchases to $3.5 billion in the quarter. Our steady performance has been a direct result of how we've always run our company, which is with a focus on industry-leading performance both operationally and financially in each of our businesses, combined with a long-term, customer-centric approach to decision-making that ensures each business is positioned to win in the future. This has all been facilitated by a philosophy of investment in our businesses that has remained consistent through different economic and credit cycles, and particularly through the recent global pandemic.\nNow, I'd like to highlight four areas in the quarter that show how this strategy is playing out before handing it over to Jason to review this quarter's results in full. The first area I'd like to highlight is residential domestic connectivity, where we are very pleased with our performance and strategy as we navigate a highly competitive broadband marketplace. The customer experience provided by our broadband network, which has ubiquitously available gig speeds today and is on a path to ubiquitous multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, combined with our wireless offering through our MVNO with Verizon and our own network of over 20 million Wi-Fi hotspots, enables us to provide world-class connectivity both in and out of the home to all of our customers everywhere in the most cost-effective and capital-efficient manner versus our competition.\nOur broadband network and product leadership continue to drive strong residential revenue growth, which was up nearly 4% this quarter, fueled by very strong ARPU growth of 3.9%. We're confident in our ability to drive continued ARPU growth because of our focus on constantly improving the product experience through investment and innovation, thus delivering more value to our customers.\nHaving a truly excellent internet experience, as reflected in speed, reliability, coverage, security, and latency, is constantly increasing in importance to all households as a result of the consumer experiences it enables. One of the biggest catalysts for recent growth in data usage is the accelerating transition of sports viewership to streaming platforms. The switch of a single Thursday night NFL game to streaming moved peak data usage on our broadband network from Sunday night to Thursday night, and that game comprises roughly 25% of all internet traffic on Thursday nights.\nEvery internet service provider, fixed wireless in particular, will really be put to the test as this transition of sports to streaming continues, especially come January, when, for the first time ever, an NFL playoff game will be aired exclusively on a streaming platform, which will be our very own Peacock. The second item I'll highlight is Peacock, which added 4 million paying subscribers during the quarter, saw greater than 60% revenue growth versus a year ago, and had the first year-over-year improvement in EBITDA since our launch in 2020. While we report standalone Peacock metrics given the significance of this initiative, we manage it as part of the broader NBCU media segment, which includes the broadcast and cable networks, to best leverage the advantages we bring to the streaming landscape.\nWe continue to be pleased with our progress in the few short years since we've pivoted our streaming strategy as a result of the ownership changes at Hulu. Looking ahead, we are sticking to our plans and still expect 2023 to be the peak year of EBITDA losses for Peacock, though we are now expecting 2023 Peacock losses to come in around $2.8 versus our original 3 billion loss outlook. And for 2024, we expect to show meaningful EBITDA improvement over 2023. The third area to highlight is our parks business, which generated a record-high level of EBITDA, surpassing the previous record that we just set in Q2. The reaction to Nintendo and Hollywood in Japan continues to be fantastic, and we are very excited about bringing the experience to Florida soon.\nI was just in Orlando with the parks leadership team last week, reviewing our plans for the new Halloween horror experience in Las Vegas and kids' theme park in Frisco, Texas. I also spent a few hours on a site tour of the Epic Universe Park, which is deep in construction and is simply breathtaking. So thanks to the momentum of our Q3 results and what we have in the pipeline, I could not be more excited about our parks business. The final area to highlight is our studios business, which is having a great year with three of the top five box office hits for the year so far in Super Mario Bros., Fast X, and now Oppenheimer, which grossed more than $900 million in worldwide box office in Q3 and became the highest-grossing biopic of all time.\nThis is a continuation of our solid track record where, since 2020, we've had at least two of the top five movies in worldwide box office. We believe that success in this business is not formulaic. It's a craft rooted in creativity and originality. We've long focused on assembling a team of the most innovative filmmakers, Christopher Nolan, Chris Meledandri, Steven Spielberg, Jason Blum, and Jordan Peele, to name a few, which positions us very well for the future in the studios business. More broadly, it is our consistent investment approach through past business cycles and the pandemic that is the reason for much of the success we're experiencing today. We remain steadfast in supporting our businesses, even those that were hit hard during that time period.\nFor example, in studios, we never stopped believing that people want to experience great films in theaters, and that conviction enabled us to attract new partners like Chris Nolan, who made a masterpiece in Oppenheimer. Similarly, while our parks business was closed or at limited capacity, we continue to invest heavily in our existing parks, including the VelociCoaster in Orlando, Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood, and the Nintendo Lands I mentioned earlier in Los Angeles and Osaka, and we will be bringing Epic Universe to life in 2025. Our strong investment-grade balance sheet enabled these investments and puts us in a strong and enviable position today. Now, the business world must deal with the pressures of much higher interest rates, which I believe will asymmetrically advantage us given our low leverage and the long duration of our debt.\nSince the end of 2018, we have refinanced over $40 billion, or nearly 40% of our debt obligations, reduced net debt from $108 to 88 billion today, lowered net leverage by a full turn from 3.3 to 2.3 x, increased the average life of our debt by more than four years to 17 years, while reducing the weighted average cost of our debt to 3.6% from 3.8%. Today, 97% of our debt is at fixed rates compared to just 82% at the end of 2018. We accomplished this while at the same time returning $45 billion to shareholders, including $24 billion via share repurchases and $21 billion in dividends. To sum up, we're in a great place, especially given how the competitive dynamics in our industry might evolve in this higher-for-longer interest rate environment.\nI expect that our focus on building businesses that are market leaders for the long term through strong execution, investment, and innovation will keep us in one of the strongest positions to perform for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our strong Q3, and we'll begin with our consolidated financials on slide four. Revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 5% to $10 billion. Our results were driven by six key growth areas we have highlighted this year: our connectivity businesses, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity; our theme parks; streaming; and premium content in our studios. Together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter and grew at a high single-digit rate over the past 12 months. The growth in these areas, which on the whole are margin accretive, coupled with disciplined cost management, drove our EBITDA growth and contributed to our adjusted earnings per share increasing 13% to $1.08.\nLast, we generated $4 billion of Free Cash Flow while returning $4.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Now, let's turn to our individual business results, starting on slide five with connectivity and platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was up nearly 8% year-over-year. So, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.3 billion. Our core connectivity businesses: domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity, increased 7% to $11 billion in revenue, while video, advertising, and other revenue declined 6% to $10 billion in revenue. We're focused on investing in and driving growth in high-margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management.\nIt's working, underscored by the 100 basis points of margin expansion for connectivity and platforms in Q3, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 160 basis points to 46.6%. Getting more into the details, residential connectivity revenue was up 7.5%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 16% growth in domestic wireless, and 25% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue was up 5%. Domestic broadband revenue growth continued to be driven by very strong ARPU, which grew 3.9%. Our commitment to network leadership and delivering it ubiquitously across our footprint enables customers to do more on our network. They're using more data and connecting more devices at faster speeds, which provides them with increasing value and underpins our ability to drive ARPU higher this year and beyond.\nAt the same time, our residential broadband base remained stable, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, with voluntary churn at record-low levels for Q3. While back-to-school was a tailwind, as expected, the broadband market remains highly competitive, particularly at the lower end. During the quarter, we recalibrated by pulling back on some of our promotional offers targeting this segment to remain consistent with our strategy of competing aggressively but in a financially disciplined way. This means striking what we believe to be the appropriate balance between broadband subscriber growth and ARPU growth. And as we continue to manage this balance, we expect ARPU growth to remain strong and our primary driver of broadband revenue growth, with somewhat higher subscriber losses expected in Q4 compared to the 18,000 loss we just reported in Q3.\nWe expect subscriber trends to improve over time as we remain focused on network and product leadership, and also as we see the benefits of greater footprint expansion. We've grown our homes and businesses passed by 1.5% year-over-year to 62 million, and we're on pace to meet or exceed our goal of one million new homes and businesses passed for 2023. This is a material step up from 2022, and we should accelerate this again in 2024. Domestic wireless revenue increased due to higher service revenue, driven by strong momentum in customer lines, which were up 1.3 million, or 27% year-over-year, to over 6 million in total. This includes 294,000 lines we just added in Q4. We continue to test some new converged offers, which, along with the new iPhone launch, should translate into accelerated line additions in Q4.\nWith still only about 10% penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer accounts, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue increased 25% to another record high, driven by steady mid-teens growth in broadband, with the remainder driven by wireless, reflecting healthy growth in services and a particularly strong quarter of device sales. The 5% growth in business services connectivity revenue reflects stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market. The strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, advertising, and other revenue. Video revenue decline was driven by continued customer losses. The lower other revenue reflects similar dynamics in wireline voice, and advertising was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets, which in Q4 will face an even more challenging comparison to last year.\nConnectivity and platforms' total EBITDA increased 3% to $8.2 billion, with adjusted margin up 100 basis points, again driven by the mixed shift to our high-margin connectivity businesses, coupled with expense management. Continuing the trends seen in the first half of the year, every line item of expense improved year-over-year, except for direct product costs. These are success-based and tied to the growth in our connectivity businesses. In terms of the breakout in our connectivity and platforms' EBITDA results, residential EBITDA grew 2.4%, with margin improving 110 basis points to reach 38.4%, driven by our favorable mixed shift. While business EBITDA increased 3.6%, EBITDA margin declined 60 basis points to 57.5%, reflecting investments we're making in sales capacity to drive growth in the mid-market and enterprise segments. Now, let's turn to content and experiences on slide six.\nContent and experiences revenue increased 1% to $10.6 billion, and EBITDA increased 10% to $2 billion, driven by record results at parks as well as an improvement in year-over-year Peacock EBITDA losses. Looking at the results of each segment, I'll start with media, which combines our TV networks and Peacock, given we manage this as one portfolio. Revenue was slightly higher, as strong growth in Peacock offset the challenging performance at our linear networks. Unpacking that further, domestic advertising declined 8%, reflecting softness in the linear market, partially offset by growth at Peacock, which increased nearly 40%. Domestic distribution increased 4%, driven by Peacock subscription revenue growth of nearly 90% as we continue to grow our paid subscriber base. We ended the quarter with 28 million Peacock paid subscribers, compared to 16 million a year ago, with 4 million net additions in the quarter.\nThis result was driven by continued success in converting free Comcast bundled subscribers to a paid relationship, as well as organic growth driven by programming, including the start of the NFL season and having the Big Ten for the first time, as well as Super Mario Bros. landing exclusively on Peacock in our pay-one window. Media expenses were slightly lower, reflecting effective cost management in our linear networks and the timing of Premier League costs, partially offset by higher Peacock expenses. This resulted in a 6.5% increase in media EBITDA, with consistent EBITDA at our TV networks and improved year-over-year Peacock losses for the first time. As Mike noted, we believe Peacock's financial performance will continue to improve and now expect full-year 2023 losses will come in at around $2.8 billion, better than our previous outlook of $3 billion.\nHowever, keep in mind that in Q4, we expect our overall media EBITDA results to be impacted by higher sports costs, reflecting a full quarter of the contractual rate increase in our NFL programming, the addition of Big Ten to our sports programming lineup, and higher Premier League costs compared to last year, when games were paused for four weeks to accommodate the timing of the World Cup. Turning to studios, Oppenheimer had a strong theatrical performance, delivering over $900 million at the box office. This success, coupled with the positive benefits from carryover titles from our strong film slate this year, resulted in EBITDA of $429 million.\nWhile this is a tough comparison to last year's Q3, which was driven by the strong performance of both Minions: The Rise of Gru, and Jurassic World: Dominion, it still ranks as one of the highest EBITDA quarters in the history of studios. At theme parks, revenue increased 17%, and EBITDA increased 20% to $983 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record. Our international parks continue to experience nice rebounds post-COVID. Leading this growth was Osaka, which benefited from strong demand from Super Nintendo World, and our park in Beijing achieved another EBITDA record, driven by increases in attendance and per capita spending. In Hollywood, the positive consumer reaction to Super Nintendo World, which we opened earlier this year, drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarterly EBITDA in its history.\nIn Orlando, our results were also strong, with attendance relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels and revenue substantially ahead. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide seven. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments concentrated in our domestic broadband network, footprint expansion, streaming, and theme parks. Total capital spending increased 16%, driven by higher CapEx, which remains within the envelope of the guidance we gave at the beginning of this year, including connectivity and platforms' CapEx intensity to remain at around 10% and parks' CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion for the full year compared to 2022. At connectivity and platforms, CapEx in the quarter decreased slightly to $2.1 billion, with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.3%.\nThe year-over-year decline was due to lower spending in customer premise equipment and support capital, which more than offset the investments we are making to accelerate our growth in homes past, as well as to transition our US network to DOCSIS 4.0. Content and experiences CapEx increased by $270 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. Working capital was fairly neutral in the quarter and improved by nearly a $1 billion year-over-year, with more than half of this improvement reflecting the pause in production during the work stoppages associated with the writers' and actors' strikes. We expect this benefit in working capital to reverse as we ramp up to our normal levels of production in the coming quarters.\nTurning to return to capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $3.5 billion worth of our shares in the quarter, a step up in our quarterly run rate relative to the first half of the year. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, for a total return to capital in Q3 of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.3 times, in line with our target leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press Star, then the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press Star and the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, press Star, then the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nHead of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Two questions for the team on the cable business or connectivity business. Jason, as you mentioned, expenses continue to be a nice tailwind for growth. I think investors are focused on your ability to sustain that. You've been delivering kind of low to mid-single-digit EBITDA growth in connectivity. Can you keep this up with expenses as a driver over the next couple of years, or do you need revenue to accelerate?\nMaybe just talk about the opportunity you see ahead for the company. And then I'm just wondering, you teased it a little bit with the iPhone commentary, but what's the thought process around getting more aggressive in wireless? Do you want to avoid pressuring financials at all? Because it would seem like wireless and the potential for wireless to bring broadband growth up to higher levels has got to be something you guys are thinking about. So I'd love to just hear your considerations on that front. Thank you.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast\n\nHey, Ben. Good morning. It's Jason. Let me start with the margin and expense question on the connectivity side. I think you're right. We've been sort of consistently expanding margins. A large part of that is we had yet another quarter, as we mentioned in the upfront remarks, where every expense line item went backwards or declined year-over-year, which is a positive outside of direct network costs. And just as a reminder, those are costs that directly feed into our key growth businesses like broadband and wireless. So as we look forward, I think the construct is, and you sort of laid this out appropriately, we've got several revenue growth drivers within our connectivity business, namely residential broadband, wireless, and business services.\nThose are the higher-margin businesses within all of connectivity and platforms. So the mixed shift that we're seeing and undergoing, where those are the businesses that are growing against businesses that are not growing, has been a favorable mixed shift for us, and we expect it to continue to be a favorable mixed shift. So I'd look for continued opportunities in both expense and margin.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nAnd I would just add, it's Mike, Ben, that on the other, as Jason's pointed out, the six growth driver businesses, the cable components of that are all high incremental margin, next dollar revenue, very high incremental margin. But there's also the businesses that are, as we've talked about, are not in the six growth drivers that are being managed pretty aggressively, frankly, for continued ways to find efficiencies to offset the pressures on the top line. So we've got multiple things going on that I think are the tailwinds for continued ability to drive margins.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nThis is Dave. Yeah, And as both Jason and Mike said, it does start when you talk about margins with the top line. And so there's real focus around healthy ARPU, total revenue growth, and connectivity. So all those things really, I think, are sustainable. And you go through a competitive phase like we are, but you've still got to keep your eye on the ball. And we believe that over time, in addition to driving good, healthy, making financially disciplined calls along the way, we will return to subscriber growth over time. And so I think you add all that up, that's the beginning part. Then your question on mobile, it's such an important part of our strategy. It has been. We built up the business, had consistent performance, and believe strongly we had a long runway ahead.\nOne of the things that we're doing just to showcase kind of the focus for us is we are rolling out a buy one, get one offer. It scaled up at the very end of Q3. It's really kicking off in earnest in Q4. It's a straightforward, good, solid offer that'll be accretive and will drive broadband benefits. In doing so, we're starting with the base. It's just an example that in both residential and in small business, we'll continue to be very, I think, very aggressive in mobile over time. A lot more to come on mobile, but we're encouraged and really like the runway ahead.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. I'm going to go to a different place, actually, Xumo. Maybe, Brian, if you could talk a little bit about this from a high-level kind of strategic point of view. There's been a lot of talk about the prospect for streaming services being rebundled into something that maybe is in some ways closer to what we used to have in the video world. I wonder if you could just talk about that a little bit and talk about how Xumo might fit into that and whether you think Xumo has the potential to actually become a meaningful part of your connectivity and platforms business.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nThank you. Great question. Good morning, everybody. We're really excited about Xumo and the progress that we've made, that we're making together now with Charter. And it's an amazing platform that started with X1, but now will be in televisions, it'll be in devices, and it'll be all over the nation and, frankly, all over the world. The heart and soul of it is our entertainment operating system, which is global, that includes Sky, all of Canada, Cox, and a number of other distributors that we've now gradually built up to all be helping to finance and help the innovation roadmap. So what is that innovation roadmap? It's really, like you're suggesting, what do customers really want? They want a great platform, a great pipe.\nThey want world-class content that they customize, and they want someone to make it really simple for them and do the heavy lifting as you bounce in between services. And that is what we really built our company on all these years and this industry on. So, it is somewhat ironic that we've unbundled to rebundled to unbundled to rebundle, and everybody has a different version of that, and we're at a moment in time. But a lot of it is having one great platform that now the entire industry has. And thankfully, all of you on this phone who do not live in a Comcast market, which is many, are now soon going to be able to get these products, talk to your voice remote, and see how fantastic the experience is, whether you buy the cable bundle or not. And that's a big point.\nThat is, most of our sales now are broadband only. We want to make sure we are the best aggregator for streaming. And then a logical next step will be us or others beginning to try to make it even easier for consumers to purchase and to switch packages. So it's an important part of the roadmap. And this was a big week in the Charter announcement. And I'm sure in their call, they'll talk about their commitment to the JV as well.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Craig. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nHead of US Telecom Services and Communications Infrastructure, JPMorgan\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. A couple for Dave. Dave, I think you said that you expect to get back to broadband growth over time. As you expand the number of houses that you're building, as Jason mentioned, I expect that that's probably part of it. But can you talk about the contribution of that low-end effort that you started? You mentioned on the first quarter call and the level of reversal that you're doing here, as well as recent competition from fiber and fixed wireless. Then second, if you can just talk about where wireless is right now, how the CBRS trials are going in Philadelphia, and any thoughts on timing to expand that. Thanks very much.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nYou got it, Phil. So as we said, and everybody has seen, it's a pretty competitive environment. And so we have some continuation of some of the macro issues that we've talked about. But we've also, as you brought up, we've also continued to see the expansion of both fiber and fixed wireless footprint. So we've gone through several competitive cycles where it's really noted by a lot of new footprint that's been added. And so we did start in the beginning of the year, made some adjustments in terms of offers that were really focused more on the lower end of the market. But the part of our game plan is we're going to continue to invest in a better network, better products, going to compete aggressively, but we're going to maintain financial discipline. And that means making certain decisions when it comes to balancing rate and volume.\nAfter the first half, we did make the decision to pull back on some of our more aggressive offers, which resulted in lower connect activity. That is the changes that we've had. I think our voluntary churn rate is very healthy, key part of that that's continued. The real issue that we see at this point is, as we manage things, it's just lower connect volume. But net net, we're growing revenues. We talked about earlier, Jason did and I did. We're going to focus on multiple drivers of revenue growth. We'll make our playbook. We make changes throughout. Then to wireless, your point, we are continuing to test in terms of the CBRS rollouts. We've picked up the pace on that, staying close to what Charter is doing.\nWe've seen good progress in the ability to offload traffic, and encouraged by the opportunity in terms of that, just such a small geographic part of your footprint contributes so much volume of wireless traffic. So we are in position if we so choose to do it. But we like where we're at with that. No new news in terms of scaling up on that point, but we're in a good position.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nHead of US Telecom Services and Communications Infrastructure, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, Dave.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Phil. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Her line is now live.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks. I have two topics. One is sports, and one is advertising. On sports, I mean, it's such a key differentiator in content. Can you just talk about your longer-term sports strategy and how you believe sports will be distributed in the future? I mean, you talked about more going direct to consumer. What role will linear play as we look ahead three to five years? And how would you respond to the leagues, whether NBA or NFL, etc., investing in ESPN? And then on advertising, there seems to be weakness across the board, cable and media, which is in line, I'm sure, with the rest of the industry. But there seems to be strength in the industry in digital, whether it's Google or Meta. How are you, as a company/industry, addressing that? How do you get dollars back?\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nOkay. Well, this is Brian. Let me start and kick it over to Mike because I think your industry question on sports is really profound and important. I think our company has had a long, deep, rich history in sports, both parts of the company. The best way to consume an NFL game or the Olympics is to have our entertainment operating system I just talked about in Craig's question. And you'll see that in the Olympics. There'll be nothing like it. The same goes for, I think, NBC Sports, which is number one show on television on Sunday Night Football. We've got a great team and a culture of big events, whether it goes from the Kentucky Derby, which the ratings are much higher when it's been on NBC than any previous platform, and then on and on.\nAnd with Peacock now, we have the most live sports of any of the streaming services. And I believe that that's a surprise to many people when they learn that. And I believe that to be the case. And that's a commitment we made when we had things like the English Premier League, or Tour de France, or golf, or events that went on for longer periods of time than were typically on a network where you wanted more camera angles or more feeds and more games. And that sets us up for being relevant in the transition that we're all talking about. How do we go from analog to digital in a way that helps the leagues?\nYeah, I can't speculate on what might happen to ESPN, but what I could speculate is as we meet with the leagues, which we do frequently, we think we present a somewhat unique ability to help get the maximum engagement now with broadcast and cable, and particularly our broadcast platform, as well as having a robust streaming service in a super quarter here regarding the kind of momentum that we've garnered. A lot of that is driven by sports on Peacock. And that sets you up to answer your advertising question, which I'll let Mike go into a bit. But at the highest level, we're creating the digital capability on Peacock in the most relevant content. That looks like a very winning combination for us as a strategy.\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nI'll just add on that, Mike. I'll just add that the importance and the significance of us being committed to sports in the streaming context of Peacock is, for us, combined with the ability to bring the big reach that our broadcaster, NBC, brings to the party, which I think is an important element of while sports over the long term, I think, are going to be experienced significantly through streaming. I think for a long time, the economics of the sports rights that you see is going to be substantially supported by broadcast reach that I think for a long time is going to continue to be a significant part of the picture. In terms of advertising, I'd say, Jessica, that overall, it's not a big difference in story than last quarter. I'd say the ad market has remained soft.\nIt hasn't necessarily gotten worse despite a little bit of sequential decline, but it hasn't gotten better at the same time. We still continue to think it's due to the general uncertainty about economic conditions that are out there. The kind of weakness that we're talking about or the softness is particularly on the Linear side, while Peacock has remained very strong. Picking at this quarter a little bit, the deceleration from 5% to 8%, contributing factor there, which is a little idiosyncratic, is while the retail and tech sectors were down a little bit, whereas auto, pharma, and consumer products were up, the one that was down that's a little unique and idiosyncratic is entertainment, where you had streamers spending a little less together with advertisers given the strikes, looking at what the lineups were in the recent past and putting some money in other places.\nSo some of that will revert, we believe, once strikes are over. As we look to Q4, last year's World Cup, as well as political, that underlying ad sales will be an improvement in this Q4 versus last year's Q4. As far as digital, I mean, I think that's why there's definitely the opportunity that some tech competitors are capturing to get premium video monetized in digital platforms. I think that speaks to why we consider Peacock to be an important initiative for us. We're pleased, again, with the progress we're making in Peacock, which is now north of 28 million subs and strong overall 60% revenue growth year-over-year.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nOne last point that I just wanted to add, that one of the great things about sports that we're very excited about is streaming sports and what that means for our broadband network strategy that Dave was just talking about. Dave and the team, I think, have found a great balance in how we're running the operation. But a big part of that is a commitment and a belief that we see all sports finding a way over the next many years, or maybe not so many years, to be more and more streamed. That's going to require more bandwidth, and that's going to require and create an opportunity for us to have the superior product in the market. So that's our strategy. Sports, really, back to your first question, Jessica, is at the heart and soul of a lot of what we do.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. I got two questions about your business connectivity segment. The first is you made some comments about investments you're making to better address the enterprise customer demographic. I think the assumption has been historically it's not been a focus for you because serving that demo generally requires you to serve customers with locations outside of your footprint. So I was curious to hear a little more about your strategy for scaling up there. And I'm wondering whether that might involve making incremental investments in your connectivity platform outside of your region, either organically or potentially making some acquisitions. And then second, I was hoping you'd give us an update on the extent to which the business segment is contributing to your success in wireless. Is it kind of pacing what you're seeing in the residential space, or do you think you have more opportunity there? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nHey, Brett, Dave. So let me start. The overall business services had a very good quarter. Revenue accelerated a little, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market. So we've been very focused on growing all categories. So your point on the sales investment, let me provide some context. We have been for some time working with partners, and most certainly with the acquisition of Masergy. We've been expanding our capability to go into other areas. And now we have global opportunity to be able to handle customers. The key here is to be able to take care of customers' needs wherever they are. So this particular investment is just adding some folks. It's not infrastructure that we're building out there. We will leverage the partnerships that we have, but certainly we'll deliver products that meet the customer's needs out.\nBut it's sales force and adding some people that can drive mid-market and enterprise where the customer's locations are. But we'll continue to partner. We've got great partnerships with Charter, Cox, and many others, and we'll continue to do that. It's not really an infrastructure moment. In terms of wireless, it's a very important part of business services. Clearly, this phase is centered on SMB, and we're getting going on that. We picked up the pace on that. It's not a major driver yet, an overall mobile activity at this point, but we expect that pace to pick up. That is an important one for us. Just one last point, if I could, Brett, while you're talking about business services, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank Bill Stemper as he transitions to chairman emeritus.\nBill has been a spectacular teammate and driver of this business over a long stretch, really. One of the great things that Bill did is build a world-class team. I think they've set the bar in terms of performance. We continue to do that. Part of that team is a wonderful executive, Ed Zimmermann, who has now taken over the running business services for us. Congratulations to both.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Brett. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Two, if I could. First of all, and maybe for Dave, can I just get your thoughts on the Charter approach to the Disney renewal? Do you see Comcast heading in that direction, or do you see benefits for the industry and for Linear TV if the industry does move in that direction? And then following up on some of your comments on the broadband side, you guys are rolling out DOCSIS 4.0. I know you're starting to sign up customers. I guess, one, could you just update us on the timing of that rollout? And two, do you see it more as an ARPU opportunity or a sub-opportunity, a subscriber growth opportunity? And I guess lastly on that, you said there's more competition at the low end of the broadband market. Is there any way you could quantify either Comcast's exposure to the low end or how big the low end of the market in broadband is?\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nThank you, John. I think Mike and Brian talked about what Charter and Disney do. So to me, I think that has provided the point of view. From my perspective, I think every situation is unique. I think we are in a very unique position because of the platform that we have and the fact that we are in the streaming business as a company. But we have great relationships with content providers, and we have a way of figuring things out. But it'll be case by case as they come up, and we'll see. But a big part of it, one of the things we talked about, is value. The value of the content and how that model evolves, we'll figure it out. But I think we are in a good position to be a bridge builder as we go consider each one of these options in the marketplace.\nIn terms of the network and DOCSIS, let me give you a sense, John, where we're at. So we're about 30% in terms of mid-splits and really focused on this seamless integration that connects HFC to fiber. We'll be at 40% next year. Then we started, you've seen the announcement, and we talked about the deployment of DOCSIS 4.0 needs. So we're going to continue to drive the mid-split upgrade areas. The DOCSIS 4.0 follows that mid-split trajectory. That is our focus, continued focus, is just providing leadership of where the market's going. The reason why, to answer your question, in terms of where do we see the benefits, it's that point that the market is going to continue, whether it's the sports discussion we talked about earlier, as more and more things start to perhaps go to streaming.\nThere'll be more simultaneous contention at peak moments. We're in a great position with the network. So having the ability to have faster speeds, ubiquitous network coverage at scale, the most efficient network, and effectively delivering. We got customers that are 1 Gb today. 70% of our customers are 400 Mb or higher. We see where things are going. I think the answer is both. I think over time, it's customer relationships as it's going to become increasingly harder for some of the competition to keep up in terms of they have to make network trade-offs and fix wireless in particular. To me, it's both rate and volume. The last point is just on the lower end. It was a lot of activity in the lower end. We did respond in Q1 but made adjustments for second half.\nSo I think I've talked about that. And I would just say on the Charter and Disney, what I think it was in sort of the first question I answered, we think there's a, not to echo what Dave said, not one size fits all, very glad, happy for both companies that they figured something out, good for consumers. Each situation is slightly different. What I think is important for us is finding a way to help our customers have a great network, aggregate the content, and have access to the great content. And I think we're really well positioned to do that. And we're looking forward to executing upon that.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nThanks, guys. Maybe for Dave, just a small question following on from Phil's. In terms of the CBRS trials, is the benefit that you're seeing there that you're sort of more enthusiastic about primarily on the cost side from being able to offload traffic, or is there a product benefit as well? And then with the sale of the 600 megahertz spectrum, does that sort of suggest that you're not really interested in owning any spectrum besides 600 megahertz? Or was there sort of something, sorry, besides CBRS, was there something specific about 600 megahertz in the portfolio that you had that made it non-strategic? And then if you can give us just a quick update on where your sort of average usage is on broadband, that'd be helpful as well. Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nThank you, Jonathan. So in terms of CBRS, it's what I said before, that we're in position. It's an option for us. We're in a good position. We like where we're at with our current deal, the MVNO, capital light approach, everything that we talked about is consistent. But we've always been very interested in the benefit of CBRS is on the cost side. And that if you have, again, 3% of your geographic footprint that's delivering 60% of the traffic, that's a good option. And if we can figure out how to do that. So that's what's really driving it. But we've always been very focused on how to build a better overall wireless experience. We have, I think, great Wi-Fi capability in addition to CBRS, if that is something that we want to do.\nBut the key for CBRS is that we just want to be in position and doing it without a massive amount of CapEx to be able to deliver that smaller geographic area. In regards to 600, it was an opportunity to get value for areas of the country outside of our areas. It just made sense to, it was a good transaction for us and not something that we're going to build outside of our footprint.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Media and Cable, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. So just first on the residential broadband ARPU, wondering if you could unpack a little bit of the sequential change. I know the big components are double play going to single play from cord cutting, as well as just tiering and pricing. So with a little bit of slowdown sequentially, should we attribute a lot of that to the slowdown in video losses that you saw or anything else going on in there?\nAnd then, Brian, you talked a lot about how effectively you've de-leveraged the balance sheet, taking it down by a full turn over the last couple of years. Also, that a lot of your competitors, especially on the media side, are going to be more challenged. So I know you'll be disciplined in anything you do, but as you look ahead and think about competing against some companies that aren't challenged like Netflix, Apple, and Amazon, how do you think about some of the availability of some of those distressed content creators that might be out there at some future point? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO of Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast\n\nLet me start, Steven. This is Dave. The biggest driver in terms of ARPU was that, in the first half of the year, our focus, we did make adjustments in that first part of the year of being a little bit more aggressive in the lower end. This resulted in a mixed shift among new customers that were coming on. And this caused the deceleration in ARPU growth from where we were before, 4.5% to 3.9%. But 3.9% is still very strong ARPU growth and consistent with our planning and what we were talking about.\nSo that was really the biggest driver. Some certainly benefit over time to a little bit better performance in the video business with NOW TV, which is beginning to pick up the pace. So pleased with that. But it was mostly that refinement of the lower-end offers. You're not going to see that, by the way, that level of deceleration from Q3 to Q4 as we've made those adjustments. It's mostly the tier mix change that I talked about.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast",
    "content2": "Hey, Steven, I would add on to that. Just if you look at the historical context here, we've typically grown broadband ARPU 3% to 4% in any given year. We've been operating at the very high end of that for the first Q3 of this year. Things that contribute to that over the long term, you mentioned sort of the tactical components of that, but really, really, we want to see broadband usage growth. We want to see customers hanging more devices off their network. We want to see them taking higher speeds. And that's exactly what they're doing. So those are sort of the foundational pillars to driving ARPU growth over time. And that's exactly what we're seeing.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast\n\nThis is Brian. I actually will let Mike answer because he did such a great job in his old job as CFO in helping put our balance sheet in this enviable position that he described in his opening or comments about how long the debt is and some of the interest rates. We have a great business. This quarter is another demonstration of it. The start to the year is fantastic. But Mike, why don't you? So therefore, the bar is very high to do anything other than the plan we've got. And we like the company. But Mike, why don't you go into your thoughts on that content question specifically?\n\nMike Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast\n\nSure. Thanks, Brian. So I think if you zoom out, it's much of what I said earlier, Steven, which is I think the strength of our financial position broadly. You think about across all the businesses we're in. I think of us as having leading positions for the customer, but also strong margins benchmarked against any peer you can look at. That together with a strong balance sheet, I think the company couldn't be in better shape financially. I think on the execution side, Dave and his team, and the NBC team that works with me, they know what they're doing. I think we're not giving anybody any quarter in terms of operating the businesses we have. Our priorities, though, in how to use that financial strength is very strategic.\nSo, I think we think about the businesses we're in and investing in them appropriately for return and growth and drive growth in those businesses over the long term. Hence, the way Jason talks about the half the company that's got strong revenue growth. We're trying to find ways to put resources into our own businesses. So that's the priority. As Brian said, the bar is really high for us to consider anything inorganic. But it's our job to look at these things. But if you think about what you call the potentially distressed media assets, I'm not sure which ones you're referring to, but many of them are pretty small and wouldn't change the arc of what our company's all about. So I think our focus is on the total picture, what Comcast looks like, and we're proud of the company we have.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast\n\nThanks, Steve. That concludes our call. I want to thank everyone for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's question and answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time for today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome to our Q2 2023 Earnings Call. You'll first hear from Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong, then Brian Roberts and Dave Watson will join us and be available for Q&A. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our Q2 results, which again demonstrate that our focused efforts to invest and innovate in businesses that offer significant revenue growth while we carefully manage the contiguous areas with structurally lower growth and is paying off. Total revenue grew 2%, and the six growth priority areas we have outlined, residential broadband, wireless, business services, theme parks, streaming, and premium content creation in our studios, grew nearly 10% year-over-year and now represent 55% of total revenue.\nThis revenue growth combined with careful management of margins across all businesses generated mid-single-digit EBITDA growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. Looking farther into the future, we expect to continue to drive significant growth in these areas and to continue to identify and invest in organic growth opportunities across our strong portfolio of businesses. We are also very clear-eyed about the challenges that we and our competitors face in other business lines and have established thoughtful plans which will enable these businesses to continue to meaningfully contribute both financially and strategically.\nImportantly, the net effect of this approach is a path to sustained future revenue growth for the company in total, driving strong earnings and Free Cash Flow growth for what I expect to be many years to come. Significantly, we have by far the strongest balance sheet among our core competitors, which allows us to continue to invest for growth while returning substantial capital to shareholders through both dividends and buybacks, which will drive excellent Free Cash Flow and earnings per share growth. Now let me call out a few highlights from the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, we generated over $10 billion in quarterly EBITDA.\nAnd while the diversification of our businesses means there were several significant contributors, I would highlight three that stand out to me in the quarter and reflect the consistency of our investments and the resulting durability of our growth profile. The first is broadband ARPU growth of 4.5%. Stepping back, I am confident we have a winning hand in convergence. We're the largest broadband provider with a high quality ubiquitous network and the most cost efficient upgrade path to higher speeds. In addition, we can compete effectively in wireless with a capital light approach and a very strong value proposition for our customers.\nWe also have a long history of consistently surrounding our products with industry-leading features and capabilities ranging from the coverage and control aspects of our Wi-Fi experience to content aggregation through our X1 and Flex platforms, which is how we have been able to achieve near record low levels of churn and grow ARPU consistently quarter-after-quarter. This Q2's 4.5% growth was no exception and is a testament to our ability to appropriately balance rate and volume to effectively segment the market and surround our broadband product with industry-leading products and capabilities.\nThe broadband market remains highly competitive, but we have and will continue to invest to sustain our position as a market leader. Second is our parks, which continues to be such a great story for us. Our teams have consistently introduced new and innovative attractions leveraging both our owned or licensed IP. We opened Super Nintendo World at both Universal Hollywood and Japan, which helped drive the record results in the quarter.\nLater this summer, we will be opening a new Minion Land in Orlando, and we look forward to Donkey Kong in Japan next year as well as starting the previously announced kids theme park in Texas and the Halloween horror experience in Las Vegas. I couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe in Orlando in 2025. Third is the strength of our film studios and, in particular, our animation business. Super Mario Bros. crossed over $1.3 billion in worldwide box office to date, making it the second highest grossing animated film ever. This is another incredible achievement by Illumination and Chris Meledandri.\nWe also invest in successful franchises like Fast, highlighted by the successful launch of the latest installment with Fast 10 during the quarter. Of course, we just released Oppenheimer, which grossed about $180 million this past weekend to tremendous acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike. Oppenheimer is such a powerful and impactful movie, and we at Comcast couldn't be more proud to work with Christopher Nolan to bring such an important movie to audiences globally.\nWe have the very best roster of creative partners, and these innovative filmmakers enable us to invest in a strategic slate, which is one of the keys to our continued box office success, where we remain number two in box office year to date. All of these results and accomplishments, from broadband differentiation to studio leadership to our park success, are a function of our focused leadership team, commitment to innovation, strong balance sheet, and disciplined approach to capital allocation.\nAs I look at our company, I'm extremely bullish on the durability of growth drivers we've invested in so consistently and in our continued ability to invest and deliver through a variety of businesses and economic cycles. This was also my Q1 with direct responsibility for NBCUniversal. As I observed in a note announcing some organizational changes a few weeks ago, NBCU is a very special place with tremendous opportunities ahead.\nI could not be more impressed with the depth of talent and particularly with our leadership team, and I am very confident that the new streamlined organization we have just put in place and which has been very well received will help us move even faster and make even better decisions. As you know, NBCU operates a diverse array of businesses, each with leading market positions. In addition to film and parks which I referenced earlier, we have the number one TV portfolio by total audience, and our TV studio is award-winning and prolific.\nWe're the number one most watched news organization in the US, and sports continues to be a huge driver with the NFL, NASCAR, golf, Premier League, the World Cup on Telemundo, including the Women's World Cup going on right now, Big Ten starting this fall, and the Paris Olympics coming up next year. I am also confident that we have the right strategy for the future. We produce premium content through our studios, distribute it through our TV networks, Peacock, and third parties, and further monetize this content with our theme parks and consumer products. In streaming, we launched Peacock as an ad-supported model that is an extension of our existing business.\nWe set out a plan which we have adapted as needed, and Peacock is strong and growing. We gained 2 million paid subscribers in Q2, going from 22 million to 24 million paid subscribers. This growth was largely driven by conversion of Comcast subs to paying relationships which started in June, and we're very pleased with the results so far. Without a doubt, consumer trends such as cord cutting and new competitors, particularly from the technology sector, present challenges for us, and we are facing an uncertain macro environment which continues to pressure linear advertising.\nBut I firmly believe that we have the business strategy, management, depth, and financial strength to emerge as long-term winners and value creators as the landscape evolves at NBCUniversal and across the company. Another challenge in the near term are the writers and actors strikes. We remain committed to reaching a fair deal as soon as possible so we can get back to doing what we do best, which is making great content together. With that, let me turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a really strong Q2, and to take you through it, I'll start with our consolidated results on slide four. Revenue increased 2% to $30.5 billion while adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $10.2 billion, a record level driven by continued operating leverage at our high-margin connectivity and platforms business as well as strong growth at studios and theme parks. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $1.13 and generated $3.4 billion of Free Cash Flow while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders.\nOur healthy level of Free Cash Flow in the quarter includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our businesses in six key growth areas: our connectivity businesses, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity, theme parks, streaming, and premium content in our studios. Taken together, these areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter and grew nearly 10% year-over-year, consistent with the Q1. Now let's turn to our individual business results starting on slide five with connectivity and platforms.\nAs I get into these results, I'll refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Our core connectivity businesses, domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity, increased 7% to over $10 billion in revenue, while video advertising and other revenue declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Our strategy continues to incorporate a strong focus on investing in and driving growth in high margin businesses, while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management.\nThis resulted in 170 basis points of margin expansion for connectivity and platforms in the Q2, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 240 basis points, reaching a record high of 47.3%. Diving deeper into the details, first, I'll unpack connectivity revenue growth. Residential connectivity revenue grew by 8%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 20% growth in wireless, and 26% growth in international, while revenue for business services connectivity grew 4%. Domestic broadband continued to be led by very strong ARPU growth, which increased 4.5% for the second consecutive quarter.\nAs we have said before, our goal is to protect ARPU by retaining the appropriate balance between rate and volume and to serve our customers constant demand for more from our network. We continue to see the use cases for better and faster internet increase. Demand for higher speeds is increasing as is average network consumption, and our customers are hanging more devices off our network in their homes. The average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 GB and continues to grow. In fact, this is nearly 70% more than the average usage from the comparable quarter in 2019 pre-pandemic.\nAdditionally, nearly 3/4 of our broadband customers are now on speed plans of 400 Mbps and above. That's up from less than 50% last year, and less than 20% in 2020. We plan for our network and product capabilities to stay far ahead of demand so that we maintain our position as a market leader delivering the best broadband possible. To that end, our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is progressing well. We're more than halfway through the year and have implemented our mid-split technology to 25% of our footprint and are on target to complete 1/3 of this build by year-end.\nWith the first commercial launch of DOCSIS 4.0 in just a few short months, we're also hard at work when it comes to expanding our footprint. We've grown our homes and businesses passed by 1.5% year-over-year to 61.8 million, and we are on pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses passed for 2023, with future footprint expansion remaining a high priority. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was due to higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up 1.4 million or 30% year-over-year to 6 million in total, including the 316,000 lines we just added in the quarter.\nThis marked the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 300,000 line additions. We continued testing some new converged offers in the quarter and were encouraged by an increasing mix of new customers to Comcast, and we'll continue to experiment with different offers over time. With just 10% of our domestic residential broadband customers taking our mobile offering, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue grew to $1 billion, a record high, and demonstrates the strength of the Sky brand and the ability to leverage a leadership position in video and extend that to connectivity with significant success.\nBroadband, which accounts for 2/3 of international connectivity revenue, continued to grow at a mid-teens level, benefiting from both an increase in customers and ARPU compared to a year ago. The remainder is wireless revenue, which tends to have more variable growth due to handsets, which contributed to the higher growth rate this quarter. Finally, on business services, connectivity revenue increased 4%, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market, and a slight deceleration in growth from small business, where we are seeing a bit of macroeconomic pressure.\nThe strong revenue growth overall in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, due to customer losses since last year, as well as declines in other revenue, reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice, and finally in advertising, which was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets and the macro environment. Connectivity and platform's total EBITDA increased 4% to $8.3 billion, and as I mentioned a moment ago, an adjusted margin that expanded 170 basis points.\nThis was driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses coupled with very strong expense management. In fact, every line of expense was down year-over-year except direct product costs, which are success based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. Further unpacking our connectivity and platforms EBITDA results between residential and business, residential EBITDA grew 4% with margin improving 180 basis points to reach 38.9%, again highlighting our favorable mix shift, while business EBITDA grew 5% with margin improving 40 basis points to reach 57.7%.\nNow let's turn to content and experiences on slide six. Content and experiences revenue increased 4% to $10.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 7.5% to $2.2 billion driven by record results at parks and strong growth at studios fueled by the success of Super Mario Bros. Taking a closer look at the results, our media segment combines our TV networks and Peacock, matching our holistic approach to managing these businesses as viewership shifts to streaming. Our dual revenue strategy at Peacock, where we're growing advertising and distribution revenue, is offsetting declines in linear revenue.\nAt the same time, we are managing costs at our linear networks and reallocating some of these resources to Peacock with the goal of maximizing profitability over the long term across our media portfolio. You see that in our media results this quarter with stable revenue as strong growth in Peacock offset the performance at our linear networks. Media EBITDA decreased 18%, which included a $651 million EBITDA loss at Peacock.\nTo get a little further into the details, domestic advertising declined 5% with underlying trends consistent to prior quarters reflecting continued softness in the overall market partially offset by strong growth in advertising at Peacock, which increased over 75% driven by strong demand. We expect these overall results in advertising to continue in the third quarter. Domestic distribution increased 2% driven by Peacock distribution revenue growth of nearly 70%. Peacock paid subscribers landed at 24 million compared to 13 million a year ago, and 22 million at the end of the Q1.\nAs Mike mentioned, in June we began an effort to transition Comcast bundled subscribers who receive Peacock for free to a paid relationship. We've made some nice progress to date as the conversion activity drove Peacock's Q2 subscriber growth, and we're bullish on further increasing our Peacock subscriber base through the balance of 2023, driven by both our continued conversion efforts as well as strong programming in the second half.\nSome highlights include a strong lineup of movies exclusively on Peacock in our pay-one window, including Super Mario Bros. coming 3 August 2023, a day-and-date Blumhouse Five Nights at Freddy's coming at the end of October, and continued benefits from our next-day broadcast and Bravo content along with a strong sports lineup including Sunday Night Football and, for the first time, Big Ten. Turning to Studios, we had a great quarter driven by our film business, including the latest installment of the Fast franchise and the tremendous success of Super Mario Bros.\nWhile theatrical revenue growth was offset by lower content licensing at our television studios due to the timing of when we deliver content, the momentum in our film business led by the success of Mario fueled nearly $260 million in year-over-year growth in studio EBITDA. At theme parks, revenue increased 22% and EBITDA increased 32% to $833 million, a record level. Our park in Hollywood continued its momentum from opening Super Nintendo World last quarter. The positive consumer reaction drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarterly EBITDA in its history.\nOur international parks are both experiencing nice rebounds post-COVID. Our park in Osaka delivered a record level of EBITDA for a Q2 as it continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World. Our park in Beijing enjoyed its most profitable quarter to date, resulting in strong improvement compared to last year when the park was largely closed due to COVID. In Orlando, our comparisons were impacted by unprecedented levels of visitation last year, but underlying momentum remains healthy as attendance was relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels, while revenue was substantially ahead of 2019 levels.\nI'll now wrap up with Free Cash Flow and capital allocation on slide seven. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.4 billion in Free Cash Flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 20% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx, which was consistent with the outlook that we provided on our last quarter call. At connectivity and platforms, CapEx increased 11% with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.4%.\nPrimarily driven by investments to accelerate our growth in homes passed as well as transition our US network to DOCSIS 4.0 content and experiences. CapEx increased by $344 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. Turning to return of capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in Q2 of $3.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.4x in line with our target leverage with that. Let me turn it over to Brian for a few words before we turn the call back to Marci.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. I'm really pleased with our team and this outstanding performance for the first half of the year. It was a terrific quarter on all the great metrics you've just articulated. So, I'd like to just zoom out a bit, and probably what's most exciting is the hopefully recurring and sustainable model that we're able to leverage our faster growing businesses, which you laid out, to generate revenue growth for the entire company, and then we convert that all the way to Free Cash Flow Per Share that accelerates with the strength of our company and our balance sheet. I really couldn't be more proud of the team excited about the future. So, Marci, let's turn it over to you for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, let's open up the call please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star and then the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star and the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if there are any questions, please press star and the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning. Question on broadband and then one on NBC. Maybe for Mike and Dave. When you think about the converged offers you have in the market, I know you've been testing more, the investments in the network. Those tailwinds against sort of the headwinds around competition, housing, fixed wireless. When you put that all together, how are you feeling about the ability for the company to return to consistent broadband customer growth, particularly when you look into maybe the seasonally stronger back half or into next year.\nThen Mike, you mentioned the strikes. There's a lot of different ways that those could impact your business depending on how long it lasts. But I'm particularly interested in Free Cash Flow for the company and also Peacock. There's a lot of expectations around Peacock. Profitability improving or losses coming down, and continued growth. When you put the strike into context for us, how should we be thinking about the impact? Should this last longer than expected? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey Ben, this is Dave. Let me start with broadband and hand it over to Mike. I think, talking about this environment, you've got to start where the market is and where the customer is going. And the customers continue to be highly engaged in multiple broadband applications: streaming, gaming, all trending up. And you look at the other thing that is happening, just an increasing number of simultaneous device usage that's happening in peak moments. And now we have over a billion connected devices, Wi-Fi connected devices to our network. So that's, from an overall perspective, that's just very encouraging.\nAnd you look at the results. Non-video broadband customers are doing more than 700 GB per month. And you take one key area, one major streaming part of the business, and that's sports. And it starts with just making it really easy to find the sporting event. So great voice search that we have on our platform, multiple ways to consume sports and linear DVR streaming all seamlessly connected. And then of course comes when big sports moments happen. You want reliability, fast speeds, great coverage, and capacity. And you look at just what happened Thursday Night Football, Messi and MLS. Peacock has a fantastic sports slate that will be streamed and consumed that way.\nSo you need great broadband to be able to back all of that up. And so I think that's a great driver over time. But in this environment we are seeing continued lower move activity, competition is still increased and fixed wireless you brought out, they're still pressing. However, we are seeing some rational promotional activity. It's early, no changes to any trending. But when you see that in the competitive environment that is encouraging. Both voluntary and nonpaid churn remain below pre-pandemic levels, and that has continued. So our game plan in this environment is we're going to invest in our network, we're going to focus on upgrading and the mid-split.\nAll that activity is on track leading to 4.0, beginning the deployments and trialing activity starting at the end of the year. No change to our game plan, and we're going to segment the base, and we've consistently focused on the starting point, high-end broadband activity, and tiers. 1/3 of our customers are plus or 1 Gig, and we've launched our new 2 Gig service to 25% of our footprint, and overall 75% of our customers or for 100 Mb or more.\nSo we're going to continue to leverage mobile, we're going to press aggressively with mobile and even new broadband partners like NOW TV, which is a great streaming video tier that showcases Peacock, and the net of this is a stable base of 32 million residential broadband customers and while protecting RESI broadband ARPU growth. You saw us do that in Q2 at 4.5% ARPU growth. But in this environment where it's still competitive and lower activity, it's a period of flux, and in some quarters we may report customer losses. That being said, to your question, we believe over time we will return to subscriber growth, and certainly we're seeing more normalization.\nBack to school is going to happen in Q3, and most certainly there's some seasonal normalization. But over time, I'm confident that we will be able to balance this formula of ARPU focus and, over time, getting back to subscriber growth. Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave. Hey, good morning, Ben. So I think I just add a point. If you look back at the first half of the year, what Dave and his team have been doing and continue to do in terms of setting the broadband business, which is obviously extremely important to the future of the company, up for long-term success by continuing to improve our product. Add innovation around it, segment the base, extend the footprint, all the things that you want to see happen while protecting pricing are all outstanding work in a competitive moment in time.\nBut I think as you know, we here, and Dave and his team in particular are thinking, what are the implications for the long term as we think about how to compete in the short term? Going to your question on the NBC side on strikes, I'll just repeat what I said earlier, which is that we are committed to reaching a fair deal with the guild as soon as possible. Beyond that, you know, just say it's, you know, really for all involved in the industry broadly, a prolonged work stoppage and the longer it goes, the worse it'll be. It's obviously going to have a negative impact all around to your, you know, question about Free Cash Flow.\nNothing to quantify in the context of our company. I mean it's all manageable, but it will shift studio working capital out of, you know, the near term and into the future. So probably for 2023, a little bit of lower, lower working capital, higher Free Cash Flow and the flip side of that, in 2024. As you look at Peacock, I wouldn't point out anything in particular related to strikes and its effect, you know, in 2023 or second half of the year. Obviously, the longer a strike, the, the more that could have an effect as you look into 2024 and beyond and that would be for ourselves and others, obviously. So it's a level playing field.\nBut just to comment on Peacock in particular, in the second half, we've got a lot of strong content coming. So we've got NFL coming back, obviously. Then on top of that, we have an exclusive NFL wild card game. We're going to have Big Ten for the first time, which is fantastic. On Saturday nights, movie slates. We've got Super Mario Bros. coming to Peacock shortly. We've got Exorcist, Five Nights at Freddy's, as Jason pointed out, coming from Blumhouse, and then on TV side, some originals, including Continental, which is related to the John Wick franchise. So we feel very good about the strength of what we have coming in the second half of the year, content wise.\nAnd then beyond that on Peacock, I think there will be a continuation of the good work that we've done inside the company to convert Comcast subscribers over to a paying subscriber status, which, you know, we're not quite halfway through that as we, you know, only got started in June on that score. So over the remainder of the year, that will also be happening. So when you look at the doubling of Peacock subs year-over-year and, you know, I'm optimistic about what the second half of the year brings. Feel pretty good about Peacock.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Our next question today is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, two questions, if I could, regarding your wireless business. One, there's been some talk in the market, and there was some discussion on the Verizon call yesterday. Sort of calling, if not fully into question, at least kind of raising some eyebrows with respect to the perfect permanence of that contract. I'm just wondering if there is anything that you can say about the durability of that relationship and your confidence that that is in fact an irrevocable contract. And then second, you've obviously now started to subsidize handsets more frequently in line with the way the whole market really operates.\nI wonder if you could just talk about that a bit and talk about your views on customer lifetime value that you're seeing with new customer acquisitions given the handset subsidies and expected churn.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. This is Dave. So let me start with the wireless MVNO question. We have a great MVNO and really like our approach towards the business from day one and continue to feel that way and definitely think that cable is a material and really strong benefit to our partner, and so got a good relationship with Verizon, and so that continues. Really key is we have a perpetual access to all the services that we need from Verizon's network. So it's just straightforward, that's the way it is. Then let me go into the handset subsidy point. We go in and we go out in terms of different offers. So we've always consistently had promotions, and they come in different forms.\nCan be in the form of gift cards, can be outright promotions that are discounts, and in some cases a free device. But it's not every day. That's not part of our everyday game plan. We will go in and out with that, and we increasingly focus on higher end mobile tiers, and we have a great slate there between buy the Gig unlimited and Premium unlimited. So we stay very focused on the core service offering and been very strong in terms of the really consistent performance in terms of wireless growth. We really like the long runway ahead that we have, and you know, things that we're just getting going in small business and wireless.\nBut I think our core wireless pricing provides customers with the savings that help us compete against the telephone companies like between 30% and 50% savings versus the telcos.And so we got a strong position partnering mobile with broadband, got great Wi-Fi overlay, and a strong MVNO as I've said. So we like our capital-light approach, we like our core service offering approach, and it's been effective.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly, next question is coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Disney has said that they're looking for potentially a partner to help them transition ESPN to a more direct consumer model. You have a really big sports franchise as well. How are you thinking about further transitioning NBC Sports to a business that is mostly streaming? Is it something you think you would need a partner for? And maybe broadly speaking, do you think as sports businesses become more streaming centric, there's an opportunity or need for consolidation among those platforms? Thank you.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brett. It's Mike. So, you know, I've been asked about and read the speculation that in some, you know, way, we might be interested in swapping businesses as part of, you know, what's going on in the sports space. I would just say that that's very improbable given the, you know, as you could imagine, there's tremendous issues around tax, minority shareholders, structuring generally. So, I would put aside the idea that there's. Anything inorganic that is likely to happen around ESPN in particular, which is what we've been asked about. When I think about our own sports business, I think we've got one of the best portfolios in sports.\nSunday Night Football, Big Ten, EPL, NASCAR, WWE, Olympics next year, PGA. So, and we've got a very acclaimed group of people in terms of producing excellent content around those sports. So obviously it makes us a really strong partner to leagues and around the world, we're known for that. And I think we bring a lot to the table whenever there's a time. And that includes Sky Sports as well, obviously. So that brings us to the table with more than money when it comes time for discussions around how rights owners want to create value for their participants.\nAnd I think, you know, we are doing a very good job in my mind of continuing to do that in a way that has tremendous reach. Obviously, through NBC and the broadcast side, we can leverage our cable nets, as we've done, you know, through in various sporting events using our cable nets. But really importantly is Peacock. We looked at, you know, one of the great drivers of Peacock subscriber growth has been sports. I think it adds to the value of the Peacock subscription.\nThe fact that, you know, when we look at the value of rights that are streamed inside Peacock, where it is and where it goes, when you include the value of the Olympics next year, it is very substantial and would alone represent a really good deal for the consumer, just sports within Peacock. I think that's how we see our evolution. We're in sports. We're going to continue to be in sports. That's the game.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brett. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nHi, guys. Thank you. Lots to talk about. One follow up on Brett: Do you think that you have the right sports rights mix, or could you stretch your lead and Peacock's lead by taking more over time? And then, second, could you dig into the strong Hollywood and the weaker Orlando numbers? It looks like Orlando, just in general, is a little bit softer year-over-year. But we had been thinking you had been taking share. Do you agree with that? And how do you see that going forward? Thanks very much.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSo sports rights, going back to that last question, for all the reasons I said, and I'll keep it shorter this time, you know, we should. We're always looking to see if there's ways to add more value to our business and likewise work with partners. So obviously NBA is coming up. That's a fantastic property. We don't necessarily need it given the portfolio we have, but given its strength and our historical involvement in the sport. Something I'd like to see us take a look at as a for instance. But we'll see where that goes. And then on theme parks, we have, you know, I think one of the best quarters we've seen tremendous momentum in the overall portfolio.\nFeel very, very good about the parks business overall. Hollywood was record on the back of Nintendo opening up. Japan doing well and a record as well there for Q2 and Beijing highest level of profitability. In Orlando, you know, it really compares very well to pre-pandemic. We're obviously down on attendance, which was kind of unprecedented in the back of coming off COVID. So not surprised by that softening. That said, we're at levels of attendance and per caps being better. So that, you know, overall we feel good about what we're seeing in Orlando, we have had with a stronger dollar.\nYou still are seeing softness of international attendance, which continues to be about 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to sort of continue. And on the domestic side, it's just been a rebalancing with cruise lines back and people. The flip side of the dollar, doing some international travel. It's the dynamics that you see in Orlando. Feel really good about what's going on there. And Brian, you know, going to jump in here.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nJust want to add that, you know. Really bullish on the parks. It's one of the six areas, Jason mentioned that we feel are the growth driver of the company in the years ahead. We were just down in Orlando recently looking at Epic Universe progress, and it's spectacular what's coming in 2025. We have the two parks, the smaller parks in Las Vegas and outside Dallas. We're looking for growth in this area. We're pretty excited about the results that. Jason and Mike have talked about. I just draw your attention that the opportunity in Orlando with Epic is pretty massive, we believe.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Phil.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nThanks guys.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, BofA Securities\n\nThanks. I have one maybe longer term and one near term. First, on content, you just announced a restructuring in your content area. With the current strike, which is kind of reminiscent of the pandemic where all production is shut down, at least in the US it seems like an opportune time to rethink your entire content strategy. Are you thinking differently at all about how you produce, what you produce, what your costs are? You know, just anything you can say about how NBCU may change its approach to content in coming years? And then on advertising, the upfront, I guess, is still dragging on. Can you talk about what you're seeing?\nWhere there's strength and weakness and where the dollars are being allocated to what platform platforms? And I think that Jason just said that Q3 advertising will be similar to Q2.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nOkay. So in terms of content, I'm really pleased with Jessica, with the. Elevation of a couple of my partners at NBC, one of them being Donna Langley, who's one of the most respected people in Hollywood, along with, we've got great leader Pearlena Igbokwe, who runs our TV studios. So I think giving them. A sort of content vertical that's going to work closely with Mark Lazarus on the TV side and platform side, and Cesar Conde on News and Telemundo, I think is going to really take advantage of, you know, the company that we have. We're going to obviously be very much focused on, on creating great content.\nBut we already do create great content when you look at the movie slates we've had and the TV that we produce for ourselves and others. And I think that strategy is going to continue. We're not going to be creating content exclusively for ourselves, but I think it's a great advantage for our studios to actually have platforms that can take a substantial amount, though not all, of the content that we can create, which puts us in a great position to work with all sorts of talent. Creators in Hollywood and elsewhere can come work with our great leadership in our studios, and we help bring their ideas to life in terms of cost, strategy, and so forth.\nWe will work in the context of the industry and the buyers and what they're looking for and be responsive to that. I feel very, very good about the way our studio businesses are set up in terms of advertising. The ad market softened versus last year. It stabilized as it came into this year and has stayed stable. I think that would be on the back of just. Uncertainty about economic outlook looking forward. I think Jason's comments are we don't see that condition changing as we're looking into the Q3 and second half of the year. As you know, I think we feel good about our upfronts.\nYou know, despite those headwinds, our total cash and pricing levels were roughly in line with last year and really strong related to Peacock in particular. But a lot of that comes from the strength of our portfolio, as I've kind of mentioned earlier, where we see strength around big tents under football, Peacock, one platform, and the like, all things that are helping us out quite a bit.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steven Cahill from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahill\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. Just two on the connectivity side of the business. Maybe first on the broadband ARPU, really strong at 4.5%. I was wondering if you could help us unpack that a little bit. Maybe what in there is price increase? How much do you think you're getting from customers up tiering to faster speeds? And maybe what might be coming from cord cutting as some of your Double Play video subs go to Single Play, Internet, or Internet plus mobile bundles? And then on the international side, where revenue growth is really strong, can you just help us think through what kind of margin contribution you get on international? You know, you talked about more handsets in the quarter.\nI'm guessing those are a little lower margin, as is some of the UK connectivity stuff. But as we just think about that as a growth driver, how should we think about the margin or EBITDA contribution from international? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nGot it. So let me start with ARPU, and you hit on a couple of the key points. First off, pretty strong performance in the quarter. As we've said, we've seen 4.5%, and there are multiple drivers. There was a little bit more rate that we took early on, not wildly different, but a little bit more that we did in the beginning of the year. I think a critical one for us is tier mix, and we have 1/3 of our base that's a Gigabit Plus. And that 75%, 400 Mb or higher, that definitely impacts. The overall ARPU. I think one that maybe not as understood as much as maybe as it should be, but we have a wonderful product called xFi Complete. 25% of our base has that.\nAnd let me take one second to describe what's in it. It's a gateway. It's a great gateway that's included in the tier with a path to upgrading the gateway over time. You have an opportunity to do that. Advanced security is included in that, unlimited is included in that. And then a coverage plan making sure your whole house is covered. So xFi Complete is a great tier, good value to customers, 25% of the base. And then there's the bundle discount that you mentioned. When customers go to HSD only, you lose the bundle discount, and so all of those things factor in. So I think it's a positive that there are multiple drivers that are helping.\nThe thing, Steven, that starts with is just where the market's going, and I mentioned that before, and you have this very stable group of customers that are just using more, and over time that continues to trend up, and we have this balance of a stable base and healthy ARPU growth on international connectivity and the margin side. So it's. This is a great growth area for us. You look at that from a revenue perspective, just starting with that because that impacts margin.\nThe revenue increased 26% this quarter, as Jason said in the call. 2/3 of that revenue comes from broadband, which continues to grow at mid-teens level and was driven by higher-level customers and ARPU accretion compared to a year ago. Remaining 1/3 is wireless, which tends to have more variable growth quarter-to-quarter due to handsets. You know, this is a solid quarter growth rate, and it will impact margins. But you know, normalizing for the mobile side of things, revenue growth, I think maybe the right level to focus on is more closer to the 20% level for international connectivity.\nSo I think this is a strong part of the portfolio and a definite contributor towards, as Jason has said, one of the main pillars of, you know, not only just domestic broadband and mobile but also the international broadband and mobile. Jason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, and I think Steven, you know, important for us as we came into this year with the resegmentation and how we, you know, sort of presented out to the world this was an important category. So international connectivity as we think about Sky and taking the brand name and reputation that they've sort of earned in video and taking that into other products like broadband and wireless the way they have, you know, this quarter, $1 billion in revenue coming from connectivity internationally. So you know, kudos to the team and I think, you know, important that we've been able to highlight that to the Street.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks guys. Maybe a couple questions on profitability. I think maybe for Jason first, really impressive performance on the cable side. 240 basis points, 47%. I mean, how's the visibility into further margin expansion from here, especially given, you know, you've got a couple mix shift issues. Obviously more broadband and less video, but also more wireless. So anything you could tell us about the sort of outlook there, and then on the Peacock side, doing better in terms of losses. There is $3 billion losses for this year, still the right number for Peacock. And anything you'd say about the sort of path to profitability beyond 2023 would be great. Thanks.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, John. Good question. So, on mix and margins in the connectivity business, I think we've had a fairly consistent track record. If you look at the last several years of margin expansion, you know, if you look at the core sort of legacy cable business, as we mentioned this quarter, record margin over 47%. And the factors that have contributed to that, you know, historically are in place as we look forward. You know, I think Mike's comments up front about, you know, being able to grow revenue, being able to grow margins, you know, that's a key part of it.\nSo to your question specifically on connectivity, there is a mix shift going on when we talk about sort of the six key growth drivers across the company. Three are sort of core connectivity growth drivers, whether it's broadband, residential, broadband, business services, or wireless. This is an accretive mix shift for us as we think about the way the categories are sort of shifting and what's growing versus what's not growing. So I would look for more of the same. I think, you know, also importantly for the team, for the second consecutive quarter, every expense line in connectivity and platforms was down year-over-year, except for direct product costs.\nAnd those are the costs that directly support the connectivity and platforms. Revenue growth in the categories we talked about. So outlook for more of the same and continued margin expansion out of the business. I think on Peacock, you're right. We came into the year, gave guidance for roughly $3 billion in losses. No change to that. As you see, we're pacing to that over the first couple quarters. We've got a lot of incremental content as we think of the back half of the year, as Mike said. So no change to that guidance.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\n\nVijay Jayant\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI",
    "content2": "Good morning. So I think Jason talked about, you know, future expansion of the footprint being a high priority, and the bid dollars by state have been sort of allocated. Can you just talk about is that really going to be a big opportunity in terms of, you know, participating in that and, you know, driving that footprint? Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey there, this is Dave. Let me jump into that. So, you know, we operate in 39 states where there. Expected BEAD subsidy money. We're actively engaged both at the federal and state government levels. So you know, as the framework rules of BEAD participation are being developed, you know, we're actively, you know, looking at it and working I think in a good way at all levels. So assuming satisfactory outcomes on the framework rules, we're going to be full participants in bidding where it is consistent with our business goals. But it's too early in the process for us to, you know, comment on where we'll bid or you know, potential win rate.\nBut we're, you know, we're active right now building out edge outs as Jason's talked about. We're going to build out, you know, even, you know, before any BEAD activity. The BEAD activity by the way is really going to be more rules will come out and be clarified. This is a 2025, 2026 kind of an impact once it clears up. But in the meantime, we're actively reaching out and looking at opportunities where it's a profitable return and aggressively pursuing it. So, a million homes passed we expect to build this year alone. So, we're going to be aggressive in the meantime. But you know, considering we'll stay close to it and assuming a satisfactory outcome, we will be a participant.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay. Operator, we'll take our last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks guys. Just to drill into broadband in a little bit more detail, the shift from Q1 to Q2 was quite different from what it has been historically in terms of broadband net adds. I'm wondering if you can give us just a little bit more color on how much of that was muted seasonality versus some of the initiatives that you guys have been pushing on the competitive front with low-end broadband offer and the wireless bundles. And in that context you mentioned that wireless is starting to have a bigger pull-through impact on your broadband subs or that they're more new-to-Comcast subs.\nTaking wireless, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more context around that and then sorry to pile on but one last one on wireless for Jason. When we look at Verizon's wholesale revenue, it seems to have flattened over the course of the last three quarters, which suggests that maybe you're getting some gross margin expansion in the wireless business. I'm wondering if that's accurate. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey there. So this is Dave. Let me start on the broadband part and a little bit on wireless. So as we saw, the base is stable 32 million and this is sequentially and year-over-year. For this quarter, we also flagged, you know, we talked about this last quarter. We expected more normal seasonal activity so that net adds would be lower than Q1. But we also expected a more muted step down in net adds from Q1 to Q2. This is a combination of lower overall move activity, the overall macro issues that we've experienced over the past year in the market. At the same time, you know, we did, as you brought up, we go in and out in terms of offers.\nWe had some offers really targeted in the multiple segments that we served, more in the lower end, and we had, you know, some traction on some of that. So that did help. And so we'll continue to be opportunistic throughout the year. As I mentioned before to your point on wireless, we absolutely aggressively package mobile with broadband. And this is for new and existing customers. So mobile is a great extension of the relationship in a really profitable way to existing customers that HSD only. So it's one of the key things that we do, and I think over time we're going to continue to stay focused on that.\nI think it's as much of an opportunity to grow the mobile business and really help broadband, as going to the base as well as attracting new customers. So it's a double win from our perspective. Jason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, just. Jonathan, thanks for the question. On wireless. Can't speak to Verizon and their revenue trajectory. I know they've got a few different things in the wholesale revenue category, you know, beyond just cable. But I can speak to obviously the economics of our business. We're happy with it. We think it's good business for Verizon. That's sort of what they said yesterday as they think about, you know, traffic and ways to fill up their network. But for us specifically, we've got a revenue stream coming in from customers. We have a, you know, wholesale deal with Verizon to accommodate that traffic where there's outflows.\nBut then we're also trying to offload as much traffic as we can on our own network. We've got a fairly efficient acquisition vehicle in that, you know, a lot of this is just marketed to our own broadband subscribers. So in terms of acquisition costs, I think we're fairly efficient in the market and then all the way down sort of, you know, closer to cash flow. This is a capital light model which we like. So I'll leave it there.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Thank you everyone for joining us on our Q2 call.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast Q2 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome to our Q2 2023 Earnings Call. You'll first hear from Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong, then Brian Roberts and Dave Watson will join us and be available for Q&A. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer. This conference call may include forward looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our Q2 results, which again demonstrate that our focused efforts to invest and innovate in businesses that offer significant revenue growth while we carefully manage the commoditized areas with structurally lower growth is paying off. Total revenue grew 2%, and the six growth priority areas we have outlined, residential broadband, wireless business services, theme parks, streaming, and premium content creation in our Studios, grew nearly 10% year-over-year and now represent 55% of total revenue.\nThis revenue growth combined with careful management of margins across all businesses generated mid-single-digit EBITDA growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. Looking farther into the future, we expect to continue to drive significant growth in these areas and to continue to identify and invest in organic growth opportunities across our strong portfolio of businesses.\nWe are also very clear-eyed about the challenges that we and our competitors face in other business lines and have established thoughtful plans which will enable these businesses to continue to meaningfully contribute both financially and strategically. Importantly, the net effect of this approach is a path to sustained future revenue growth for the company in total, driving strong earnings and Free Cash Flow growth for what I expect to be many years to come.\nSignificantly, we have by far the strongest balance sheet among our core competitors, which allows us to continue to invest for growth while returning substantial capital to shareholders through both dividends and buybacks, which will drive excellent Free Cash Flow and earnings per share growth.\nNow let me call out a few highlights from the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, we generated over $10 billion in quarterly EBITDA, and while the diversification of our businesses means there were several significant contributors, I would highlight three that stand out to me in the quarter and reflect the consistency of our investments and the resulting durability of our growth profile. The first is broadband ARPU growth of 4.5%. Stepping back, I am confident we have a winning hand in convergence. We're the largest broadband provider with a high quality ubiquitous network and the most cost efficient upgrade path to higher speeds.\nIn addition, we can compete effectively in wireless with a capital light approach and a very strong value proposition for our customers. We also have a long history of consistently surrounding our products with industry-leading features and capabilities ranging from the coverage and control aspects of our Wi-Fi experience to content aggregation through our X1 and Flex platforms, which is how we have been able to achieve near-record-low levels of churn and grow ARPU consistently quarter-after-quarter.\nThis Q2's 4.5% growth was no exception and is a testament to our ability to appropriately balance rate and volume to effectively segment the market and surround our broadband product with industry-leading products and capabilities. The broadband market remains highly competitive, but we have and will continue to invest to sustain our position as a market leader. Second is our Parks, which continues to be such a great story for us. Our teams have consistently introduced new and innovative attractions leveraging both our owned or licensed IP.\nWe opened Super Nintendo World at both Universal Hollywood in Japan, which helped drive the record results in the quarter. Later this summer, we will be opening a new Minion Land in Orlando, and we look forward to Donkey Kong in Japan next year as well as starting the previously announced kids theme park in Texas and the Halloween horror experience in Las Vegas. And I couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe in Orlando in 2025. Third is the strength of our film studios and, in particular, our animation business. Super Mario Bros. crossed over $1.3 billion in worldwide box office to date, making it the second highest grossing animated film ever.\nThis is another incredible achievement by Illumination and Chris Meledandri. We also invest in successful franchises like Fast, highlighted by the successful launch of the latest installment with Fast 10 during the quarter. Of course we just released Oppenheimer, which grossed about $180 million this past weekend to tremendous acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike. Oppenheimer is such a powerful and impactful movie and we at Comcast couldn't be more proud to work with Christopher Nolan to bring such an important movie to audiences globally.\nWe have the very best roster of creative partners and these innovative filmmakers enable us to invest in a strategic, strategic slate which is one of the keys to our continued box office success where we remain number two in box office year to date. All of these results and accomplishments, from broadband differentiation to studio leadership to our park success, are a function of our focused leadership team, commitment to innovation, strong balance sheet, and disciplined approach to capital allocation.\nAs I look at our company, I am extremely bullish on the durability of growth drivers we've invested in so consistently, and in our continued ability to invest and deliver through a variety of businesses and economic cycles. This was also my Q1 with direct responsibility for NBCUniversal. As I observed in a note announcing some organizational changes a few weeks ago, NBCU is a very special place with tremendous opportunities ahead.\nI could not be more impressed with the depth of talent and particularly with our leadership team, and I am very confident that the new streamlined organization we have just put in place and which has been very well received will help us move even faster and make even better decisions. As you know, NBCU operates a diverse array of businesses, each with leading market positions. In addition to film and parks which I referenced earlier, we have the number one TV portfolio by total audience and our TV studio is award-winning and prolific.\nWe're the number one most watched news organization in the US and sports continues to be a huge driver with the NFL, NASCAR, Golf, Premier League, the World Cup on Telemundo, including the Women's World Cup going on right now, Big Ten starting this fall, and the Paris Olympics coming up next year. I am also confident that we have the right strategy for the future. We produce premium content through our studios, distribute it through our TV networks, Peacock, and third parties, and further monetize this content with our theme parks and consumer products in streaming.\nWe launched Peacock as an ad-supported model that is an extension of our existing business. We set out a plan which we have adapted as needed, and Peacock is strong and growing. We gained 2 million paid subscribers in Q2, going from 22 million to 24 million paid subscribers. This growth was largely driven by conversion of Comcast subs to paying relationships which started in June, and we're very pleased with the results so far.\nWithout a doubt, consumer trends such as cord cutting, and new competitors, particularly from the technology sector, present challenges for us, and we are facing an uncertain macro environment which continues to pressure linear advertising. But I firmly believe that we have the business strategy, management depth, and financial strength to emerge as long-term winners and value creators as the landscape evolves at NBCUniversal and across the company. Another challenge in the near term are the writers and actors strikes. We remain committed to reaching a fair deal as soon as possible so we can get back to doing what we do best, which is making great content together.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Mike and good morning everyone. We had a really strong Q2, and to take you through it, I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Revenue increased 2% to $30.5 billion while adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $10.2 billion, a record level driven by continued operating leverage at our high margin connectivity and platforms business as well as strong growth at studios and theme parks. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $1.13 and generated $3.4 billion of Free Cash Flow while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders.\nOur healthy level of Free Cash Flow in the quarter includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our businesses in six key growth areas. Our connectivity businesses including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity, theme parks, streaming, and premium content in our studios. Taken together, these areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter and grew nearly 10% year-over-year, consistent with the Q1. Now let's turn to our individual business results starting on slide five with connectivity and platforms. As I get into these results, I'll refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis.\nRevenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Our core connectivity businesses domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity increased 7% to over $10 billion in revenue, while video advertising and other revenue declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Our strategy continues to incorporate a strong focus on investing in and driving growth in high margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management.\nThis resulted in 170 basis points of margin expansion for connectivity and platforms in Q2, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 240 basis points, reaching a record high of 47.3%. Diving deeper into the details first, I'll unpack connectivity revenue growth. Residential connectivity revenue grew by 8% reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 20% growth in wireless, and 26% growth in international, while revenue for business services connectivity grew 4%. Domestic broadband continued to be led by very strong ARPU growth, which increased 4.5% for the second consecutive quarter.\nAs we have said before, our goal is to protect ARPU by retaining the appropriate balance between rate and volume and to serve our customers constant demand for more from our network. We continue to see the use cases for better and faster internet increase. Demand for higher speeds is increasing as is average network consumption, and our customers are hanging more devices off our network in their homes. The average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 GB and continues to grow. In fact, this is nearly 70% more than the average usage from the comparable quarter in 2019 pre-pandemic.\nAdditionally, nearly 3/4 of our broadband customers are now on speed plans of 400 Mbps and above. That's up from less than 50% last year and less than 20% in 2020. We plan for our network and product capabilities to stay far ahead of demand so that we maintain our position as a market leader delivering the best broadband possible. To that end, our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is progressing well. We're more than halfway through the year and have implemented our mid-split technology to 25% of our footprint and are on target to complete 1/3 of this build by year-end with the first commercial launch of DOCSIS 4.0 in just a few short months.\nWe're also hard at work when it comes to expanding our footprint. We've grown our homes and businesses passed by 1.5% year-over-year to 61.8 million, and we are on pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses passed for 2023, with future footprint expansion remaining a high priority. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was due to higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up 1.4 million or 30% year-over-year to 6 million in total, including the 316,000 lines we just added in the quarter. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 300,000 line additions.\nWe continued testing some new converged offers in the quarter and were encouraged by an increasing mix of new customers to Comcast, and we'll continue to experiment with different offers over time. With just 10% of our domestic residential broadband customers taking our mobile offering, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue grew to $1 billion, a record high, and demonstrates the strength of the Sky brand and the ability to leverage a leadership position in video and extend that to connectivity with significant success.\nBroadband, which accounts for 2/3 of international connectivity revenue, continued to grow at a mid-teens level benefiting from both an increase in customers and ARPU compared to a year ago. The remainder is wireless revenue which tends to have more variable growth due to handsets which contributed to the higher growth rate this quarter. Finally, on business services, connectivity revenue increased 4% reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market and a slight deceleration in growth from small business where we were seeing a bit of macroeconomic pressure.\nThe strong revenue growth overall in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video due to customer losses since last year as well as declines in other revenue reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice, and finally in advertising which was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets and the macro environment. Connectivity and platforms total EBITDA increased 4% to $8.3 billion and as I mentioned a moment ago, an adjusted margin that expanded 170 basis points. This is driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses coupled with very strong expense management.\nIn fact, every line of expense was down year-over-year except direct product costs, which are success based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. Further, unpacking our connectivity and platforms EBITDA results between residential and business, residential EBITDA grew 4% with margin improving 180 basis points to reach 38.9%, again highlighting our favorable mix shift while business EBITDA grew 5% with margin improving 40 basis points to reach 57.7%. Now let's turn to content and experiences on slide six.\nContent and experiences revenue increased 4% to $10.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 7.5% to $2.2 billion driven by record results at parks and strong growth at studios fueled by the success of Super Mario Bros. Taking a closer look at the results, our media segment combines our TV networks and Peacock, matching our holistic approach to managing these businesses as viewership shifts to streaming. Our dual revenue strategy at Peacock, where we're growing advertising and distribution revenue, is offsetting declines in linear revenue.\nAt the same time, we are managing costs at our linear networks and reallocating some of these resources to Peacock with the goal of maximizing profitability over the long term across our media portfolio. You see that in our media results this quarter with stable revenue as strong growth in Peacock offset the performance at our linear networks. Media EBITDA decreased 18%, which included a $651 million EBITDA loss at Peacock.\nTo get a little further into the details, domestic advertising declined 5%, with underlying trends consistent to prior quarters, reflecting continued softness in the overall market, partially offset by strong growth in advertising at Peacock, which increased over 75% driven by strong demand. We expect these overall results in advertising to continue in Q3. Domestic distribution increased 2% driven by Peacock distribution revenue growth of nearly 70%. Peacock paid subscribers landed at 24 million compared to 13 million a year ago and 22 million at the end of Q1.\nAs Mike mentioned, in June we began an effort to transition Comcast bundled subscribers who receive Peacock for free to a paid relationship. We've made some nice progress to date as the conversion activity drove Peacock's Q2 subscriber growth, and we're bullish on further increasing our Peacock subscriber base through the balance of 2023, driven by both our continued conversion efforts as well as strong programming in second half 2023.\nSome highlights include a strong lineup of movies exclusively on Peacock in our Pay-One window, including Super Mario Bros. coming 3 August 2023 a day-and-date movie Blumhouse Five Nights at Freddy's coming at the end of October, and continued benefits from our next-day broadcast and Bravo content, along with a strong sports lineup including Sunday Night Football and, for the first time, Big Ten. Turning to studios, we had a great quarter driven by our film business, including the latest installment of the Fast franchise and the tremendous success of Super Mario Bros.\nWhile theatrical revenue growth was offset by lower content licensing at our television studios due to the timing of when we deliver content. The momentum in our film business led by the success of Mario fueled nearly $260 million in year-over-year growth in studio EBITDA. At theme parks revenue increased 22% and EBITDA increased 32% to $833 million, a record level. Our park in Hollywood continued its momentum from opening Super Nintendo World last quarter. The positive consumer reaction drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarterly EBITDA in its history.\nOur international parks are both experiencing nice rebounds post-COVID. Our park in Osaka delivered a record level of EBITDA for a Q2 as it continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World, and our park in Beijing enjoyed its most profitable quarter to date, resulting in strong improvement compared to last year when the park was largely closed due to COVID. In Orlando, our comparisons were impacted by unprecedented levels of visitation last year, but underlying momentum remains healthy as attendance was relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels, while revenue was substantially ahead of 2019 levels.\nI'll now wrap up with Free Cash Flow and capital allocation on slide seven. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.4 billion in Free Cash Flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 20% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx, which was consistent with the outlook that we provided on our last quarter call. At connectivity and platforms, CapEx increased 11% with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.4%, primarily driven by investments to accelerate our growth in homes passed as well as transition our US network to DOCSIS 4.0 content and experiences.\nCapEx increased by $344 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. Turning to return of capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the Q2 of $3.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.4x in line with our target leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Brian for a few words before we turn the call back to Marci.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. I'm really pleased with our team and this outstanding performance for the first half of the year. It was a terrific quarter on all the great metrics you've just articulated. So, I'd like to just zoom out a bit and probably what's most exciting is the hopefully recurring and sustainable model that we're able to leverage our faster growing businesses, which you laid out, to generate revenue growth for the entire company. And then we convert that all the way to Free Cash Flow Per Share. That accelerates with the strength of our company and our balance sheet. I really couldn't be more proud of the team. Excited about the future. Marci, let's turn it over to you for Q&A.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator. Let's open up the call, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have a question, please press star and then the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star and the number two. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers once again. If there are any questions, please press star and the number one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning. Question on broadband and then one on NBC. Maybe for Mike and Dave. When you think about the converged offers you have in the market, I know you've been testing more the investments in the network. Those tailwinds against sort of the headwinds around competition, housing, fixed wireless. When you put that all together, how are you feeling about the ability for the company to return to consistent broadband customer growth? Particularly when you look into maybe the seasonally stronger back half or into next year. Then Mike, you mentioned the strikes. There's a lot of different ways that those could impact your business depending on how long it lasts.\nBut I'm particularly interested in Free Cash Flow for the company and also Peacock. There's a lot of expectations around Peacock. Profitability improving or losses coming down, and continued growth. When you put the strike into context for us, how should we be thinking about the impact? Should this last longer than expected? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey Ben, this is Dave. Let me start with broadband and hand it over to Mike. I think talking about this environment, you've got to start where the market is and where the customer is going. The customers continue to be highly engaged in multiple broadband applications. Streaming, gaming, all trending up. You look at the other thing that is happening, just an increasing number of simultaneous device usage that's happening in peak moments. Now we have over a billion connected devices, Wi-Fi-connected devices to our network. So from an overall perspective, that's just very encouraging. You look at the results.\nNon-video broadband customers are doing more than 700 GB per month. You take one key area, one major streaming part of the business and that's sports. It starts with just making it really easy to find the sporting event. So, great voice search that we have on our platform, multiple ways to consume sports and linear DVR streaming, all seamlessly connected. And then, of course, comes when big sports moments happen. You want reliability, fast speeds, great coverage, and capacity. And you look at just what happened: Thursday Night Football, Messi, and MLS. Peacock has a fantastic sports slate that will be streamed and consumed that way.\nSo, you need great broadband to be able to back all of that up. And so, I think that's a great driver over time. But in this environment, we are seeing continued lower move activity. Competition is still increased, and fixed wireless you brought out; they're still pressing. However, we are seeing some rational promotional activity. It's early, no changes to any trending. But when you see that in the competitive environment that is encouraging, both voluntary and nonpaid churn remain below pre-pandemic levels. And that has continued. So our game plan in this environment is we're going to invest in our network, we're going to focus on upgrading and the mid-split.\nAll that activity is on track, leading to 4.0, beginning the deployments and trialing activity starting at the end of the year. No change to our game plan, and we're going to segment the base, and we've consistently focused on the starting point high-end broadband activity and tiers. 1/3 of our customers are plus or 1 Gig, and we've launched our new 2 Gig service to 25% of our footprint, and overall 75% of our customers or for 100 Mb or more. So we're going to continue to leverage mobile.\nWe're going to press aggressively with mobile and even new broadband partners like NOW TV, which is a great streaming video tier that showcases Peacock, and the net of this is a stable base of 32 million residential broadband customers while protecting RESI broadband ARPU growth. You saw us do that in Q2 at 4.5% ARPU growth, but in this environment where it's still competitive and lower activity, it's a period of flux, and in some quarters we may report customer losses. That being said to your question, we believe over time we will return to subscriber growth, and certainly we're seeing more normalization.\nBack to school is going to happen in Q3, and most certainly there's some seasonal normalization. Over time I'm confident that we will be able to balance this formula of ARPU focus and over time getting back to subscriber growth. Mike.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave. Good morning, Ben. So, I think I just add a point. If you look back at the first half of the year, what Dave and his team have been doing and continue to do in terms of setting the broadband business, which is obviously extremely important to the future of the company, up for long-term success by continuing to improve our product. Add innovation around it, segment the base, expansion, extend the footprint, all the things that you want to see happen while protecting pricing are all outstanding work in a competitive moment in time.\nBut I think as you know, we here, and Dave and his team in particular are thinking what are the implications for the long term as we think about how to compete in the short term? Going to your question on the NBC side on strikes, I'll just repeat what I said earlier, which is that we are committed to reaching a fair deal with the guilds as soon as possible. Beyond that, you know, just say it's, you know, really for all involved in the industry broadly a prolonged work stoppage, and the longer it goes, the worse it will be. It's obviously going to have a negative impact all around. To your, you know, question about Free Cash Flow. Nothing to quantify in the context of our company.\nI mean, it's all manageable, but it will shift studio working capital out of, you know, the near term and into the future. So probably for 2023, a little bit of lower, lower working capital, higher Free Cash Flow. And the flip side of that, in 2024, as you look at Peacock, I wouldn't point out anything in particular related to strikes and its effect, you know, in 2023 or second half of year. The year, obviously, the longer the strike, the more that could have an effect as you look into 2024 and beyond. And that would be for ourselves and others, obviously. So it's a level playing field.\nBut just to comment on Peacock in particular, in the second half, we've got a lot of strong content coming, so we've got NFL coming back, obviously. Then on top of that, we have an exclusive NFL wild card game. We're going to have Big Ten for the first time, which is fantastic. On Saturday nights in movie slates, we've got Super Mario Bros. coming to Peacock shortly. We've got Exorcist, Five Nights at Freddy's, as Jason pointed out, coming from Blumhouse, and then on TV side, some originals, including Continental, which is related to the John Wick franchise. So we feel very good about the strength of what we have coming in the second half of the year, content-wise.\nAnd then beyond that on Peacock, I think there will be a continuation of the good work that we've done inside the company to convert Comcast subscribers over to a paying subscriber status, which, you know, we're not quite halfway through that as we, you know, only got started in June on that score. So over the remainder of the year that will also be happening. So when you look at the doubling of people, Peacock subs year-over-year and, you know, I'm optimistic about what the second half of the year brings. Feel pretty good about Peacock.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much,\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, two questions, if I could, regarding your wireless business. One, there's been some talk in the market, and there was some discussion on the Verizon call yesterday, sort of calling, if not fully into question, at least kind of raising some eyebrows with respect to the permanence of that contract. I'm just wondering if there is anything that you can say about the durability of that relationship and your confidence that that is in fact an irrevocable contract. And then second, you've obviously now started to subsidize handsets more frequently in line with the way the whole market really operates.\nI wonder if you could just talk about that a bit and talk about your views on customer lifetime value that you're seeing with new customer acquisitions given the handset subsidies and expected churn.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. This is Dave. So let me start with the wireless MVNO question. We have a great MVNO and really like our approach towards the business from day one and continue to feel that way and definitely think that cable is a material and really strong benefit to our partner and so have a good relationship with Verizon. And so that continues. Really key is we have a perpetual access to all the services that we need from Verizon's network. So it's just straightforward. That's the way it is. So let me start with, then let me go into the handset subsidy point. We go in and we go out in terms of different offers.\nSo we've always consistently had promotions and they come in different forms. Can be in the form of gift cards, can be outright promotions that are discounts, and in some cases a free device. But it's not every day. That's not part of our everyday game plan. We will go in and out with that, and we increasingly focus on higher-end mobile tiers, and we have a great slate there between buy the Gig unlimited and Premium unlimited. So we stay very focused on the core service offering, and then very strong in terms of the really consistent performance in terms of wireless growth.\nWe really like the long runway ahead that we have and things that we're just getting going in small business and wireless. But I think our core wireless pricing provides customers with the savings that help us compete against the telephone companies, like between 30% and 50% savings versus the telcos. And so we got a strong position partnering mobile with broadband. Got great Wi-Fi overlay and a strong MVNO, as I've said. So we like our capital light approach, we like our core service offering approach, and it's been effective.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly next question is coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. Disney has said that they're looking for potentially a partner to help them transition ESPN to a more direct consumer model. You have a really big sports franchise as well. How are you thinking about further transitioning NBC Sports to a business that is mostly streaming? Is it something you think you would need a partner for, and maybe broadly speaking, do you think as sports businesses become more streaming centric, there's an opportunity or need for consolidation among those platforms? Thank you.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brett. It's Mike. So, you know, I've been asked about and read the speculation that in some way we might be interested in swapping businesses as part of what's going on in the sports space. And I would just say that that's very improbable given the, as you could imagine, there's tremendous issues around tax, minority shareholders, structuring generally. So I would put aside the idea that there's. Anything inorganic that is likely to happen around ESPN in particular, which is what we've been asked about. When I think about our own sports business, I think we've got one of the best portfolios in sports. Sunday football, Big Ten, EPL, NASCAR, WWE, Olympics next year, PGA.\nSo, and we've got, you know, a very acclaimed group of people in terms of producing excellent, excellent, you know, content around those sports. So obviously it makes us a really strong partner to leagues, and around the world we're known for that. And I think we bring a lot to the table whenever there's a time. And that includes Sky Sports as well, obviously. So that brings us to the table with more than money when it comes time for discussions around how rights owners want to create value for their participants.\nI think, you know, we are doing a very good job in my mind of continuing to do that in a way that has provided tremendous reach, obviously through NBC and the broadcast side. We can leverage our cable nets as we've done, you know, through, in various sporting events using our cable nets. But really importantly is Peacock. And we look at, you know, one of the great drivers of Peacock subscriber growth has been sports. And I think it adds to the value of the Peacock subscription.\nThe fact that, you know, when we look at the value of rights that are streamed inside Peacock, where it is and where it goes, when you include the value of Olympics next year, it is very substantial and would alone represent a really good deal for the consumer, just sports within Peacock. So I think that's how we see our evolution. We're in sports, we're going to continue to be in sports. And that's the game.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brett. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nHi guys. Thank you. Lots to talk about. One follow-up on Brett: Do you think that you have the right sports rights mix, or could you stretch your lead and Peacock's lead by taking more over time? And then second, can you dig into the strong Hollywood and the weaker Orlando numbers? It looks like Orlando just in general is a little bit softer year-over-year. But we think you had been taking share. Do you agree with that, and how do you see that going forward? Thanks very much.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSo sports rights, going back to that last question, for all the reasons I said and I'll keep it shorter this time, you know we should. We're always looking to see if there's ways to add more value to our business and likewise work with partners. So obviously NBA is coming up. That's a fantastic property. We don't necessarily need it given the portfolio we have, but given its strength and our historical involvement in the sport. Something I'd like to see us take a look at as a for instance. But we'll see where that goes. Then on theme parks we have, you know, I think one of the best quarters we've seen. Tremendous momentum in the overall portfolio.\nWe feel very, very good about the parks business overall. Hollywood was a record on the back of Nintendo opening up. Japan doing well and a record as well there for a Q2. And Beijing highest, highest level of profitability in Orlando. It really compares very well to pre-pandemic. We're obviously down on attendance which was kind of unprecedented in the back of coming off COVID. So not surprised by that softening. That said, we're at levels of attendance and per caps being better. So that, you know, overall we feel good about what we're seeing in Orlando. We have had with a stronger dollar.\nYou still are seeing softness of international attendance which continues to be about 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to sort of continue. And on the domestic side, it's just been a rebalancing with cruise lines back and people the flip side of the dollar doing some international travel. It's the dynamics that you see in Orlando but feel really good about what's going on there. And Brian, you know, going to jump in here.\n\nBrian Roberts\n\nChairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nJust want to add that, you know. Really bullish on the parks. It's one of the six areas, Jason mentioned that we feel are the growth driver of the company in the years ahead. We were just down in Orlando recently, looking at Epic Universe progress, and it's spectacular what's coming in 2025. We have the two parks, the smaller parks in Vegas, and outside Dallas. We're looking for growth in this area. We're pretty excited about the results that. Jason and Mike have talked about. I just draw your attention that the opportunity in Orlando with Epic is pretty massive, we believe.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Phil.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nThanks guys.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, BofA Securities\n\nThanks. I have one maybe longer term and one near term. First, on content, you just announced a restructuring in your content area. And with the current strike, which is kind of reminiscent of the pandemic where all production is shut down, at least in the US it seems like an opportune time to rethink your entire content strategy. So are you thinking differently at all about how you produce, what you produce, what your costs are? Just anything you can say about how NBCU may change its approach to content in coming years? And then on advertising, the upfront, I guess, is still dragging on.\nCan you talk about what you're seeing, where there's strength, weakness, and where the dollars are being allocated to what platforms? And I think that Jason just said that Q3 advertising will be similar to Q2.\n\nMichael Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nSo in terms of content, I'm really pleased with Jessica with the elevation of a couple of my partners at NBC, one of them being Donna Langley, who's one of the most respected people in Hollywood, along with, we've got great leader Pearlena Igbokwe, who runs our TV studios. So I think giving them. A sort of content vertical that's going to work closely with Mark Lazarus on the TV side and platform side and Cesar Conde on News and Telemundo, I think is going to really make. Take advantage of, you know, the company that we have. We're going to obviously be very much focused on creating great content, but I don't. We already do create great content.\nI think when you look at the movie slates we've had and the TV that we produce for ourselves and others, and I think that strategy is going to continue. We're not going to be creating content exclusively for ourselves, but I think it's a great advantage for our studios to actually have platforms that can take a substantial amount, though not all, of the content that we can create, which puts us in a great position to work with all sorts of talent. And creators in Hollywood and elsewhere can come work with our great leadership in our studios, and we help bring their ideas to the life in terms of, you know, cost, strategy, and so forth.\nWe will work in the context of the industry and the buyers and what they're looking for and be responsive to that. But I feel very, very good about the way our studio businesses, you know, are set up in terms of advertising, you know, the market; ad market softened versus last year. It stabilized as it came into this year and has stayed stable. I think that would be, you know, on the back of just uncertainty, economic uncertainty about economic outlook looking forward. I think Jason's comments are we don't see that condition changing as we're looking into Q3 and second half of the year. As you know, I think we feel good about our upfronts.\nYou know, despite those headwinds, our total cash and pricing levels were roughly in line with last year and really strong related to Peacock in particular. But a lot of that comes from the strength of our portfolio, as I've kind of mentioned earlier, where we see strength around Big Ten, Sunday Night Football, Peacock, one platform, and the like, all things that are helping us out quite a bit.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steven Cahill from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven Cahill\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. Just two on the connectivity side of the business. Maybe first on the broadband ARPU, really strong at 4.5%. I was wondering if you could help us unpack that a little bit. Maybe what in there is price increase. How much do you think you're getting from customers up tiering to faster speeds? And maybe what might be coming from cord cutting as some of your Double play video subs go to Single Play, Internet or Internet plus mobile bundles. And then on the international side, where revenue growth is really strong, can you just help us think through what kind of margin contribution you get on international? You know, you talked about more handsets in the quarter.\nI'm guessing those are a little lower margin, as is some of the UK connectivity stuff. As we just think about that as a growth driver, how should we think about the margin or EBITDA contribution from international? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation",
    "content3": "Got it. So let me start with ARPU, and you hit on a couple of the key points. First off, pretty strong performance in the quarter. As we've said, we've seen 4.5%, and there are multiple drivers. There was a little bit more rate that we took early on, not wildly different, but a little bit more that we did in the beginning of the year. I think a critical one for us is tier mix, and we have 1/3 of our base that's a Gigabit Plus, and that 75%, 400 Mbps or higher. That definitely impacts the overall ARPU.\nI think one that maybe not as understood as much as maybe as it should be, but we have a wonderful product called xFi Complete. 25% of our base has that, and let me take one second to describe what's in it. It's a gateway, it's a great gateway that's included in the tier with a path to upgrading the gateway over time. You have an opportunity to do that. Advanced security is included in that, unlimited is included in that. And then a coverage plan making sure your whole house is covered. So xFi Complete is a great tier, good value to customers, 25% of the base. And then there's the bundle discount that you mentioned. When customers go to HSD only you lose the bundle discount.\nAnd so all of those things factor in. So I think it's a positive that there are multiple drivers that are helping. And the thing, Steven, that starts with is just where the market's going, and I mentioned that before, and you have this very stable group of customers that are just using more, and over time that continues to trend up, and we have this balance of a stable base and healthy ARPU growth on international connectivity and the margin side. So this is a great growth area for us. And you look at it from a revenue perspective, just starting with that, because that impacts margin. The revenue increased 26% this quarter, as Jason said in the call.\nAnd the 2/3 of that revenue comes from broadband, which continues to grow at mid-teens level and was driven by a higher level of customers and ARPU compared to a year ago. Remaining 1/3 is wireless, which tends to have more variable growth quarter-to-quarter due to handsets. So you know, this is a solid quarter growth rate, and it will impact margins. But you know, normalizing for the mobile side of things, revenue growth I think of maybe the right level to focus on is more closer to the 20% level for international connectivity.\nI think this is a strong part of the portfolio and a definite contributor towards, as Jason has said, one of the main pillars of not only just domestic broadband and mobile, but also the international broadband and mobile. Jason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, and I think, Steven, you know, important for us as we came into this year with the resegmentation and how we sort of presented out to the world, this was an important category. So international connectivity as we think about Sky and taking the brand name and reputation that they've sort of earned in video and taking that into other products like broadband and wireless the way they have, you know, this quarter, $1 billion in revenue coming from connectivity internationally. So you know, kudos to the team, and I think, you know, important that we've been able to highlight that this street.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks Steve. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS, please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks guys. Maybe a couple questions on profitability. I think maybe for Jason first, really impressive performance on the cable side, 240 basis points, 47%. I mean, how's the visibility into further margin expansion from here? Especially given you've got a couple mix shift issues. Obviously more broadband and less video, but also more wireless. So anything you could tell us about the sort of outlook there and then on the Peacock side doing better in terms of losses. There is $3 billion losses for this year, still the right number for Peacock. And anything you'd say about the sort of path to profitability beyond 2023 would be great. Thanks.\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks John. Good question. So, on, you know, mix and margins in the connectivity business, I think we've had a fairly consistent track record if you look at the last several years of margin expansion, you know, if you look at the core sort of legacy cable business, as we mentioned this quarter, record margin, over 47%. And the factors that have contributed to that historically are in place as we look forward. I think Mike's comments up front about being able to grow revenue, being able to grow margins, that's a key part of it. So to your question specifically on connectivity, there is a mix shift going on when we talk about the six key growth drivers across the company.\nThree are core connectivity growth drivers, whether it's broadband, residential broadband, business services, or wireless. This is an accretive mix shift for us as we think about the way the categories are sort of shifting and what's growing versus what's not growing. So I would look for more of the same, I think, you know, also importantly for the team, for the second consecutive quarter, every expense line in connectivity and platforms was down year-over-year except for direct product costs. And those are the costs that directly support the connectivity and platforms revenue growth in the categories we talked about.\nSo I, you know, outlook for more of the same and continued margin expansion out of the business. I think on Peacock you're right. We came into the year gave guidance for roughly $3 billion in losses. No change to that. As you see, we're pacing to that over the first couple quarters. We've got a lot of incremental content as we think in the back half of the year, as Mike said. So no change to that guidance.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, John. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\n\nVijay Jayant\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. So I think Jason talked about, you know, future expansion of the footprint being a high priority and the bid dollars by state have been sort of allocated. Can you just talk about is that really going to be a big opportunity in terms of, you know, participating in that and you know, driving that footprint? Thanks.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey there, this is Dave. Let me jump into that. So you know, we operate in 39 states where there. Expected BEAD subsidy money, and we're actively engaged both at the federal and state government levels. So you know, as the framework rules of BEAD participation are being developed, you know, we're actively, you know, looking at it and working I think in a good way at all levels. So assuming satisfactory outcomes on the framework rules, we're going to be full participants in bidding where it is consistent with our business goals. But it's too early in the process for us to comment on where we'll bid or the potential win rate.\nBut we're active right now building out edge outs as Jason's talked about. We're going to build out even before any BEAD activity. The BEAD activity by the way is really going to be more rules will come out and be clarified. This is a 2025, 2026 kind of an impact once it clears up. But in the meantime, we're actively edging out and looking at opportunities where it's a profitable return and aggressively pursuing it. So, a million homes passed we expect to build this year alone. So we're going to be aggressive in the meantime. But you know, considering we'll stare closely at it and assuming the satisfactory outcome, we will be participant.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay. Operator, we'll take our last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks guys. Just to drill into broadband in a little bit more detail, the shift from Q1 to Q2 was quite different from what it has been historically in terms of broadband net adds. I'm wondering if you can give us just a little bit more color on how much of that was muted seasonality versus some of the initiatives that you guys have been pushing on the competitive front with low-end broadband offer and the wireless bundles. And in that context you mentioned that wireless is starting to have a bigger pull through impact.\nOn your broadband subs or that they're more new to Comcast subs. Turning to wireless, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more context around that, and then, sorry to pile on, but one last one on wireless for Jason. When we look at Verizon's wholesale revenue, it seems to have flattened over the course of the last three quarters, which suggests that maybe you're getting some gross margin expansion in the wireless business. I'm wondering if that's accurate. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson\n\nCEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nHey there. So this is Dave. Let me start on the broadband part and a little bit on wireless. So, you know, as we saw, you know, the base is stable 32 million. And this is sequentially, year-over-year, for this quarter. We also flagged, you know, we talked about this last quarter. We expected more normal seasonal activity so that net adds would be lower than Q1. But we also expected a more muted step down in net adds from Q1 to Q2. This is a combination of lower overall move activity, the overall macro issues that we've experienced over the past year in the market. At the same time, you know, we did, as you brought up, we go in and out in terms of offers.\nWe had some offers really targeted in the multiple segments that we served, more on the lower end, and we had, you know, some traction on some of that. So that did help. We'll continue to be opportunistic, you know, throughout the year. You know, as I mentioned before, to your point on wireless, we absolutely, aggressively package mobile with broadband. This is for new and existing customers. So mobile is a great extension of the relationship in a really profitable way to existing customers that are HSV only. It's one of the key things that we do, and I think over time we're going to continue to stay focused on that.\nI think as much of an opportunity to grow the mobile business and really help broadband is going to the base as well as attracting new customers. So it's a double win from our perspective. Jason?\n\nJason Armstrong\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nYeah, just. Jonathan, thanks for the question on wireless. Can't speak to Verizon and their revenue trajectory. I know they've got a few different things in the wholesale revenue category beyond just cable, but I can't speak to obviously the economics of our business. We're happy with it. We think it's good business for Verizon. That's sort of what they said yesterday as they think about traffic and ways to fill up their network. But for us specifically, we've got a revenue stream coming in from customers. We have a wholesale deal with Verizon to accommodate that traffic where there's outflows. But then we're also trying to offload as much traffic as we can on our own network.\nWe've got a fairly efficient acquisition vehicle in that. A lot of this is just marketed to our own broadband subscribers. So in terms of acquisition costs, I think we're fairly efficient in the market and then all the way down, sort of closer to cash flow. This is a capital light model which we like. So I'll leave it there.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Thank you everyone for joining us on our Q2 call.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. You'll first hear from Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong. Then Dave Watson will join us and be available for Q&A.\nAs a reminder, beginning this first quarter, we have changed our presentation of segment operating results around 2 primary businesses: Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. For additional details, please refer to our 8-K issued on March 13, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.cmcsa.com.\nI will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our safe harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties.\nIn addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Corp.\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before we get in the quarter, let me just acknowledge the news that you all saw earlier this week. Obviously, a tough moment. But we are so fortunate to have a fabulous and tenured leadership team at NBCUniversal. You go down the list, you'll see many of them have been leading their divisions within the company for at least 10 years and are truly the best in the business.\nWe're also lucky to have Mike Cavanagh step in at the helm at NBCUniversal while also remaining President. Mike is a fantastic executive and operator that many of you know well. He'll work closely with each of the management team at NBCUniversal to continue our excellent momentum.\nMike, alongside with Jason Armstrong, will lead these earnings calls on a go-forward basis. Today, you'll hear from them about our strategic focus and drivers of growth now and over the long term. Jason will go into much greater details on the first quarter results. Dave Watson and I are here for Q&A. You'll hear a lot more about the great momentum of our Connectivity & Platforms businesses later in the call. Dave, thanks for getting off to a great start this year.\nBut before I hand it over to Mike, I just want to share my quick perspective on our recent performance. This really was a strong quarter and start to the year, especially within the context of what continues to be a choppy macro environment.\nWe grew adjusted EBITDA by 3% and adjusted EPS by 7%. In addition, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders all while continuing to invest importantly in a number of major initiatives, which is a real testament to our very healthy balance sheet.\nTwo things amongst many highlights in particular that stand out for me, and I'm really proud of. One is the animation business. By strengthening and combining our capabilities across DreamWorks and Illumination led by Chris Meledandri, we've had tremendous success creating franchises that people know and love all over the world: Despicable Me, Shrek, Pets, Minions and more recently, Puss in Boots and now Super Mario Bros., which just broke a number of records, including the biggest worldwide opening of any animated film all time. These are the results of the strategic decision we made years ago to become a leader in animation and the conviction we've had to continue to invest in the business even during the depths of the pandemic, which are now clearly paying off.\nThe second is Connectivity & Platforms. The significant margin expansion that we achieved this quarter, coupled with the 4.5% ARPU growth domestic residential broadband, demonstrates successful discipline and excellent management in a challenging competitive environment. We're focused on delivering a superior experience and profitably serving our customers, and it shows.\nAnd with that, let me now hand the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comcast Corp.\n\nThanks, Brian. We had a great start to 2023 and have set ourselves up for another strong year. We have amazing talent at all levels of our company and DNA that fosters creativity and collaboration, resulting in operational excellence that is second to none. Couple that with our position as a scaled leader in very large and profitable markets with tens of millions of customers paying us over $100 per month as well as hundreds of millions of TV and streaming viewers, and we have an extremely healthy balance sheet, enabling us to invest in all of our strategic opportunities and for great returns while also returning a healthy amount of capital to shareholders.\nAs pleased as we are with our results in the first quarter, any company's performance in a quarter is just a milestone of progress against the longer-term strategy and plan. And so before we dive deeper into the details of the last few months, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the drivers of our growth over the longer term and where we're focusing most of our time and resources.\nI put these in 4 buckets: residential connectivity, business services connectivity, our theme parks and experiences and our premium content creation. I'll start with residential connectivity, which is comprised of domestic broadband, domestic wireless and international connectivity.\nBroadband is a fantastic business. It's a great product for the consumer, and demand continues to rise. People are connecting more and more devices to our network, and they're consuming a tremendous amount of data.\nRight now, the average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes. And there is a related increase in the importance of reliability and speed with roughly 1/3 of our customers at 1 gigabit or higher and nearly 3/4 at or above 400 megabits.\nFor us, the consumers' already high and increasing level of expectation for their broadband experience is an important trend. And while the marketplace is competitive such that adding subs in the near term is likely to be a challenge, I fully expect we will eventually return subscriber growth. We have the best hand out there to win against all the competing technologies, whether it's fiber or fixed wireless.\nWe view fiber as our long-term competitor. We have been successfully competing against fiber for about 20 years, yet still built a base of 32 million broadband customers over this time period. Our strategy is to have the most robust network, which we're making even better as we transition to DOCSIS 4.0 and surrounding our industry-leading broadband experience with multiple services that provide additional value.\nAnd now we have the ability to offer the consumer a converged connectivity package that includes a great wireless product based on a capital-light model with favorable economics combined with excellent Wi-Fi. A more recent competitor is fixed wireless, which we view as a substandard and temporary solution for a certain segment based on their needs at this moment in time. Our approach is to compete rationally.\nWe know how to segment the market. We have packages that cater to customers who want the very fastest speeds and premium features and others that are more targeted to those looking for value-oriented solutions.\nWe trialed a couple of offers targeted to this lower end during the quarter. We were pleased with the results, and we'll continue to remain nimble and respond competitively in each segment. In the meantime, as the residential connectivity market and macroeconomic environment continue to evolve, our focus will be on serving our existing base, growing broadband ARPU, increasing our penetration in wireless and making proactive investments to expand our footprint at the fastest pace in our history. You saw us do this all of last year and in the first quarter, and I expect this trend to continue.\nOur second major growth opportunity, business services, which is approaching $10 billion in annual revenue, is growing at mid-single digits with newly reported margins just shy of 60% and delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit range. Here too, our advanced and adaptable network infrastructure is much better suited to serving commercial and government locations compared to the legacy wireline and wireless providers.\nWe move fast and are more capable of reliably and cost effectively meeting our customers' needs. We already have over 2.5 million domestic business customers, more than any other competitor and are targeting a $50 billion market opportunity within our footprint and a $70 billion to $100 billion total market opportunity that we can now go after by leveraging our technology and partners outside of our footprint.\nOur third major growth opportunity is in creating experiences from our own intellectual property as well as special IP that we license from others and bring to life at our theme parks like Harry Potter or Nintendo's characters like Mario. Our parks are resonating with our customers, and this segment is clearly on a roll. Japan has come roaring back, and Beijing returned to profitability following last year when both were operating under COVID-related restrictions.\nAnd on the domestic side, Orlando continues to do well, and Hollywood just opened Super Nintendo World with great success. This outstanding performance provides us with even more confidence that the investments we are making in new lands and attractions will also generate strong returns.\nAnd I'm excited for what's to come: Donkey Kong, another Nintendo land to open in Japan in 2024, Epic Universe in Orlando in 2025, as well as the smaller park concepts that we recently announced: a horror-themed experience in Las Vegas and a new park in Texas that's specifically designed for younger guests and their families.\nOur fourth growth area is content and especially on the streaming side. We have a decades-deep library of iconic films in television. And we spend over $20 billion each year to produce and provide programming that spans every genre, sports, news, entertainment, dramas and film, which has resulted in the broadest reach of any media company. Over 100 million people engage with our content every month.\nIn film, we were #2 in the worldwide box office last year with Jurassic, Minions and Halloween. And based on the current course, we are trending to do even better in 2023. We've started the year off with home runs and terrific momentum, carryover from Puss in Boots, the success from M3GAN and now Super Mario Bros., which in just 3 weekends has already crossed $875 million at the global box office.\nWe're really proud of our animation business. We've been in the movie business for 100 years, and it's exciting how we've been able to create and monetize our entire movie slate in animation and beyond and in so many ways, including the innovative changes we've made in movie windowing.\nWe made the strategic decision to put our Pay-One window on Peacock, which really kicked in at the end of last year. We now have one of the most robust movie offerings on streaming. The hits we have at the box office roll on to Peacock, and this is proving to be both a successful acquisition and retention tool.\nAdd to that, the strength of content from our TV studio, which powers the content on NBC and helped make us #1 for many years from all the Dick Wolf procedurals and SNL coupled with highly popular content on Bravo, this all goes to Peacock the next day. Add to this our originals, where we were just getting started, shows like Poker Face, which launched and immediately landed near the top of Nielsen's U.S. streaming original list. And we have lots more coming.\nOn top of all of this, we have an incredible lineup of sports, Sunday Night Football, Premier League and soon, Big 10. We believe we have the right strategy for Peacock and one that's suited to our strengths: premium content with a dual revenue stream, both advertising and subscription fees. And we're encouraged by our results so far, growing paid subscribers and engagement levels to roughly 20 hours per subscriber per month, fueling strong growth in advertising revenues. We're investing, but the results we are seeing give us confidence that we are on the right path for Peacock to breakeven and grow from there.\nLooking across our entire organization, I couldn't think of a more advantageous position to be in to monetize the increasing expectations [indiscernible] demand as well as the changing habits of the global consumer. We're the best broadband company with the best content that can be accessed over the best distribution and aggregation platforms.\nI'm excited about all of our areas of growth. Together, they represent the majority of our revenue and our businesses with high incremental margins. As a result, these growth areas should become the dominant driver of our financial results for years to come.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jason to talk about the quarter.\n\nJason S. Armstrong\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In late February, we announced that starting this quarter, we will be reporting our results in 2 reportable business units: Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. More closely align our like-minded businesses reflect how we run our company and highlight our opportunities for growth as a globally integrated content distribution company. We're also providing more disclosure around areas that have become increasingly important to our overall results, namely business services and Peacock.\nLet's start with our consolidated first quarter results on Slide 4. Total company revenue of $29.7 billion declined 4% due to tough comparison to last year's Winter Olympics and Super Bowl as well as the negative impact of foreign currency, while our total company adjusted EBITDA grew 3%, thanks to continued strong operating leverage at our high-margin Connectivity & Platforms business.\nExcluding the impacts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl and adjusting for constant currency, total company revenue increased 1.5%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $0.92 and generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first quarter.\nThis is in addition to significant investments to support and grow our businesses, including our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 and footprint expansion in broadband, the construction of Epic as well as consistent flow of new lands and attractions at our theme parks and content production at our studios, which feeds into Peacock, a robust third-party licensing opportunity and a really successful film business. When taken together, these investment areas generated over half of total company revenue in the first quarter with growth of 10% year-over-year.\nNow let's turn to our business results. Starting on Slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was down over 9% year-over-year. So in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I'll speak to our results at Connectivity & Platforms on a constant currency basis.\nRevenue was flat this quarter, but this is worth unpacking. Our core connectivity revenues, residential and business, grew over 7% to $10 billion, while video, advertising and other revenues declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Year-over-year, we generated 160 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms on a total basis. This is reflective of our strategy of investing in and driving growth in high-margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost control.\nTo get into more detail, residential connectivity revenue grew by 8% with 5% growth in domestic broadband, 27% growth in wireless and 18% growth in international. In business services connectivity, revenue continued to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace.\nOur domestic residential broadband customer base this quarter remained stable over both the last year and in the quarter with churn remaining below pre-pandemic levels. While we had some success towards the end of the quarter with a couple of offers targeting the lower end of the market, the broadband environment remains highly competitive right now, particularly at the lower end. And as such, our view remains that 2023 will be a challenging period for us to add subs.\nOur outlook for growth and our strategy has been consistent. We will compete aggressively but do so in a financially disciplined way. While we expect to return to growth in broadband subscribers over time, during this interim period as well as over the longer term, we will focus on protecting and growing broadband ARPU.\nAnd we're pleased with the 4.5% year-over-year increase in ARPU in the quarter. We expect continued strong revenue growth over the course of 2023 and expect ARPU will be the primary driver.\nGrowth in domestic wireless revenue was a function of higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which are up 1.4 million or 32% year-over-year to 5.7 million in total, including the 355,000 lines we just added, which was a record high for a first quarter. There is clearly demand for a converged offering that delivers reliable and fast speeds, both in and out of the home. We are extremely well positioned to take advantage of this trend and have a long runway for growth as less than 10% of our broadband accounts currently take our mobile offering.\nA new disclosure category for us is international connectivity. Roughly 2/3 of international connectivity revenue is broadband, growing at mid-teens levels. The remaining 1/3 is wireless, of which a big portion comes from device sales and therefore, tends to fluctuate with the timing of device launches. The rest of wireless is service revenue, which is growing nicely due to additional customer lines and healthy ARPU growth.\nThe strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video due to customer losses relative to last year, in other revenue reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice and in advertising, which was impacted by a tough macro environment in addition to lower political revenue in our domestic markets.\nOn the expense side, every expense line item declined in the first quarter with the exception of direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. The strong execution by the team to deliver sustainable operating efficiencies, coupled with solid growth in our high-margin connectivity businesses, resulted in Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA growth of 4% to $8.1 billion. And as I mentioned a moment ago, an adjusted margin expanding 160 basis points year-over-year.\nAnd that is despite some temporary margin headwinds in our international business associated with some pressure on revenue due to a challenging macro environment and higher programming costs for sports channels, which were up this year given the timing of events.\nMargin for our domestic legacy Cable business improved 250 basis points, reaching a record high of 46.5%. We've added disclosure this quarter and going forward to break down profitability between residential and business services. Residential Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA grew 3% with margin improving 140 basis points to reach 37.8%, highlighting favorable revenue mix shifts.\nBusiness services connectivity EBITDA grew 8%, with margin expanding 150 basis points to reach 58.3%. Over the years, we've talked about business services as a driver of margin accretive growth, and we're excited to augment our disclosure in this area for the first time. Our results in the quarter and our new reporting structure clearly show that. This is a business that generated over $5 billion of EBITDA in 2022 with substantial growth ahead and should be a material contributor to our growth profile in Connectivity & Platforms and overall.\nWrapping up on Connectivity & Platforms, I'm proud of the team successfully navigating a transition in which we're managing businesses that have secular headwinds with an appropriately high level of cost discipline while investing in others that clearly have strong revenue growth and margin characteristics.\nNow let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 6. Content & Experiences revenue decreased nearly 10%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.5 billion of revenue from the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl reported in our Media segment. And EBITDA decreased 1% as a record first quarter at parks and strong studio growth driven by a successful film slate was offset by the planned increase in our Peacock investment as well as lower linear advertising sales.\nUnpacking these results further, Media revenue decreased 21% on an as-reported basis and 2% when excluding the Olympics and Super Bowl primarily due to a 6% decline in domestic advertising, reflecting softness in the overall ad market, which appears to have stabilized, offset somewhat by strong growth in Peacock advertising revenue. When you exclude Olympics and Super Bowl, Peacock advertising increased an impressive 90%.\nDomestic distribution revenue decreased 8% but was up 4% excluding the Olympics driven by Peacock with distribution revenue up 83%. In total, Peacock revenue increased by 45% to $685 million, led by strong growth in paid subscribers, which were up over 60% year-over-year, ending the quarter with nearly 22 million paid subs, which marked another terrific milestone on our path to scaling the service.\nWe're encouraged with the trends we're seeing at Peacock. While we've proven that special content and major events like the World Cup at the end of last year can be significant acquisition drivers, perhaps equally or even more important is sustaining engagement following this type of acquisition content and delivering on retention.\nWe saw that in the first quarter. And we look forward to reporting further momentum in the enhanced disclosures we're now providing for Peacock, including the revenue breakdown between advertising and distribution and costs separated by programming and production versus marketing, promotion and other.\nAnother new category that we added to our Media disclosure is international networks. This is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports, and the low single-digit revenue increase in the quarter was driven by higher distribution revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Other revenue decreased 21% due to lower content licensing.\nMedia EBITDA decreased 26%, including a $704 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We view Media as one business. And while we have made cost reductions at our linear networks, we reallocated some of these resources to Peacock with the goal of maximizing profitability over the short and long term across streaming and linear. We continue to expect Peacock losses for the year to be around $3 billion, which we believe will be peak losses for Peacock and then begin to steadily improve.\nAt Studios, this was a great quarter for our film slate with strong theatrical revenue growth driven by the successful carryover from Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, which launched at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as new releases such as M3GAN and Cocaine Bear.\nWhile revenue growth was partially offset by lower content licensing at our television studios, the momentum in our film business drove a 13% increase in Studio EBITDA, which also included marketing and promotion expense associated with the April 5 release of Super Mario Bros., which is fueling a strong start to our second quarter.\nAt Theme Parks, revenue grew 25% and EBITDA 46% to $658 million, thanks to a continued rebound following the lift of COVID restrictions and a testament to the significant investments we've made at our parks. While demand and financial results were strong across the board, our international parks drove most of the growth this quarter.\nWith Japan no longer impacted by COVID restrictions, our park in Osaka continued to rebound. And we are seeing significant demand for Super Nintendo World, which we opened in 2021. Given the COVID-related restrictions that were in place, many people couldn't visit the park.\nOur park in Beijing was also impacted by COVID-related restrictions last year and is now growing at a very healthy rate. Beijing showed strong year-over-year improvement and was profitable in the quarter despite normal winter seasonal headwinds.\nOn the domestic side, Hollywood enjoyed record first quarter results due to the very successful opening of Super Nintendo World, while Orlando continues to trend above pre-pandemic levels.\nI'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing a high level of working capital and making meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 37% increase in total capital spending primarily driven by higher CapEx.\nAt Connectivity & Platforms, CapEx increased 30% with CapEx intensity coming in at 9.7% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network. In 2022, CapEx intensity at Connectivity & Platforms was 10%. And we expect to achieve a similar level in 2023, which is inclusive of the prior guidance we provided for our domestic Cable business at year-end as we continue to transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0 as well as accelerate our growth in homes passed.\nContent & Experiences CapEx increased by $343 million driven by parks with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. As we noted on our year-end call, we expect park's CapEx in 2023 to increase by around $1.2 billion, remain elevated in 2024 and then decrease in 2025, the year we open Epic.\nWrapping up, since this is my first quarter as CFO, let me reiterate our capital allocation framework. First is to invest for growth in our businesses. We've talked through many examples today: Epic, our broadband network, streaming and aggregation to name a few.\nSecond is to protect our balance sheet position with targeted leverage of around 2.4x. This is an optimal level, we believe, to maintain broad and deep capital markets access through a cycle, balanced prudently with the opportunity for enhanced levered equity returns.\nThird is to return cash to shareholders. I'm proud that we bought back $12 billion of stock in the last 12 months, including $2 billion this quarter, shrinking our share count by 7% in that time frame in addition to a healthy and growing dividend, which we just increased by over 7% in January.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Marci for Q&A. Marci?\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open up the call for questions, please.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. On this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong, who are also joined by Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A.\nLet me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman & CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of how our team executed throughout 2022. We achieved the highest levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our company's history. And we returned a record $17.7 billion of capital to shareholders - through both our recurring dividend, which we just increased for the 15th consecutive year, and robust share repurchase activity. We did all this while accelerating investment in key growth initiatives, which are showing great progress, particularly our broadband network as we transition to 10G, but also in Xfinity Mobile, Peacock and our theme parks.\nI attribute all this success to the incredible talent across our organization, who work collaboratively to ensure we are constantly evolving and innovating so that our customers have the absolute best experience with us at every point of interaction. What also sets us apart is our very strong balance sheet, which, when combined with the cost actions we have taken this past quarter, position us to perform well no matter what the macro environment might bring.\nI want to start with Cable, where our financial performance both for the year and the fourth quarter confirm that: we are striking the right balance between rate and volume in residential broadband and we plan to continue to do so in 2023, that Xfinity Mobile and Comcast business remain strong growth drivers, and that we have successfully identified the appropriate mix between cutting costs to drive efficiencies, and investing for our future. We have always maintained an intense focus on providing the absolute best products and experiences, which comes down to having the highest capacity, most reliable and most efficient broadband network.\nOur evolution to 10G and the unique way we are pursuing this through DOCSIS 4.0 is a huge benefit for our customers across the entire footprint as they will all have access to an entire ecosystem built around multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, some as early as this year. It's also great for the company and our investors as our transition to a virtual, software-based network - infused with the marvelous AI capabilities - will not only provide tangible benefits when it comes to operating and capital expenses, but it will enable us to innovate faster than ever before, solidifying our leadership position in broadband, which is extremely important given what is certain to be continued increases in demand for both speed and usage.\nIn fact, we continue to see signs of this today. Our residential broadband-only customers are now consuming nearly 700 gigabytes of data every month. And customers on our Gigabit Plus products now comprise roughly 1/3 of our broadband subscribers.\nIn addition to creating more value from our current customer base and further penetrating the total homes and businesses that we pass today, another great opportunity is for us to extend our networks to homes and businesses in the U.S. that do not have the ability to receive our services. To that end, we increased our passings by 1.4% or 840,000 in 2022, and we expect to accelerate in 2023, where we are aiming to add around 1 million while still maintaining the same CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2022, reaching nearly 62.5 million by the end of the year. We are taking a disciplined approach, and we'll only pursue those areas that have a return profile similar to what we have been able to historically achieve.\nWireless is playing an integral part of our overall strategy at Cable, and it's an area where we continue to shine. This past quarter was another record in net line additions, bringing us to over 5 million total lines in just 5 years. With only 9% penetration of our current base of residential broadband customers, we have plenty of runway ahead. And we're just getting started in offering wireless to our commercial segment, which is another great example of how we are selling more products into our existing base of business customers. When you combine our broadband network, WiFi overlay and MVNO with Verizon, we are in the best position to win in convergence. We have a leg up on our competitors with a capital-light strategy that does not involve customer or network trade-offs.\nAt NBCUniversal, we are seeing some great momentum in Peacock and Parks. And - across all of NBCUniversal - our intellectual property is really resonating. We had the #2 studio in terms of worldwide box office in 2022, fueled by a strong slate, including Jurassic, Minions, Nope, Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Black Phone, Halloween, which have also had great carryover success to Peacock through our Pay-One window and select day-and-date releases. And our box office momentum continued into the first quarter with M3GAN. So, all in all, a really strong film slate.\nPeacock ended the year with over 20 million paying subscribers, more than double where we started; and we added over 5 million paid subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. Our success was broad-based, fueled by some of the films I just mentioned, but also sporting events like the World Cup, NFL, Premier League, several new originals and our exclusive next-day broadcast of NBC and Bravo. Looking ahead, and based on our experience to date, we expect our subscriber cadence will follow our content launches, which fall more heavily in the second half of '23. And we continue to see positive trends in engagement, churn and ARPU.\nMark Woodbury had a fabulous first year as our CEO of the Parks business and we hit a number of new records this past quarter. It was the highest fourth quarter EBITDA for the entire segment, led by Orlando and Hollywood, and Japan had the best EBITDA performance since 2019. This was driven by attendance that far surpassed pre-pandemic levels at all 3 parks. And while attendance at our park in Beijing was significantly impacted by COVID in 2022, we are seeing some exciting demand to start the year.\nGiven the excellent returns we have generated to date, we continue to seek ways to expand our Parks and I'm really excited about our 2 recently announced extensions: the first Universal Park designed specifically for younger audiences near Dallas and the first year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas. These are new innovative ways to utilize our substantial IP, including from DreamWorks and Illumination, while also extending our brand, both of which should help fuel growth in all of our parks.\nIn our linear video business, we are managing subscriber declines by taking a disciplined approach to our cost base. We are continuing to invest in our global technology platform, and you will see a number of announcements from us in the weeks and months ahead. For example, in 2023, we will launch one global user interface for Sky Glass, Xfinity, X1, Flex, Xumo and our U.S. and international partners. Every entertainment customer around the world will get the same Emmy Award-winning, voice controlled experience. This scale not only brings us operational efficiencies, but it also puts us in the enviable position when it comes to conversations with distributors, OEMs, programmers, app developers and talent.\nAt Sky, we are managing through the macroeconomic challenges in Europe, while staying intensely focused on retention and continuing to provide our customers with the best entertainment and connectivity experiences. We're seeing some encouraging results. In the U.K., Sky Glass had the top-selling UHD TV model; Sky Mobile is the fastest-growing mobile provider, surpassing 3 million lines; and we are narrowing the gap between us and the current #1 broadband provider, with Sky Broadband now sitting at over 6.5 million subscribers.\nWrapping up, our consistently strong financial performance, healthy balance sheet and record high return of capital to shareholders underscore how the scale, capabilities and talent across our company enable us to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy. I'm convinced we are on the right path and that we have the right team to capture our many opportunities and overcome whatever challenges happen along the way.\nSo before handing over the call, I want to congratulate Jason Armstrong, recently promoted to Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Mike Cavanagh. I could not be more confident in the leadership team's ability to continue to drive us forward and create more value for our shareholders. Mike, over to you.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nPresident, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to just say that it's been a pleasure serving as CFO of Comcast for the last 7-plus years. And I couldn't be prouder to have Jason be my successor, knowing that - with Jason - the financial leadership of our company is in proven and expert hands. Since Jason didn't take over as CFO until early in the new year, I will handle the CFO portion of this call and hand it over to Jason for the first quarter call in April.\nSo now I'll begin on Slides 4 and 5 to discuss our consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased just under 1% to $30.6 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.3% to $121.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% to $8 billion for the fourth quarter and increased 5% to $36.5 billion for the full year. The quarterly results include severance expenses booked in each of our businesses, totaling $638 million, which is $541 million higher than the prior year period. Excluding this increase, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year.\nAdjusted EPS increased 6.5% to $0.82 a share for the fourth quarter and 13% to $3.64 for the full year. And we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $12.6 billion for the full year, while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and Theme Parks as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. Cable revenue increased 1.4% to $16.6 billion. EBITDA increased 1.5% to $7.2 billion, and Cable EBITDA margins improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 43.5%. These results include $345 million of severance expense, which is $305 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding severance, Cable EBITDA increased 5.8%, and Cable EBITDA margin improved by 190 basis points to a record high of 45.3%.\nThese strong results also included the impact of Hurricane Ian in Southwest Florida, which resulted in the loss or severe damage to many homes we serve in this market. Excluding the hurricane impacts, we would have added approximately 4,000 broadband customers versus the 26,000 loss we reported. And we estimate that we would have lost approximately 36,000 customer relationships versus the 71,000 we reported. Overall, our broadband customer results in the fourth quarter were fairly consistent with the prior 2 quarters, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections, offset by churn, which remained well below 2019 levels.\nNow let's discuss Cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 1.4% was driven by higher broadband, wireless, business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 5.4%, driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base when compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.8% year-over-year when adjusting for some COVID-related customer credits last year. This organic ARPU growth is similar to the growth we've generated over the last couple of quarters and is consistent with our strategy.\nWe are focused on optimizing our customer relationships by consistently adding more capabilities, services and value so as to provide the best broadband experience, which has and should continue to deliver broadband ARPU growth. The elements of growth this quarter include increased rate, attaching more customers to higher tiers as well as other services. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2023.\nWireless revenue increased 25%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines in 2022, including 365,000 lines in the fourth quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record.\nBusiness services revenue increased 4.6%, which includes the results of Masergy in both this quarter and in the prior year period, as we lapped the closing of this acquisition at the beginning of the quarter. Revenue growth was primarily driven by rate, including customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products and rate increases on some of our services.\nAdvertising revenue increased 9.1%, driven by strong political revenue, partially offset by the absence of advertising revenue that is now part of Xumo, our joint venture with Charter. Adjusting for those items, Cable advertising revenue decreased 1.6%, reflecting a decline in our local core advertising business, partially offset by solid growth at our advanced advertising business.\nVideo revenue declined 5.6%, driven by year-over-year customer net losses, partially offset by ARPU growth of 5.8% due to a residential rate increase we implemented at the beginning of 2022. And last, voice revenue declined 13%, primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses.\nTurning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 1.4%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses, which included the $305 million in higher severance costs, partially offset by lower programming expenses. Programming expenses decreased 5.9%, reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customers, partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses, which, again include $305 million in higher severance costs, increased 5.6%. Excluding severance, these expenses were flat compared to last year, reflecting an increase in bad debt as we returned to more normalized pre-pandemic levels, and increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business. These were offset by a decline in marketing and promotion and customer service expenses due to lower activity levels, efficiencies in running the business and improvements we continue to make in our customer experience.\nOur focus on growing our high-margin connectivity businesses, coupled with our focus on increasing operating efficiency and cost controls, drove strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2022. Excluding the higher severance expense, we grew full year EBITDA by 5.7% and increased EBITDA margins by 110 basis points to 44.8%. We believe that our disciplined approach to running the business, including the benefits from our cost reduction efforts this quarter, position us to drive higher profitability and further expand margins both in 2023 and thereafter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% to $9.9 billion, and EBITDA decreased 36% to $817 million, including $182 million of severance expense in the quarter. Excluding severance, EBITDA decreased 22%. Media revenue increased 2.6% to $6 billion, mainly driven by Peacock, which nearly doubled its revenue to $660 million, and Telemundo's broadcast of the World Cup.\nAdvertising revenue increased 4%, reflecting an incremental $263 million from the World Cup, as well as strong growth at Peacock and a healthy contribution of political advertising, partially offset by a decline in linear advertising. If we exclude the World Cup, advertising revenue declined 5.6%, reflecting softening in the overall advertising market.\nDistribution revenue increased 3.8%, reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers, which more than doubled compared to last year as well as higher contractual rates at our networks, partially offset by linear subscriber declines.\nMedia EBITDA was $132 million in the fourth quarter, including a $978 million EBITDA loss at Peacock, reflecting the cost of new content such as our exclusive next-day broadcast and Bravo content, our robust lineup of Pay-One titles, day-and-date releases like Halloween Ends, NFL, Premier League and the World Cup. Peacock's full year EBITDA loss of $2.5 billion was in line with the outlook we provided a year ago. And for 2023, we expect Peacock losses to be up modestly to around $3 billion.\nAs we've said previously, we believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and, from there, steadily improve. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA in the fourth quarter decreased 13%, reflecting the lower revenue and fairly flat expenses despite the higher costs associated with broadcasting the World Cup. Looking to the first quarter, while we remain focused on managing costs, we expect underlying Media EBITDA, excluding Peacock, to continue to be impacted by the top line pressures at our linear networks.\nMoving to Studios, revenue increased 13% to $2.7 billion driven by growth in content licensing and theatrical revenue. Content licensing was up 16% driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows as well as healthy growth in television licensing. Theatrical revenue increased 47% due to the success of recent releases, including Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Violent Night and Halloween Ends. EBITDA increased $109 million to $160 million for the quarter, reflecting the higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, reflecting the size and timing of this quarter's theatrical slate as well as the corresponding higher programming and production costs.\nAt Theme Parks, revenue increased 12% to $2.1 billion, while EBITDA increased 16% to $782 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record for a fourth quarter. These results were driven by growth at our parks in the U.S. and Japan, partially offset by our park in Beijing, which was negatively impacted by COVID-related restrictions. At our U.S. parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending up year-over-year and with Orlando and Hollywood both delivering record high EBITDA for a fourth quarter. Universal Japan continued to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and delivered strong year-over-year EBITDA growth in the quarter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky. Reported results were meaningfully impacted by currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue was relatively consistent compared to last year at $4.4 billion. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting growth in the U.K. driven by wireless and broadband revenue, offset by declines in Germany and Italy.\nOn a customer basis, we added 129,000 customer relationships in the quarter, with positive additions across all 3 territories, the U.K., Italy and Germany. These net additions were driven by streaming, broadband and wireless customer additions and reflect our team's strong execution in a challenging macroeconomic environment across Europe.\nRounding out the rest of Sky revenue. Content revenue increased 6.5% driven by licensing our entertainment content. And advertising revenue decreased 9.6%, primarily driven by lower revenue in the U.K., reflecting the timing of the World Cup and the macro environment.\nTurning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15% to $340 million, including $89 million of severance expense, which is $53 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding severance, EBITDA declined 2% compared to last year, reflecting an increase in direct network costs - driven by growth in our residential mobile and broadband businesses - and higher other expenses, which were mostly offset by lower programming costs due to the timing of sports programming as 4 weeks of EPL games were paused during the fourth quarter to accommodate the World Cup. However, we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the games which were paused are now played.\nNow I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2022, we generated around $12.6 billion in free cash flow, while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and Theme Parks, as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID.\nFull year consolidated total capital investment increased 14.2% or $1.7 billion to $13.8 billion, due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable, partially offset by a decrease at Sky. At Cable, total capital spending increased 8.3% or $695 million with CapEx intensity coming in at 11.4%, primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network. In 2023, we expect CapEx intensity to stay at around 11%, similar to 2022 levels, as we aim to accelerate our homes passed growth to about 1 million and continue to transition our entire broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 over the next few years.\nNBCUniversal total capital spending increased $1.4 billion driven by Parks CapEx increasing $1.1 billion, of which Epic was around $800 million and reflects our continued investment in new attractions like Super Nintendo World at Hollywood and Donkey Kong at Japan. In 2023, we expect Parks CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion over last year as we continue to build Epic, which we plan to open in 2025 and begin work on our recently announced park extensions mentioned earlier.\nThe required investment to develop these extensions is nowhere near the scale of Epic or Universal Beijing but rather enable us to leverage our already large market opportunity and can serve as a model that contributes to even higher growth at Theme Parks in the future. Working capital was $3 billion for the year, a $1.5 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in content creation.\nTurning to capital allocation. We ended the year with net leverage at 2.4x and returned a total of $17.7 billion to shareholders, including $4.7 billion in dividend payments and $13 billion in share repurchases. For 2023, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns.\nAs we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1.16 per share, our 15th consecutive annual increase. This reflects our long-standing, balanced capital allocation policy. We're committed to investing organically in the businesses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and also returning a very healthy amount of capital to shareholders.\nThanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A.\nLet me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman & CEO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of the company and our results this quarter. We are reporting adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%, adjusted EPS growth of 10% and significant free cash flow while also investing in our future and returning a record high amount of capital to our shareholders. The strong financials today are a testament to our focus on driving profitable growth through innovation as well as a reflection on the professionalism of our employees. Together, I believe we are collaborating and executing at the highest levels.\nI especially want to recognize and publicly thank all of our teammates in Florida as well as those who traveled to Florida over the last several weeks. They worked tirelessly to assist customers who were impacted by Hurricane Ian, even while many of these employees had their own losses. This was a devastating storm, particularly for us, as we are the primary cable operator in most of the areas where it hit, and we expect this affected about half of our traditional Florida seasonal customers.\nDigging into the third quarter, our results at Cable Communications, again, underscored the impressive consistency in this business with 5% EBITDA growth and 120 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion, bringing us to 45.1%, our highest margin on record. While we are still in a challenging environment in terms of depressed move activity and increased competition from new entrants, we were pleased to see that back-to-school provided a tailwind, and we ended the third quarter with 14,000 net new broadband subscribers.\nThere have been 4 primary drivers of revenue growth at our Cable segment: residential broadband units, residential broadband ARPU, wireless and business services. And while we don't anticipate residential broadband units to be a significant driver for now, we expect to maintain healthy growth in the other 3, leading to continued strong financial performance at Cable for the foreseeable future.\nMy confidence stems from the fact that we have always been able to strike the right balance between units and profitability. We compete aggressively while also staying focused on investing in and managing the business to deliver long-term profitable growth, which is exactly what this quarter has shown. We have a distinct competitive advantage that goes beyond just fast and consistent speeds. We provide a differentiated and superior experience within the home, which is the foundation of our ARPU growth.\nFor example, we offer reliable WiFi coverage in every room, device control and cybersecurity features and a world-class entertainment platform as well as other complementary solutions like Xfinity Mobile that increase the value and utility of our broadband product even more. All of this is only getting better as we further improve our network, and we're making great progress.\nDuring the quarter, we announced that we have begun to roll out multi-gig download speeds combined with up to 5x to 10x faster upload speeds, and we expect to have this available to 20% of our footprint by the end of this year and to the vast majority of our footprint by the end of 2025.\nDirectly on the back of this, we're completing the core technical foundation for 10G, and we're transitioning to a cloud-based virtualized network as we work towards DOCSIS 4.0, which will enable us to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds to customers beginning in the back half of next year.\nLooking further ahead, the combination of our high-capacity network, differentiated broadband experience and our terrific MVNO in wireless puts Comcast in a winning position to offer in-home and mobile connectivity that is both robust and ubiquitous. And it doesn't involve trade-offs, which is going to become even more important as people's level of data consumption and overall expectations continue to rise over time.\nOn average, our broadband customers who don't subscribe to traditional video from us are already using nearly 650 gigabytes of data per month, and that's just today. We are doing a fantastic job leveraging our wireless business. We're still in the very early growth phase in penetrating this segment, and we're having a lot of success.\nWe added 333,000 wireless lines, the most of any quarter to date, and this morning, we announced that we now have over 5 million Xfinity Mobile lines, and we're just getting started. So summing up, we're pleased with our strong financial performance at Cable. We're encouraged by the long-term trends in demand for connectivity and our competitive advantages, and we're confident in our future growth.\nAt NBCUniversal, we saw some great momentum with EBITDA growth of 25% despite the tough comparison to the Tokyo Olympics last year. Our Parks segment continues to be a real standout, generating the highest quarterly EBITDA on record driven by growth at each of our geographies, including Beijing, which hit profitability for the first time since the grand opening last September. We're seeing clear evidence that the investments we made throughout the pandemic continue to pay off.\nWe launched Super Nintendo World in Japan, the VelociCoaster in Orlando, Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood, and our drumbeat of innovation goes on. For example, Super Nintendo World will open in Hollywood early next year. We're adding another Nintendo-themed area, Donkey Kong, to Japan in 2024, and I'm especially excited for Epic Universe to open in the summer of 2025, which will transform Universal Orlando into a week-long destination.\nStudios also performed exceptionally well, resulting from a huge summer box office led by Jurassic World, Minions, Black Phone and Nope. Our leadership is driving change in the industry. Our flexible windowing strategy has enhanced the overall profitability of our Studios business, and it's also had a significant positive carryover to Peacock, which just started to benefit from our new Pay-One agreement.\nAt the end of the third quarter, Peacock had more than 15 million highly engaged paying subscribers in the U.S. On top of that 15 million, Peacock also had approximately 14 million bundled and free users totaling around 30 million monthly active accounts. Peacock has become the best streaming value in the market, providing customers with a massive premium content offering across movies, TV entertainment, sports and news in English and in Spanish. And with less than 5 minutes of ads per hour for just $5 per month, it is really a great value.\nOur sports content is unmatched, with customers enjoying live coverage of the biggest leagues and events, including the NFL with Sunday Night Football, MLB, Premier League, Notre Dame, Big Ten starting in 2023 as well as the WWE; and marquee events, including Super Bowl and Olympics, French Open, U.S. Open, Tour de France, Triple Crown and later this year, the World Cup. We also provide the best of other sports with very passionate fan communities, including IndyCar, Supercross and track and field.\nWe're seeing a nice uplift from our next-day broadcast, which, at last, are exclusively ours. And coming up through the rest of this year and into 2023 is a strong slate of highly anticipated originals from proven creators, including The Best Man, Mrs. Davis, Poker Face and others. While it only launched a little over 2 years ago, Peacock is already an important part of our portfolio and reflects how we're running our Media business holistically.\nSwitching gears, the U.K. and other European markets have been adversely affected by the Ukraine conflict, as we all know, higher energy costs, higher interest rates, higher overall inflation and currency headwinds. This quarter, we took a noncash charge as a result of all of this at Sky based on this environment, which Mike will talk a bit more about.\nOur Sky team is working hard amidst this changing economic backdrop that's putting pressure on the average customer in the region. We remain focused on customer retention as well as providing the best experience and value in entertainment and connectivity, which contributed to the highest quarterly customer growth since we've owned Sky, including some nice momentum in our broadband and wireless business.\nWe are keeping an eye on churn and acknowledge that ARPU may be affected in the future as customers deal with this unstable and inflationary environment. We are successfully managing through a variety of measures, and we remain disciplined on our cost structure. We reset the majority of our major sports rights within the last 2 years and are looking for more efficiencies in a number of areas.\nSo looking at the company as a whole, all of us are paying attention to economists' and other experts' view about how some of these issues in Europe may come to the U.S. And while we are certainly not immune to potential macroeconomic headwinds, I firmly believe that Comcast is in a very strong position relative to our peers and most other companies.\nWe are a leader in very large and highly profitable markets, and our healthy balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation enable us to continue to invest organically in our strategic initiatives while simultaneously returning a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders. We pay nearly $5 billion in dividends per year, and we bought back $9.5 billion of our shares year-to-date through the third quarter.\nWe have a great business, including a fantastic team. Earlier this month, we announced that we promoted Mike Cavanagh to President. For the past 7 years, Mike has been an incredible leader, partner and friend, and we are both very focused on continuing to innovate and grow this wonderful company for all our employees, customers and guests.\nSo it's my pleasure to hand it over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nPresident & CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. I look forward to the new role. It's quite an honor, and I appreciate the trust that you and the Board continue to have in me. I'm excited to work with the leaders on this call, Dana, Dave and Jeff, and all of our colleagues to take advantage of the great opportunities for Comcast's future.\nSo now I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue decreased 1.5% to $29.8 billion, reflecting the comparison to last year's quarter, which included the Tokyo Summer Olympics as well as a headwind from currency translation at Sky and our international theme parks due to the strengthening dollar. After adjusting for both of these items, our revenue was up about 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.9% to $9.5 billion and on a constant currency basis, increased about 8%.\nWe generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow, and we reported an EPS loss of $1.05 per share, which was mainly impacted by an impairment charge at Sky. We test goodwill annually across the company in the third quarter. Challenging economic conditions in the U.K. and other European markets have resulted in a significant increase in discount rates used in the annual impairment analysis and reduced estimated future cash flows at Sky. As a result, we have taken an impairment charge related to Sky goodwill and intangible assets totaling $8.6 billion. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 10% to $0.96 per share. And on a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS increased about 12%.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 2.6% to $16.5 billion driven by higher rate and volume in residential broadband as well as growth in business services, wireless and advertising. The strong growth in these businesses was partially offset by lower revenue in video and voice. Total customer relationships were up 315,000 compared to last year and down 21,000 sequentially in the third quarter.\nDiving further into the details, first, our revenue growth drivers. Broadband revenue increased 5.7%, driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.7% year-over-year, consistent with the growth rate in the second quarter. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in the near term.\nWireless revenue increased 31% mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines over the last year, including 333,000 lines in the quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record and marks the fourth consecutive quarter of adding more than 300,000 lines.\nBusiness services revenue increased 9.4% or approximately 5%, excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in both ARPU and our customer base. We continue to see healthy performance across our diverse customer segments, including SMB, mid-market and enterprise, with this quarter's organic growth driven by a mix shift to higher data speeds and increased sales of our advanced services as well as rate increases and growth in our customer base.\nAdvertising revenue increased 7.2% primarily driven by political and our advanced advertising business, FreeWheel, partially offset by a decline in our local core advertising business and the absence of our streaming business, Xumo. As we previously announced, Xumo is now part of our joint venture with Charter, with those results reported in Corporate and Other.\nIf we exclude the impact of Xumo, cable advertising revenue would have increased 12%. Partially offsetting the growth from these revenue drivers was video revenue, which declined 4.4%, driven by year-over-year customer net losses partially offset by 6% ARPU growth due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year. And last, voice revenue declined 12.5%, primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses.\nTurning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses increased 0.5%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses, mostly offset by lower programming expenses. Programming expenses decreased 2.8%, reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customers partially offset by higher contractual rates.\nNon-programming expenses increased 2.5% driven by growth in other expenses due to an increase in bad debt compared to last year, reflecting a return to more normalized levels and increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business as well as the addition of Masergy.\nThese higher costs were partially offset by a decline in advertising, marketing and promotion expenses partly due to the comparison to last year, which included some Olympic sponsorship spending as well as lower activity levels. The lower activity levels, coupled with the improvements we continue to make in our customer experience, also contributed to the decrease in customer service expenses.\nCable EBITDA increased 5.4% to $7.5 billion in the quarter with Cable EBITDA margins improving 120 basis points year-over-year, reaching a record high of 45.1%. And on a per customer relationship basis, we grew EBITDA 4% as we focus on monetizing these relationships over their lifetime.\nBefore moving to NBCUniversal, Hurricane Ian has impacted our footprint in Southwest Florida, causing outages and damage to our cable network that our cable team is still repairing. Many of our customers' homes and commercial locations were severely damaged or destroyed. While our third quarter results were not impacted by the storm, we expect to report an impact in the fourth quarter, including net losses of broadband customers.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal, starting with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue decreased 4.3% to $9.6 billion, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.8 billion from the Tokyo Olympics included in our Media segment. EBITDA increased 24.6% to $1.7 billion. Media revenue decreased 23% to $5.2 billion, again reflecting the comparison to the revenue associated with the Tokyo Olympics last year. Excluding the Olympics, Media revenue increased 4.4%, driven by Peacock with revenue of $506 million, which more than doubled compared to last year.\nDistribution revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers compared to last year as well as higher contractual rates at our networks partially offset by linear subscriber declines that accelerated sequentially. Advertising revenue increased 4.7%, reflecting strong increases from Peacock partially offset by a decline in linear advertising.\nMedia EBITDA decreased 41.5% to $583 million in the third quarter, including a $614 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year with the fourth quarter's loss reflecting the cost of new content. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA in the third quarter decreased 21%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Tokyo Olympics as well as revenue pressure at our linear networks.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we expect Media growth ex-Peacock to be impacted by a gradual acceleration in pay TV cord cutting as well as some deterioration in the ad market, reflecting broader economic uncertainty as well as higher costs associated with the broadcast of the World Cup on Telemundo.\nMoving to Studios. Revenue increased 31% to $3.2 billion driven by strong theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue more than doubled compared to last year, driven by the success of our summer film slate, including Jurassic World: Dominion, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Black Phone and Nope.\nIn addition, content licensing was up 17%, driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows as well as healthy growth in television licensing. EBITDA increased $358 million to $537 million for the quarter primarily reflecting the higher theatrical and content licensing revenue partially offset by the corresponding higher programming and production costs and also the benefit of the timing of marketing costs that we incurred in the second quarter for films in the third quarter.\nLast, at Theme Parks, revenue increased 42% to $2.1 billion, and EBITDA increased 89% to $819 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record. These results were driven by growth at each of our parks. At Universal Beijing, we had our first profitable quarter since opening compared to the third quarter last year when it incurred $130 million of pre-opening costs.\nAt our U.S. parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending increasing year-over-year. In fact, Orlando broke a new record, delivering its highest level of EBITDA for a third quarter despite the park being closed for 2 days due to Hurricane Ian. Universal Japan continues to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and compared to last year when the park operated under more strict COVID-related controls.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky. As I said earlier, our reported results were meaningfully impacted from the currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was consistent compared to last year at $4.3 billion as low single-digit growth in the U.K. was mostly offset by lower revenue in Italy and Germany.\nDirect-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting low single-digit growth in the U.K. driven by broadband and wireless revenue, offset by declines in Italy and Germany. On a customer basis, we added 320,000 customer relationships in the quarter with positive additions across all 3 territories: the U.K., Italy and Germany.\nThese net additions were driven by streaming customers due to the timing of unique content and the early start of football seasons, including the EPL, to accommodate the timing of the World Cup in the fourth quarter. We do not expect a similar level of additions in the fourth quarter.\nRounding out the rest of revenue at Sky, content revenue increased 6.4% driven by licensing our entertainment content, and advertising revenue decreased 1.6% with lower revenue in Italy and relatively flat revenue in the U.K. and Germany, reflecting the difficult macro environment.\nTurning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15.5% to $701 million, primarily reflecting the timing of sports costs, again, due to the early start of the football seasons and the shift of matches into the third quarter to accommodate the timing of the World Cup in the fourth quarter. While this shift will benefit sports costs in the fourth quarter as 4 weeks of games are paused, results will also be impacted by the challenging economic environment in Europe, and we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the paused games are played.\nNow I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. Consolidated total capital increased 24% due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable partially offset by a decrease at Sky. The increase at NBCUniversal was driven by higher CapEx at parks as we continue to invest in attractions and make significant progress in building Epic Universe in Orlando.\nCable capital spending increased 17% with CapEx intensity coming in at 12.2% due to timing. On a year-to-date basis, Cable CapEx intensity was 10.4%, and we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to be around 11% for the year. Working capital was $1 billion for the third quarter, reflecting the continued ramp in content creation and the timing of annual sports rights payments.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter and look to our year ahead, we remain focused on driving long-term growth during an increasingly challenged economic environment. As a result, we expect we'll be taking severance and other cost reduction-related charges in the fourth quarter in anticipation of expense reduction actions that will provide benefits in 2023 and beyond.\nWrapping up with capital allocation. Last month, we increased our buyback authorization to $20 billion, up from $10 billion, and during the quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion worth of our shares. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the third quarter of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x, in line with our expectations for leverage to remain around 2.4x.\nThanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike.

Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and hello, everyone.\nOur financial results were very strong across the board once again this quarter. We grew second quarter consolidated revenue by 5%, adjusted EBITDA by 10% and adjusted EPS by 20%. We accomplished this while continuing to invest in our businesses and return significant capital to shareholders.\nSpecifically, we bought back $3 billion worth of our stock in the quarter, bringing our total to $6 billion year-to-date. And we continue to have a healthy dividend and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.\nOur prudent financial management and long-term innovation-based strategy are paying off in Cable, which posted 5% growth in EBITDA and 70 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. In fact, our EBITDA margin reached a record high of nearly 45% this quarter.\nWhile we've added nearly 800,000 broadband subscribers in the past 12 months, more recently, that pace has slowed. And we posted flat broadband subscriber additions in the second quarter. I'd like to dig into what we are seeing in that area. Broadband additions, of course, are basically a function of churn and connect activity. While churn remains well below 2019, connect activity was also lower than what we generally see in the second quarter.\nWe believe this is primarily the result of 3 factors. The first category is move activity. As we've discussed for some time now, there's been a dramatic slowdown in moves across our footprint with the second quarter below 2019 by 12% and the lowest we've experienced since the pandemic began. Our win share of new customer acquisition opportunities remains high, but the slowdown in moves has resulted in fewer of these jump balls. And this has had the largest impact on our gross connects.\nThe second category is a reversal of some pandemic trends. During the pandemic, many customers, particularly at lower income levels, sought to optimize home-based solutions by adding broadband. This presented us with significant opportunity to take more share in residential broadband. In fact, in the first year of the pandemic, we added nearly 50% or 600,000 more customers than our prior annual average growth.\nAt this stage in the pandemic, those opportunities have waned as consumer behavior has begun to return to pre-pandemic patterns. And we have also seen some give back to a normalization of mobile substitution.\nIn addition, during the pandemic, seasonality patterns were very different than what we had seen historically. And this really began to also normalize in this second quarter, causing more seasonal disconnects that did not occur at typical levels in the prior 2 years.\nThe last bucket is increased competition. Fixed wireless is a new entrant in the marketplace. And while there are likely to be significant long-term limitations, today's excess capacity in wireless networks is creating what we believe to be a temporary opportunity targeted at value-oriented customers. We are not seeing fixed wireless have any discernible impact on our churn but its early growth appears to be another contributor to our lower connect activity. In addition, we continue to compete against fiber in an increasing percentage of our footprint.\nNotwithstanding these industry and mostly macro-related factors, we remain extremely confident. We have spent decades investing and innovating to build a business that is well positioned to succeed in the environment we're seeing. And we certainly expect a return to residential broadband subscriber additions.\nHow do we plan to do that? Well, we are working hard to expand our footprint, taking advantage of growth in housing and businesses in our current markets, accelerating edge outs into new areas. And we are playing offense when it comes to government subsidies.\nNext, we will continue to aggressively compete for market share. We offer a superior product focused on innovation and differentiation. And we continue to increase the value of broadband by bundling it with Mobile and Flex. And we are making great progress in our network transition to DOCSIS 4.0, which gives us a clear path to reaching multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds at scale faster and at a lower cost relative to our competitors, all within the CapEx intensity levels we have previously outlined.\nI'm also confident and frankly, more excited in our ability to drive revenue and EBITDA growth even through our existing subscriber base alone. We've had a history of generating strong and steady ARPU growth as we continue to add tremendous value and improvement to the customer experience. Our margins are some of the highest in the industry, which highlights the stability and operating leverage of our business, the diversification of our revenue streams and the strength of our other important growth drivers at Cable.\nIn particular, business services and wireless have been 2 substantial contributors to Cable's financial strength, and each still has lots of runway ahead.\nBusiness services had another strong quarter of revenue growth. And in just over a decade, we've grown this to nearly $10 billion in high-margin annual revenue, including the addition of almost $1 billion in the last 12 months alone.\nIn wireless, we added 317,000 customers this quarter and similarly, have added over $700 million in incremental revenue in the past 12 months. And we've barely scratched the surface of the opportunity here at only 8% penetration of our residential broadband customers.\nWrapping up on Cable, we are in a unique environment with some headwinds, but move activity should return to some level of normalcy, mobile substitution will eventually stabilize. And we believe fixed wireless has inherent performance and capacity limitations that sharply limit the number of people on a network using a given amount of spectrum, which should provide a natural cap on their overall industry penetration.\nMoreover, we believe that our path to deliver multi-gigabit speeds together with the other features and functionality we offer will make our broadband experience superior to any of our competitors over the long term. In the meantime, we will maintain the discipline we've always had. And I am confident that we will strike the right balance between subscriber acquisition and long-term profitability. And we all believe we have a very bright future in this business.\nMoving to NBCUniversal. We had a very strong quarter with EBITDA growth of 20% year-over-year. Our parks segment continued its momentum, generating record EBITDA for a second quarter. And this is without much contribution from Beijing, which was closed for nearly 2 months. Domestic park attendance and per caps continue to be above pre-pandemic levels. And we are moving full steam ahead in building Epic Universe. I could not be more excited for how this park will bring new experiences to our visitors and additional runway for growth.\nNBCU Media remains a very healthy business. We just completed the highest grossing upfront in our history, a testament to our content and a superb team, and the unique data and technology innovation we deliver through One Platform. This year, we secured more than $7 billion in commitments, including $1 billion at Peacock, double what we did in the 2021/ 2022 season, along with strong pricing.\nIn Studios, our success with Jurassic World, Minions and Black Phone demonstrates that great content attracts massive audiences. In addition, we are very pleased with our new film windowing, including PVOD and an accelerated Pay 1 availability on Peacock, which have expanded the audience for our films and made our studio business even more valuable.\nFor Peacock, early access to premium Universal films is a proven driver of subscriber acquisition and engagement. As we discussed during our last call, Peacock had a very strong first quarter driven by a variety of extraordinary programming, including the Super Bowl and Olympics. Given the normal ebbs and flows of our content slate, we were pleased to have stayed relatively flat for the second quarter at 27 million MAAs and 13 million paid subscribers in the U.S., in line with our expectations. And we look forward to a very strong fall when next-day broadcast becomes exclusively ours from Hulu, and we'll be able to take full advantage of our Pay 1 window with a number of big movies like Jurassic and Minions. We'll also have Sunday Night Football, Premier League, the World Cup and more originals.\nAt Sky, we are operating well in an increasingly difficult macro environment, reporting our highest ever second quarter EBITDA. We grew revenue and EBITDA in the U.K., which is our largest European market and the primary driver of our future growth.\nCalling out a couple of highlights, we are particularly pleased with the consumer response to Glass, which resulted in Sky being the third largest Ultra High-Definition television selling brand in the second quarter. And we also recorded our highest ever Premier League final day viewership, taking 30% audience share. In addition, we're seeing the benefit of our disciplined approach to sports rights in both Italy and Germany, where EBITDA also improved year-over-year.\nIn reflecting on the last 24 months, which has been wrought with uncertainty, we have performed extremely well and continue to make progress against key initiatives. Our Cable business has achieved some of the highest margins in the industry while also delivering healthy top line growth. At NBCUniversal and Sky, they have shown resilience and continue to recover despite unique challenges from the pandemic.\nTogether, we've generated nearly $30 billion in free cash flow. We're returning a record amount of capital to shareholders, and our balance sheet is in a great place. We have also continued to invest in strategically important growth opportunities, including enhancing our world-class broadband network, scaling Xfinity Mobile, increasing our capabilities at business services, launching Peacock, completing Universal Beijing and starting construction at Epic, just to name a few.\nWith substantial cash flow generation and a strong foundation for innovation, Comcast is in a wonderful position. Mike, over to you.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.\nI'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased 5.1% to $30 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $9.8 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 20% to $1.01 per share. And finally, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 3.7% to $16.6 billion. EBITDA increased 5.3% to $7.4 billion. Cable EBITDA margins improved 70 basis points year-over-year, reaching a record high margin of 44.9%, and net cash flow grew 4.4% to $5.3 billion.\nCustomer relationships are up 591,000 compared to last year and down 28,000 sequentially in the second quarter, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections given the current operating environment, partially offset by low levels of churn, which remains well below 2019 levels. We are focused on delivering an excellent customer experience and monetizing our customer relationships over their lifetime. And in that regard, EBITDA per customer relationship grew by 3% in the quarter.\nNow let's discuss Cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 3.7% was driven by broadband, business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 6.8%, reflecting an increase of 3.6% in ARPU and growth in our residential customer base compared to last year. Net residential and business customers increased by 775,000 over the past 12 months with flat results in the second quarter.\nThe trends that we saw through the second quarter have largely continued into the early parts of the third quarter with connects remaining soft, while churn is still near all-time lows. This has resulted in a quarter-to-date loss of roughly 30,000 customers.\nJuly is typically the weakest month of the quarter. And the vast majority of quarterly connect activity is weighted towards August and September, which is helped by back-to-school activity. While we're optimistic that we will have a healthy back-to-school season, short-term visibility remains low. And more importantly, beyond this temporary period, we are confident that our broadband speeds, reliability, coverage and control features continue to position us as the best-in-class product for our customers, allowing us to protect and grow our 32 million broadband customer base over time.\nBusiness services revenue increased 10% or approximately 6%, excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in average rates per customer and in our customer base, which grew by 54,000 compared to last year with 10,000 additions in the second quarter.\nMoving to wireless. Revenue increased 30% mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines compared to last year, including 317,000 lines in the quarter, which was our highest net additions for any second quarter on record.\nAdvertising revenue increased 10% mainly fueled by political revenue as well as strong growth at both our advanced advertising business, FreeWheel, and at our streaming business, Xumo, which was partially offset by a decline in our local core advertising business.\nAs a reminder, Xumo, which contributed about 20% of our advertising growth this quarter, is now part of our Charter JV and beginning in the third quarter will no longer be reported in our Cable results.\nFor video, revenue declined 2.4% driven by customer net losses totaling 1.8 million compared to last year, including 521,000 net losses in the quarter, partially offset by 7% ARPU growth due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year.\nLast, voice revenue declined 12% primarily reflecting customer losses totaling 902,000 compared to last year, including 286,000 net losses in the quarter and reflects our shift in focus to bundling broadband with wireless.\nTurning to expenses. Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 2.5%. Programming expenses decreased 1.6%, reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customers, partially offset by higher contractual rates. Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.2% driven by growth in our wireless business, expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy and an increase in bad debt as we return to more normalized levels and compare to lower levels last year. These higher costs were partially offset by a decline in customer service expenses, reflecting lower activity levels in the business as well as improvement in customer experience initiatives.\nWrapping up on Cable, we are very pleased with the 5.3% increase in EBITDA and record EBITDA margins. Even as we prioritize increasing investment in our network with CapEx intensity at nearly 11%, we generated a significant level of net cash flow. And we believe our ability to continue to generate strong and growing net cash flow out of the Cable business is sustainable.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 19% to $9.4 billion, and EBITDA increased 19.5% to $1.9 billion. Media revenue increased 3.6% to $5.3 billion driven by Peacock with revenue of $444 million, which is more than 3.5x higher compared to last year.\nDistribution revenue increased 8.4%, reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers compared to last year and growth at our networks as higher contractual rates were only partially offset by linear subscriber declines.\nAdvertising revenue decreased 1.3% due to linear rating declines and a difficult comparison to last year when we had a higher number of sporting events and NHL, which we no longer have rights to, partially offset by a growing contribution from Peacock and higher pricing. Excluding the impact of sports timing and NHL, advertising would have grown low single digits.\nMedia EBITDA decreased 2.9% to $1.3 billion in the second quarter, including a $467 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA increased nearly 4% driven by a decrease in sports costs associated with a lower number of events compared to last year and the absence of the NHL.\nWe continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year. However, taking into consideration the timing of content launches, we expect losses to be higher in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter.\nMoving next to Studios. Revenue increased 33% to $3 billion driven by higher theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue nearly tripled compared to last year's results driven by an increase in the number of releases as well as the success of these films, including the outstanding results of Jurassic World: Dominion.\nContent licensing revenue was up 19%, mainly driven by growth in TV licensing as production has returned to pre-pandemic levels. EBITDA decreased $155 million to breakeven for the quarter driven by an increase in programming and production costs associated with the higher content licensing and theatrical revenue in the current quarter as well as an increase in marketing costs ahead of several film releases in late June and in July, including the very successful release of Minions: The Rise of Gru, Black Phone and Nope.\nLast, at Theme Parks, revenue increased 65% to $1.8 billion. And we generated EBITDA of $632 million, which was a record level for any second quarter even though Universal Beijing was closed for most of the quarter due to COVID-related restrictions. These results show strong improvement compared to last year when Hollywood was operating at limited capacity and Japan was closed for part of the quarter.\nWe continued to see strong demand and EBITDA growth at our U.S. parks, where attendance and guest spending has been above 2019 levels with Orlando delivering its highest level of EBITDA for any quarter and Hollywood experiencing its best second quarter EBITDA on record. Universal Japan has shown a nice rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March with attendance having its strongest improvement since the pandemic. And we expect momentum will build over the long term.\nUniversal Beijing was closed for about 2 months and reopened at the end of June, resulting in an EBITDA loss at that park this quarter. However, this was still a financial improvement compared to the level of preopening costs we incurred in the same period last year. Since reopening the park, the trends have been positive despite capacity restrictions and testing requirements. While COVID remains a risk we must manage, particularly in Asia, we remain bullish on the parks business, both in the near and long term.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue decreased 3.5% to $4.5 billion as low single-digit growth in the U.K. was more than offset by our results in Italy and Germany, where we continued to transition through resets in our sports rights.\nDirect-to-consumer revenue decreased 2.4%, reflecting consistent average revenue per customer relationship and a decline in customer relationships compared to last year, including customer losses in the quarter of 255,000, which partially reflects normal customer churn associated with the end of the football season as well as an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment for consumers across Europe.\nDirect-to-consumer revenue in the U.K. increased low single digits in the quarter due to an increase in video revenue primarily driven by higher revenue from pubs and clubs as they recover from the pandemic as well as increases in wireless and broadband revenue. This growth in the U.K. was more than offset primarily by a decrease in revenue in Italy due to the reset in our Serie A broadcast rights.\nRounding out the rest of revenue at Sky, content revenue declined 16% driven by the reset and sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. And advertising revenue decreased 3.1% with growth in the U.K. and Germany despite the difficult macro environment more than offset by a decline in Italy.\nTurning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA increased 71% to $863 million, reflecting our strong growth in the U.K. and improved results in Germany and Italy mainly driven by lower sports programming and production costs due to resets in our sports rights.\nAs a reminder, the upcoming World Cup will take place in the fourth quarter, which is the first time this event has taken place during National League's regular season schedules. To accommodate this, national soccer leagues, including the EPL, will start the new season 1 to 2 weeks earlier in the third quarter and then take a pause for a period of 4 game weeks in the fourth quarter while the World Cup is played. As a result, compared to last year, we will incur higher sports programming amortization in the third quarter with lower levels in the fourth quarter and higher again in the first half of next year.\nNow I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter. Cash taxes of $2.75 billion included some items that drove us above the normal run rate by roughly $600 million.\nConsolidated total capital increased 12%, reflecting significant progress in building Epic Universe in Orlando, higher capital spending at Cable driven by investments in line extensions and scalable infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease at Sky. For the year, we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% as we work towards enhancing and transitioning our broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 in the next several years and NBCUniversal CapEx to be up around $1 billion year-over-year driven by the construction of Epic. Based on what we reported in the first 6 months of the year, that means total capital should be about $2.5 billion higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half.\nWorking capital was $1.7 billion for the first half of 2022 and is likely to be slightly below this amount in the second half of the year, reflecting the continued ramp in content creation and the timing of annual sports rights payments.\nTurning to capital allocation. We repurchased $3 billion worth of our shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the second quarter of $4.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x, in line with our expectations for leverage to remain around 2.4x going forward.\nSo with that, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nEVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A.\nLet me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. 2022 is off to a great start. Each of our businesses posted healthy growth in adjusted EBITDA, contributing to a double-digit increase in adjusted EPS as well as significant free cash flow generation in the quarter. And we achieved all of this while continuing to invest in our businesses for the long term, while also increasing our return of capital to shareholders.\nOur company has been at the forefront of innovation in connectivity and also in content. We have built a leading global technology platform, which today delivers 5 billion entertainment streams a week and 40 million voice commands a day across Comcast, Sky and our current syndication partners.\nYesterday's announcement highlights the value of what we've created. As you probably are aware, we formed a joint venture with Charter to offer our award-winning, voice-controlled streaming platform across the United States, starting with Flex and XClass TV, and to further develop this technology. Not only will we bring these products to millions of more customers, but we'll open the door to brand-new revenue opportunities. And when you combine Charter's footprint with our current syndication partners in both the U.S. and Canada, our retail distribution through Walmart and Sky, which essentially runs off the same technology, we now have a truly global platform.\nThis joint venture is a win-win. Consumers will get our proven world-class user and search experiences, simple content navigation and more choice in the streaming marketplace. App developers, retailers and hardware manufacturers will have access to 1 platform and 1 set of standards to quickly deploy their offerings across the U.S. And we'll be able to share in the investment and innovate alongside a partner we know well.\nComcast and Charter have a track record of coming together to bring new products and technologies to consumers. Most notably, our mobile operating partnership from 2018 enabled both companies to bring greater value and a better experience that people love. The result is a more competitive wireless marketplace, and the service that we provide has been rated #1 in customer satisfaction against all other mobile providers.\nPeacock also benefits from this joint venture as it will be deeply integrated into the platform the way it is on X1 and Flex today, which will help expand Peacock's customer base more quickly and drive higher engagement resulting in greater monetization for NBCUniversal. And we are doing all of this in the context of the investments we have already made in our technology and within the guidelines we've provided on our last earnings call, with respect to our plans for programming investment.\nSo let's come back to our achievements in the first quarter. Starting with broadband. We measured our success based on customer and financial metrics. And while we continue to compete aggressively in the current environment, we are striking what I believe to be the right balance between customer acquisition and long-term profitable growth. You can see with our first quarter results, where we added 194,000 customer relationships and 262,000 broadband subscribers. While on the financial side, Cable generated 5% revenue and 6.5% adjusted EBITDA growth, with 44% adjusted EBITDA margins.\nOur distinct competitive advantage stems from our network, which has a level of flexibility that enables fast innovation and will be further enhanced through virtualization, an important stepping stone in our ultimate evolution to DOCSIS 4.0. Our path to ubiquitous, multi-gig, symmetrical speed is well underway. And in the next several years, when you collectively include Charter and Cox, the cable industry will be positioned to offer multi-gig, symmetrical speeds to over 100 million homes throughout the United States over essentially the same DOCSIS 4.0 infrastructure. None of our competitors can say the same thing.\nFor years, we focused on not only having a modern high-capacity network, but importantly, we've also focused on providing our customers with cutting-edge technology in their homes to ensure that they have the best experience, which is a combination of fast speeds, whole home coverage, cybersecurity and control, together with fantastic streaming capabilities.\nDuring the quarter, we performed a number of successful tests on 10G equipment, and we launched our newest and most powerful xFi gateway, which increases bandwidth in the home by 3x and is the only modem that can support multi-gig symmetrical speeds to date.\nWe're also enhancing the value of Xfinity broadband by bundling with mobile, offering our customers the convenience of one relationship for all their connectivity at a tremendous value. This contributed to even further improvement in broadband retention and our best quarter ever for Xfinity Mobile in terms of line net additions.\nWe have a great wireless business, an MVNO partner in Verizon and have opportunities to further improve our economics at Xfinity Mobile longer term. For example, our testing of deploying spectrum to potentially offload wireless traffic is progressing nicely. During the quarter, we turned up our first 5G radios, and we'll be launching an employee field test in June. Stepping back, the underlying theme in all of this and the core of our strategy is that we put the customer first, which drives our strong financial results. The investments we have made and continue to make are expressly meant to enhance the experience of every person that is connected to our products and services. To that end, we just had the highest level of customer satisfaction we have ever seen for our first quarter. And we maintained our positive trend in reducing both agent handle interactions and truck rolls, which declined 19% and 17%, respectively.\nSo let's switch to NBCUniversal. We had a lot of exciting things happened during the first quarter. For the first time in our history, we aired both the Super Bowl and the Olympics in the same week, affirming our expertise in production. During that period, I went to our facility in Stanford, Connecticut. I have to say, I was so impressed by the hard work and the entire team working 24/7 around the clock, working with Beijing, while being in Connecticut, providing a seamless broadcast for the Olympics. We sent some of our equipment to China when we thought our broadcast operations would be there. And on the fly, we had to figure out new ways to air this special event and not have a consumer know that was happening. Amazing how well the team managed the complexity, delivered an unbelievably high-quality product to hundreds of millions of viewers. And I think this will help innovate sports productions for years to come.\nWe learned a lot about streaming from the last Olympics. And so when it came to Beijing, we provided a much improved experience on Peacock, which shared every single event for the first time, driving significant engagement. Really was an exceptional quarter overall for Peacock, with other big sporting events and content launches, including the Super Bowl, the debut of Bel-Air, our most successful original to date, and the day-and-date release of Marry Me. Importantly, retention on our service after airing all of this special content in such a concentrated period of time was well above our expectation. We added 4 million paid subscribers to end the first quarter with over 13 million paid subscribers and 28 million monthly active accounts in the U.S. And we've seen a 25% increase in hours of engagement year-over-year. Given the natural ebbs and flows of our content slate, we do not anticipate seeing this type of growth every quarter. We just expanded our total paid subscribers by over 40%. So we expect more modest subscriber gains until we get to the back half of this year.\nOur fourth quarter should be fantastic for sporting events such as Sunday Night Football, Premier League and the World Cup; a pay one availability of top universal titles like 'Minions: Rise of Gru and Jurassic World: Dominion; original series such as Vampire Academy; and for the first time, starting this fall, Peacock will be the exclusive home of the next-day NBC broadcast. Our streaming strategy is differentiated, unique, because Peacock is a natural extension of our existing video businesses with 2 revenue streams and full integration across every aspect, whether it's programming, cross-promotion or advertising. Peacock builds audiences, extends our reach and creates new consumer experiences within our ecosystem, which should enable video to be a major long-term growth driver for NBCUniversal.\nFinally, the business we haven't talked enough about is Theme Parks, where the recovery continues to be fantastic. I'm particularly excited about the new attractions that we opened during the pandemic, that many of our guests are now able to experience for the first time, like Super Nintendo World in Japan, the amazing VelociCoaster in Orlando; Pets in Hollywood, and of course, Universal Beijing. Our investments are significantly expanding the potential of our Theme Parks business, which will remain an important and exciting growth engine for years to come.\nSo Comcast is truly in a unique position of growing EBITDA, generating a robust level of free cash flow while making important organic investments in long-term growth initiatives, and also increasing our return of capital to shareholders, which totaled $4.2 billion this quarter through a combination of $3 billion in buybacks and $1.2 billion in dividends, the largest return of capital for any quarter in our history.\nSo off to a great start in the first quarter, and I'd like to now hand it over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $31 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $9.2 billion, adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.86 per share, and finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 4.7% to $16.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 6.5% to $7.3 billion and net cash flow grew 8.3% to $5.6 billion. We grew customer relationships by 913,000 over the past 12 months with 194,000 net additions in the first quarter. Overall, customer growth was driven by broadband, where we added 1.1 million net new residential and business customers over the past 12 months and 262,000 in the first quarter. This quarter's results reflect continued low move-related activity compared to historical levels as well as an uptick in the level of competitive activity resulting in lower connect volumes. At the same time, we continue to experience very high levels of customer retention, with this quarter's results yielding the lowest churn rate for any quarter on record. In fact, we had fewer customers disconnect this quarter than the first quarter of 2019 despite a customer base that is almost 17% larger.\nThroughout the pandemic, we have offered a variety of programs to help our customers stay connected. Some of our customers that participated received our services for free and, therefore, were not included in our subscriber totals. At year-end, we ended these COVID-related programs, triggering a benefit in the first quarter. We estimate this change accounted for about 1/3 of our first quarter net additions with such benefit contained to the first quarter.\nMoving to the financials. Cable's revenue growth of 4.7% was driven by broadband, business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 8%, driven by strong customer additions over the past 12 months and nearly 4% growth in average revenue per customer in the quarter.\nBusiness Services revenue increased 10.6% or approximately 6%, excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in both average rates per customer and in our customer base, which grew by 61,000 over the past 12 months with 9,000 additions in the first quarter.\nMoving to Wireless. Revenue increased 32%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines over the past 12 months, including 318,000 lines in the quarter, which, for the fifth consecutive quarter, was our best result since launching this business in 2017.\nAdvertising revenue increased 8.6%, reflecting higher political and double-digit growth in Zumo and advanced advertising. For video, revenue declined 1.5%, driven by customer net losses totaling $1.7 million over the past 12 months, including $512,000 in the quarter, partially offset by higher average revenue per customer due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year.\nLast, voice revenue declined 9.8%, primarily reflecting customer losses totaling 725,000 over the past 12 months, including 282,000 net losses in the quarter and reflects our shift to more converged broadband mobile offers.\nTurning to expenses. Cable Communications' first quarter expenses increased 3.3%. Programming expenses decreased 1.1%, reflecting a decline in video customers, partially offset by higher rates. Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.3%, reflecting investments in our growth businesses, including Broadband, Wireless and Business Services; expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy; as well as an increase in other expenses, primarily due to bad debt returning to more normalized levels. These higher costs were partially offset by a decline in customer service expenses, reflecting lower activity levels in the business as well as improvement in customer experience initiatives.\nCable Communications' EBITDA increased 6.5% to $7.3 billion for the quarter and Cable EBITDA margin reached 44%, reflecting 80 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We believe we are striking the right balance by continuing to invest in our growth businesses, which are driving the top line and proving to be a great return for us, while at the same time, continuing to increase our operating efficiency and remove unnecessary costs.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue increased 47% to $10.3 billion and EBITDA increased 7.4% to $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 36% to $6.9 billion, including Peacock revenue, which grew more than 5x year-over-year to $472 million in the quarter. As Brian noted earlier, we aired both the Olympics and Super Bowl, which together contributed an incremental $1.5 billion to Media revenue. Excluding these events, Media revenue increased 6.9%, driven by both higher distribution and advertising revenue.\nDistribution revenue, excluding the contribution from the Olympics, increased 8.5%, reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers as well as our networks, reflecting higher contractual rates, partially offset by linear subscriber declines. Advertising revenue, excluding contributions from the Olympics and Super Bowl, increased 4%, reflecting higher pricing and a growing contribution from Peacock, which was partially offset by linear ratings declines.\nMedia EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.2 billion in the first quarter, including a $456 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA decreased 7.7%, reflecting higher programming and production costs associated with our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl as well as higher costs driven by the return of our full primetime schedule compared to last year when our schedule was impacted by COVID-19. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year. However, taking into consideration the timing of content launches, consistent with what Brian mentioned, we would expect losses to be higher in the second half of the year.\nMoving next to Studios. Revenues increased 15% to $2.8 billion, driven by higher content licensing and theatrical revenue, but EBITDA declined 51% to $245 million. The decline in EBITDA primarily reflects a difficult comparison to last year's first quarter, which benefited from a licensing deal with Peacock, including exclusive streaming rights for The Office, with an offsetting adjustment reflected in NBCUniversal's eliminations. The remainder of the EBITDA decline reflects higher marketing costs ahead of numerous film releases planned for the second quarter, including Jurassic World: Dominion, Ambulance and Bad Guys.\nLast, at Theme Parks, revenue increased by $941 million to $1.6 billion, and we generated EBITDA of $451 million, reflecting improved results at each of our parks compared to last year when Orlando and Japan were operating at limited capacity and Hollywood was closed due to COVID-19. We continue to see exceptional demand at our domestic parks, attendance was back to prepandemic levels, and we had strong growth in per caps, with Orlando generating its highest EBITDA on record for our first quarter.\nCOVID impacts in the quarter were more pronounced internationally. Universal Studios Japan's results were impacted by capacity restrictions, which were in place for most of the first quarter. These restrictions were lifted at the end of March. And over the last month, we have seen a very strong rebound with attendance currently above prepandemic levels. At Universal Beijing, which opened in September of last year, demand from our guests was high, but overall attendance was impacted by COVID and related travel restrictions. Despite that, Beijing only contributed a slight EBITDA loss in the quarter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue of $4.8 billion was consistent with the same period last year as solid growth in the U.K. was offset by our results in Italy, where we continue to transition through the reset in our Syria broadcast rights, which we won't begin to lap until the back half of this year. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent year-over-year, reflecting growth in the U.K., where we continue to have healthy customer additions and grew direct-to-consumer revenue by mid-single digits, driven by an increase in video revenue, including higher revenue from pubs and clubs, streaming and premium TV as well as healthy increases in broadband and wireless revenue.\nThis growth in the U.K. was mainly offset by lower revenue in Italy, where we continue to experience both customer losses and lower direct-to-consumer revenue, primarily due to the reset in our Syria broadcast rights. Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky. Content revenue declined 14%, driven by the reset and sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. And advertising revenue increased 7.9% with healthy growth in the U.K., partially offset by a decline in Italy.\nTurning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA increased 71% to $622 million driven by our strong performance in the U.K. and improved results in Italy and Germany, where we benefited from lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights.\nNext, I'll discuss free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $4.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter. Consolidated total capital increased 1.1%, reflecting increases at NBCU due to ramping construction at Epic Universe, a decrease at Sky and a relatively flat capital spending at Cable due to timing. For the year, we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% as we increase investment in our broadband network. And NBCUniversal CapEx related to the construction of EPIC universe to be up around $1 billion year-over-year.\nTurning to capital allocation. As of today, we have repurchased $4 billion worth of our shares year-to-date, including $3 billion in the first quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the first quarter of $4.2 billion.\nAnd before I wrap up, I also want to spend a minute on the macro environment since inflation and interest rates are topical right now. There are certain areas of expense across each of our businesses that are impacted by inflation. Like other companies in our space, we're not entirely insulated from that. However, the overall impact to our financials has been limited. Overall energy costs make up about 1% of our total company's operating expenses. Also, we are more than offsetting any pressure on wages and other areas of expense through the continuing efforts to implement operational efficiencies, helping us protect the healthy margins across our businesses.\nLastly, our balance sheet is very well-positioned with about 95% of our debt based on fixed rates, a debt portfolio with a weighted average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.47%. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x and still expect to remain around 2.4x leverage going forward.\nSo with that, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nSVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A.\nLet me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\n\nBrian L. Roberts\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We just reported a strong fourth quarter to end a year that hit a number of important financial milestones. In 2021, we generated record high revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow with contributions coming from across the company. These results reflect our resilience, strategic decision-making and disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is driven by a relentless focus on growth and creating long-term value.\nI am incredibly proud of how we've navigated through the past 2 years amid the unique and ongoing challenges posed by the global pandemic. We've been able to quickly pivot when necessary in order to continue offering world-class connectivity, entertainment and experiences while simultaneously prioritizing the health and well-being of our customers, guests and employees.\nSo now turning to the specifics. Our broadband-centric businesses, residential, business services and wireless, helped drive 11% adjusted EBITDA growth and 190 basis points of organic margin expansion in Cable. And while the quarterly cadence may have come in differently than we expected, we added 1.1 million customer relationships and 1.3 million net broadband subscribers, bringing total customer relationships to 34.2 million and total broadband subscribers to 31.9 million as of year-end.\nIn wireless, our unique and recently enhanced relationship with Verizon enabled us to bring a more competitive offering for our wireless customers. That also improved the economics for us, resulting in our largest annual growth in wireless lines yet while reaching profitability on a stand-alone basis for the first time since launch.\nThe recovery to our Theme Parks is truly remarkable. We just reported the most profitable fourth quarter on record with demand especially high in Orlando, which had the best quarter in the company's history for any quarter. I'm even more excited for our newest theme park, Epic Universe, which is in construction as we speak. Hollywood and Osaka are also on a great trajectory, and we just opened Universal Beijing, which will provide a more meaningful contribution in the years to come.\nWe also accomplished a lot on the content side. We are back to normalized levels of programming and production at both NBCU and Sky. We successfully renewed a number of sports rights agreements, including the NFL, Bundesliga, PGA Tour, Premier League and others, which provides us great visibility for the next several years. And we're monetizing IP through creative new windows. I'll share more detail on Peacock in a bit, but 2021 was a fantastic year for our fast-growing streaming service, which has outperformed our high expectations.\nAt Sky, our U.K. businesses maintained wonderful momentum with very strong trends across all metrics, including customer relationships, ARPU and churn and fueling Sky's full year EBITDA growth of 10%. Germany is showing signs of a successful recovery. And in Italy, we're managing the impact of the transition in our sports rights even better than we had expected.\nFinally, on 2021, I'd like to highlight the strength of our balance sheet and the increase in the amount of capital we returned to shareholders. We hit our leverage goals a bit earlier than we had anticipated during the pandemic, which enabled us to repurchase $4 billion of stock, the majority completed in the back half of the year. And including our dividend, we returned a total of $8.5 billion, more than double that of 2020.\nNow let me discuss our priorities for 2022. First is broadband, which is a healthy, scaled business with a structurally advantageous financial profile defined by high operating leverage and margin accretion. We believe that the broadband market conditions in 2022 will continue to be impacted by COVID. And within this environment, we will strike the right balance between subscriber acquisition against a large and expanding addressable market as well as long-term profitable growth.\nOn that front, we will evaluate every opportunity to increase our serviceable passings even more so than we have in the past. We will take advantage of the natural progression of new household and business formation as well as the potential subsidies from the federal, state and local governments to expand into unserved areas. We also aggressively compete for market share through our strategy of bundling products around broadband so that every customer in every segment has plenty of choice at the right price. Convergence with Xfinity Mobile will play a big role in terms of marketing, how our sales force operates, packaging and the overall interface we have with our customers. Scaling this business is a key focus for us in '22 and beyond.\nAnd we will do everything we can to continue to improve the experience for our customers and maintain the high levels of retention that started well before the pandemic. Our AI technologies and digital service tools enable us to resolve issues without a call or visit. In fact, this past quarter, total calls handled by our agents decreased 18% year-over-year, and truck rolls declined by 16% while we continue to grow our customer base and increase our NPS scores.\nBroadband connectivity has never been as important as it is now to all of us, and people increasingly expect more than just speed. They also want innovative products that are easy to use and consistent and reliable service throughout their home. That's what we deliver.\nWe have an incredible network, but what differentiates us even more is the ecosystem we've built around this network. We've spent the last several years developing the right processes, finding the right technology and hiring the right people so that we can execute at great scale.\nI'll share a couple of tangible examples that illustrate this. We are moving aggressively on a path to 10G while maintaining our level of CapEx intensity. It's still early, but we already are out in the marketplace with our new technology and higher upload speeds in some of the markets. And we will continue to expand this in 2022 and beyond.\nWe also just launched the first WiFi 6E gateway, truly the first DOCSIS 4.0 device with the capability of delivering multi-gigabit speed. Our goal is to continue to innovate on top of this and further widen the gap between the in-home experience that we offer versus any of the competition.\nPriority #2 is Peacock. Premium video consumption continues to increase across the industry, currently approaching 600 billion hours per year in the U.S., up from 350 billion hours annually in the broadcast-led era of the early 1990s. We've also seen that the average household spend on video continues to grow by over 10% since 2014 alone, which is constantly expanding the addressable market.\nNBCUniversal has played a significant part in this ecosystem, ranking as the #1 TV portfolio audience and #2 film business in box office with incredible engagement. Today, NBCU reaches over 100 million U.S. households, which is nearly 80% of the population every quarter. Of that 100 million, Nielsen reports that nearly 60 million households watch at least 10 hours of our content every single month. That's more households than our competitors in both linear TV and streaming.\nWhen we introduced Peacock back in early 2020, our vision was to launch a streaming service that offers premium content and is supported primarily by advertising. What we've learned so far is that we started with the right business model. With over 300 million hours of content consumed on Peacock per month, the engagement with our platform has proven extremely valuable to advertisers.\nWe also realized the importance of diversity when it comes to genres, and so we added sports. We introduced early access movies, and we started ramping up some originals. Behind these investments, we found ourselves well on our way to exceeding the MAA and revenue targets we initially discussed.\nIn fact, at the end of 2021, we had 24.5 million monthly active accounts in the U.S. or about 75% of the guidance we have provided for 2024. Within these 24.5 million MAAs are over 9 million paid subscribers approaching $10 in paid ARPU, which includes the advertising, and that is without much focus on paid subscriber growth.\nWe have another 7 million highly engaged bundled subscribers from Xfinity and other top distributors who use Peacock every single month and currently receive Peacock Premium at no extra cost. We expect strong conversion of this group to paid subscribers over time.\nWe've accomplished all of this despite our movies and NBC content still premiering on other streaming services through the end of 2021, including HBO and Hulu and with the majority of our best content still to come. We just started including the NFL, our Pay-One movie deal kicks in this year, and we have a growing number of originals in the pipeline.\nOur research indicates that 80% of consumers prefer an ad-supported service over a higher-cost, ad-free SVOD offering. We see this in our customer mix with the vast majority of our paid subscribers choosing the $5 paid AVOD tier over the $10 tier without ads. You combine this with the fact that our paid subscribers have much lower churn and significantly higher engagement.\nAnd we think the most valuable end state for Peacock is to have 2 revenue streams. And so while we will continue to leverage the more than $20 billion of programming spend we already have across NBCU and Sky, we are committed to reallocating and increasing investment on top of this to drive further growth in paid subscribers, which we believe is the right path to creating long-term value.\nI couldn't be more excited about the momentum we are seeing with Peacock in the U.S. as well as the international opportunities ahead. In late 2021, we introduced Peacock on Sky in the U.K. and Ireland that earlier this week, we announced the rollout of Germany and Austria and plans are in place for our own Sky Showtime joint venture to launch later this year.\nNext, our company's third priority for 2022 is to monetize and expand the reach of our proprietary global technology platform and our addressable customer base. In October, we launched Sky Glass in the U.K. and XClass in the U.S., both built upon our investments in X1, Flex and Sky Q. This year, we'll continue to evolve this strategy to incorporate more markets, additional partners and new distribution outlets. I look forward to updating you on our progress.\nOur fourth priority is to continue to have a positive impact on society and the communities we serve. A big part of that work is our commitment to DE&I and digital equity. A decade ago, we created Internet Essentials, which has become the nation's largest low-income broadband adoption program. And we have recently expanded our efforts with the launch of Lift Zones, where we brought free WiFi to more than 1,000 community centers around the country.\nThese are just 2 examples of how our teams have come together to help connect more people to the tools and resources they need to succeed in a digital world. So I am really proud of our many accomplishments in 2021 and extremely optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for our company.\nI firmly believe that our integrated strategy with the assets, capabilities and talent we have today will continue to drive growth across our businesses and create long-term shareholder value. Mike?\n\nMichael J. Cavanagh\n\nCFO, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated 2021 financial results. Revenue increased 9.5% to $30.3 billion for the fourth quarter and 12% to $116.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $8.4 billion for the fourth quarter and 13% to $34.7 billion for the full year. Adjusted EPS increased 38% to $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter and 24% to $3.23 for the full year.\nAnd we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $17.1 billion for the year on a reported basis, which includes a $1.3 billion benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August, $620 million of which fell in the fourth quarter as well as roughly $1 billion from returns on investing activities, most of which occurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, free cash flow was $14.8 billion for the year.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 4.5% to $16.4 billion. EBITDA increased 7.8% to $7.1 billion, and net cash flow grew 9.2% to $4.5 billion.\nFor the full year, we grew customer relationships by 1.1 million with 169,000 net additions in the fourth quarter. Overall, customer growth continues to be driven by broadband, where we added 1.3 million net new residential and business customers for the year and 212,000 in the fourth quarter.\nOur net adds this quarter reflect the continuation of lower overall marketplace activity, particularly move activity, compared to historical trends. While this resulted in lower connect volumes, it also contributed to high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any fourth quarter on record. Broadband was also the largest contributor to our Cable revenue growth with broadband revenue increasing 8.5% in the quarter driven by the strong net additions over the past year as well as healthy growth in average revenue per customer.\nMoving to wireless. Revenue increased 40% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines for the year and 312,000 lines in the quarter, the best results since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 4 million.\nAs Brian noted, over the past year, we have made tremendous strides fully integrating wireless into our core Cable operations, achieving stand-alone profitability of $157 million this year. Now that we've crossed strongly into profitability and the business is deeply integrated into our core Cable operations, we won't be disclosing stand-alone wireless EBITDA going forward.\nBusiness services revenue increased 11.5% or approximately 7% excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our strong organic results were driven by customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products and rate increases on some of our services as well as the continued growth in our customer base, which grew by 63,000 net new customers over the past year with 17,000 additions in the fourth quarter.\nFor video, revenue declined 1.2% driven by customer net losses totaling 1.7 million over the past year, including 373,000 in the fourth quarter, partially offset by higher average revenue per customer. This higher revenue per customer was driven by the residential rate adjustment we implemented at the beginning of 2021, which we believe was also a driver of video subscriber losses. We implemented a similar rate increase earlier this month, so we expect this trend to continue throughout 2022.\nLast, advertising revenue decreased 12.5%, reflecting lower political advertising compared to record levels in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding political, advertising was up 9% with modest growth in core and double-digit growth in advanced advertising.\nTurning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2%. Programming expenses decreased 1.2%, reflecting a decline in video customers, partially offset by higher rates. As we enter 2022, programming expenses should reflect the benefit of fewer contract renewals combined with the impact from our anticipated decline in overall video customers.\nNonprogramming expenses increased 4.1% and were flat on a per relationship basis, reflecting investment to drive organic growth in the business as well as the expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy. The primary driver of the year-over-year change was technical and product support, which increased about 10%, largely related to growth in our wireless business and was partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense.\nCable Communications EBITDA increased 7.8% to $7.1 billion for the fourth quarter. And Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.4%, reflecting 130 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We believe we are striking the right balance by continuing to invest in our growth businesses, which are driving the top line and proving to be a great return for us, while at the same time, continuing to increase our operating efficiency and take unnecessary costs out of the business. All of this together should enable us to drive higher profitability and expand margins, both in 2022 and thereafter.\nCable capital expenditures increased 3.7% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.8%, our lowest full year on record and essentially in line with 2020's 11% driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions. As we noted on our call in July, we expect our Cable CapEx intensity will remain around 11% for the next few years as we continue to increase the number of homes and businesses that we pass and accelerate our investment in the technology that will enhance the overall capacity of our network, both downstream and upstream. This is a direct step to DOCSIS 4.0, which allows for multi-gig symmetrical speeds essentially with a software update, providing very little to no disruption to the home in a very capital-efficient way.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 26% to $9.3 billion, and EBITDA decreased 6.8% to $1.3 billion. Media revenue increased 8.4% to $5.8 billion driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue with a significant contribution from Peacock.\nDistribution revenue increased 12%, reflecting higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020 and a growing contribution from Peacock due to our growth in paid subscribers, partially offset by subscriber declines at our networks. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will lap these carriage renewals.\nAdvertising revenue increased 6%, reflecting higher pricing, which benefited from our strong upfront and a growing contribution from Peacock, which was only partially offset by ratings declines and a difficult comparison to record levels of political advertising at our local stations in last year's fourth quarter.\nMedia EBITDA decreased 49% to $721 million in the fourth quarter, including a $559 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA decreased 24%, reflecting higher costs associated with more sporting events at our regional sports networks compared to last year when the NBA and NHL delayed the start of their seasons due to COVID-19 as well as higher television programming and marketing costs driven by the return of our full schedule compared to last year when our schedule was impacted by COVID-19. This difficult cost comparison will continue in the first quarter.\nBefore moving on, I want to build on Brian's comments regarding Peacock. In 2021, Peacock generated revenue of nearly $800 million and an EBITDA loss of $1.7 billion, which includes content spend of over $1.5 billion.\nEven with a relatively limited programming slate, we've achieved a level of success in MAAs, paid subs and engagement that is driving our decision to double our content spend on Peacock in 2022 to over $3 billion with the goal of ramping domestic content spend to $5 billion over the next couple of years, some of which will be incremental, and some of which will be a reallocation from linear programming. For 2022, while we expect a significant step-up in revenue, the incremental investment we are spending in both content and marketing and service will likely result in an EBITDA loss of roughly $2.5 billion.\nWhile the timing of when Peacock breaks even may be pushed out from where we originally expected, we believe pursuing a dual revenue stream is the right strategy to create long-term value. And given the strength in our Theme Parks and high-margin linear businesses, the good news is that we will fund this pivot out of NBCUniversal's cash flows.\nMoving next to Studios. Revenue increased 36% to $2.4 billion, but EBITDA declined 34% to $51 million. This decline was driven by the timing of our film slate, partially offset by growth in TV content licensing.\nFilm has a multiyear business model, with titles monetized over time as they transition through different theatrical and licensing windows. As a result of pausing film releases in 2020 during the pandemic, we had fewer new titles come into the licensing window in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. And at the same time, marketing costs were higher as we released Sing 2 and Halloween Kills in theaters. This impact of fewer carryover titles and higher year-over-year marketing costs associated with more theatrical releases will begin to diminish as we move forward but will continue to pressure EBITDA growth for the next few quarters.\nLast, at Theme Parks, revenue increased by $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion. And we generated EBITDA of $674 million, which was our highest on record for any fourth quarter driven by strong momentum in the U.S. and Japan.\nAt our U.S. parks, we benefited from strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above pre-pandemic levels. At Universal Studios Japan, we saw improved attendance levels as government-mandated capacity restrictions were eased during the quarter.\nAt our newly opened park, Universal Beijing, we are pleased with our first full quarter of operations where the level of demand from our guests was high, but overall attendance was impacted by COVID-related restrictions. Despite that, Beijing's EBITDA was essentially breakeven in the quarter, and we anticipate modest profitability in our first full year of operation in 2022.\nFor total Theme Parks, while we have been very pleased with the pace of our recovery, particularly in the U.S., we recognize that the business is subject to variability related to the pandemic, which tends to be more pronounced at our international parks.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue decreased 2.5% to $5.1 billion as solid growth in the U.K. was offset by our results in Italy, where we continue to transition through the change to our Serie A broadcast rates.\nDirect-to-consumer revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a modest decline in average revenue per customer relationship and overall customer relationship additions of 61,000 in the fourth quarter. This gain mostly came from a meaningful increase in streaming subscribers primarily driven by seasonally strong entertainment content as well as a widely viewed sports schedule. The higher level of streaming additions in the quarter more than offset the level of customer losses we experienced in Italy, which were also better than we had anticipated.\nIn the U.K., direct-to-consumer revenue increased mid-single digits driven by continued healthy customer additions, supported by record low churn and higher average revenue per customer. Revenue growth benefited from growth in broadband and wireless, streaming and hospitality as pubs and clubs revenue has recovered back to 2019 levels. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and average revenue per customer in Italy, both mainly due to the change in our Serie A broadcast rights.\nRounding out the rest of revenue, content revenue declined 23% driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. And advertising revenue increased 1% with healthy growth in the U.K. and Germany, mostly offset by a decline in Italy.\nTurning to our EBITDA results. Sky's EBITDA increased 188% to $464 million driven by our strong performance in the U.K. and improvements in Germany and Italy. Overall, the results reflect lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights, partially offset by a change in sports rights amortization, which resulted in an increase of $130 million.\nAs a reminder, we announced this change last quarter. It did not impact our full year results, but it does impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs with expenses higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters.\nI'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2021, we generated around $15 billion in organic free cash flow, excluding the items I referred to earlier. Consolidated total capital increased 3.6% to $12.1 billion largely driven by higher investment on our broadband network.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% and NBCUniversal CapEx related to the construction of Epic Universe to be up around $1 billion. Working capital was $1.5 billion for the year, a $1.3 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in studio content and our broadcast of the Summer Olympics but less than we originally expected largely due to the timing of content spend at both NBCUniversal and Sky and a faster-than-expected recovery of Theme Parks.\nTurning to capital allocation. We ended the year with net leverage at 2.4x and returned a total of $8.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in dividend payments and $4 billion in share repurchases. For 2022, as I said previously, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns.\nAs we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 to $1.08 per share, our 14th consecutive annual increase. And our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. This capital allocation policy will allow us to maintain the balance we've talked about, investing organically in the businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders.\nSo thanks for joining us on the call this morning. With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\n\nMarci Ryvicker\n\nSVP of IR, Comcast Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.",

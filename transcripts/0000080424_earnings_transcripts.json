Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.\nAs required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends. and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I will start with an overview of results for the first quarter of fiscal '26 and spend a few [indiscernible] environment. This marks 40 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth and keeps us on track for the tenth consecutive fiscal year of core EPS growth. Organic sales rounded up to 2%. Volume was in line with prior year. Pricing and mix were each up 1%.\nGrowth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions, with 8 of 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Skin & Personal Care led the growth, up high single digits. Hair Care, Grooming, Personal Health Care, Home Care and Baby Care each grew low singles. Oral Care and Feminine Care were in line with prior year, and Fabric Care and Family Care were each down low single digits. 6 of 7 regions held or grew organic sales. Focus markets were up more than 1%. Organic sales in North America were up 1%. Consumption in our categories decelerated throughout the quarter, with unit volumes essentially flat for both markets and P&G brands.\nPrice mix added a point of growth. The pricing for innovation and supply chain costs that was announced on June 15 went into effect on September 15. This caused some trade inventory volatility in the quarter, but shipments were largely in line with offtake for the full quarter. European focus markets organic sales were equal to prior year with strong growth in France and Spain, offset by a softer period in Germany and Italy. Greater China organic sales grew 5%, another quarter of sequential improvement and positive momentum. 6 of 7 categories grew organic sales in quarter 1 with Pampers and SK-II each growing double digits. This progress is the result of interventions made across the digital commerce and distributor business, along with strong innovation and execution of the integrated strategy.\nEnterprise markets grew more than 1% for the quarter. Latin America organic sales were up 7% and with strong growth across Mexico, Brazil and the balance of smaller markets in the region. Organic sales in the European enterprise region were in line with prior year and the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa enterprise region was down low singles. Global aggregate market share was down 30 basis points, 24 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.99, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS also increased 3%.\nCore gross margin was down 50 basis points and core operating margin was equal to prior year. Strong productivity improvement of 230 basis points with healthy reinvestment in innovation and demand creation. Currency-neutral core operating margin was up 40 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 102%, a very strong Q1 results. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareowners this quarter, EUR 2.55 billion in dividends and EUR 1.25 billion in share repurchases. In summary, a solid quarter to start the year in what continues to be a challenging environment, including heightened competitive activity in the U.S. and in Europe.\nMoving on to strategy. Given the market and competitive challenges we face now is the time for increased investment in and flawless execution of our integrated growth strategy consumer firmly at the center of everything we do. We will drive superiority in every part of our portfolio across all value tiers where we play, all retail channels and all consumer segments we serve to grow categories, provide value to consumers and customers and create value for shareowners.\nWe will strengthen the integration of all vectors of superiority starting with a very strong innovation program this year, building stronger core brand propositions and growing bigger adjacencies and forms to enhance consumer delight, core and more. In U.S. Fabric Care, we recently started shipments of Tide's biggest upgrade to liquid detergent in 20 years. Tide's boosted formula combines its ultimate grease and stain fighting technology with an advanced perfume innovation, resulting in laundry that's cleaner, wider, brighter and fresher.\nThe significant innovation on liquid detergent strengthens the core of the Tide franchise as we continue plans for expansion of Tide evo, our new laundry detergent developed on our breakthrough Functional fibers platform. evo has started its first stage of national expansion with an online launch of Tide evo free and gentle. evo offers superior cleaning performance in a recyclable package, no plastic bottles or water. In test market stores, evo sales have been highly incremental to category growth and retailer demand has been well above initial expectations. We're in the process of adding manufacturing capacity to prepare for an eventual national launch.\nWe have a strong bundle of innovation launching across U.S. the U.S. Baby Care business this fall, including improvements on tempers, easy ups, Swaddlers, cruisers, and the first phase of restage to our mid-tier Pampers Baby dry line. Each are important upgrades to drive consumer trial and delight, especially considering the ramp-up in competitive promotional activity in the category.\nIn Greater China, premium body wash innovation on both the Safeguard and delayed brands drove 9% Personal Care growth in the quarter. Safeguard detox body wash is designed to provide superior deep for cleansing and skin transformation. The recent restage across all elements of the superiority has accelerated market conversion from bars to liquids and from basic products to premium offerings. Olay premium body wash launched in July, contains Olay facial skin essence and the first ever sparkling liquid to provide visible skin benefits and an unforgettable showering experience. Since launch, the new premium line has grown over 30% in off-line channels and 80% online driving category growth and Olay share growth.\nIn Latin America, Personal Healthcare grew organic sales plus 15% in quarter 1, driven by improved execution of the integrated superiority strategy. The combination of strong product and packaging innovation on the BIC brand compelling consumer communication, strong retail execution and superior consumer value drove both growth across markets and the region. Brazil led the growth up nearly 30%, along with growth in Mexico, Peru, Colombia and smaller distributor markets.\nOur innovation program is designed to strengthen the core brand propositions combined with full media and in-store support across the portfolio. where we add new elements to our brands, like we are doing with Tide evo, we ensure the more is sufficient in size to warrant full brand communication and go-to-market support. Superiority integrated across all 5 vectors. We will continue to accelerate productivity in all areas of our operation, including the recently announced restructuring work to fuel investments in superiority, mitigate cost and currency headwinds and drive margin expansion.\nWe have an objective for growth savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories with Supply Chain 3.0. We have line of sight to savings for improved marketing productivity, more efficiency, greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations.\nVisibility to more savings opportunities is increasing as the businesses continue to build their 3-year rolling productivity master plans and as we accelerate productivity with our restructuring efforts. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio across markets and brands to strengthen our ability to generate U.S. dollar-based returns in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio choices we are making as part of the restructuring program include different go-to-market choices in some geographies and surgical exits of some categories, brands and product forms in individual markets.\nWe've announced several steps so far, redesigning our business model in Pakistan to an import model with local distributors managing trade relationships, is continuing laundry detergent bars in India and the Philippines, exiting several low-tier oral care products in some enterprise markets, focusing the Olay brand on the most productive European markets, and streamlining our brown device portfolio and focus and enterprise markets. These steps are aimed at accelerating growth as we move further through the restructuring program. Also, these portfolio moves enable us to make related interventions in our supply chain, rightsizing right-locating production to drive efficiencies, faster innovation, cost reduction and even more reliable and resilient supply.\nAs part of the 2-year program, we are making additional organization process and technology changes to enable an even more agile, empowered and accountable organization, making roles broader, team smaller and faster and work more fulfilling and more efficient, actively reducing, eliminating or automating internal work processes, supporting teams with data and technology to increase capacity and capability to focus on integrated plans to deliver superior propositions to our consumers versus spending time internally.\nWe expect to reduce up to 7,000 nonmanufacturing roles or up to 15% of our current nonmanufacturing workforce over this fiscal year and fiscal '27. We're making very good progress with organization designs to deliver this objective. While not easy, we firmly believe this will further empower our highly capable and agile organization that is ready to step forward to create value for our consumers, customers and shareowners. We will continue our efforts to constructively disrupt ourselves our industry changing, adapting, creating new ideas, technologies and capabilities that will extend our competitive advantage.\nThese strategic choices across portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and our organization will continue to reinforce and build on each other. We remain confident in our strategy and its importance, especially in challenging times to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth and value creation.\nLong-term focus on the strength of our brands and categories is the best way to position ourselves for stronger growth when the economic climate and consumer confidence improves. This starts with a strong innovation plan and healthy investment to drive trial and user growth, the plan we are executing. As we said in the July earnings call, there are times when bigger steps are needed to both the growth and value creation. The teams are on it.\nMoving on to guidance for fiscal 2026. As you saw in our press release this morning, we're maintaining all guidance ranges for the fiscal year. Organic sales growth of in line to plus 4% and Global market growth for our portfolio footprint is around 2% on a value basis at the center of our guidance range. As a reminder, this guidance includes a 30 to 50 basis point headwind from product and market exits that are part of restructuring work. As we consider phasing of top line growth, recall that Q2 last year benefited from 2 spikes in orders related to port strikes. The actual port strike that took place early October and the concern of another strike in January, these dynamics will likely result in quarter 2 this year being the softest growth quarter for the year with stronger growth in the back half.\nOn the bottom line, core EPS growth, in line to plus 4%, which equates to a range of $6.83 to $7.09 per share or $6.96, up 2% in the center of the range. While we delivered strong EPS growth in quarter 1, we expect modest earnings growth over the balance of the year as investments in innovation and competitiveness increase, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe. This outlook includes a commodity cost headwind of approximately $100 million after tax and a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $300 million after tax.\nOur fiscal '26 outlook now includes approximately $500 million before tax and higher costs from tariffs. While this is an improvement to the isolated tariff impact. Keep in mind that these -- that there are other offsetting impacts, including related supply chain investments and adjustments to pricing plans also assumed in our guidance.\nBelow the operating line, we continue to expect modestly higher interest expense versus last fiscal year and a core effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 21% for fiscal '26 combined a $250 million after-tax headwind to earnings growth. We are forecasting adjusted free cash flow productivity in the range of 85% to 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories, and as we incur the cash cost from the restructuring work.\nWe expect to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase approximately $5 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return roughly $15 billion of cash to shareowners in fiscal '26. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity or other cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges.\nSo again, a solid start to the year, growing sales and earnings and returning strong levels of cash to shareowners as we look to strengthen investments in demand creation throughout the balance of the fiscal year. We continue to believe the best path to sustainable balance growth is to double down on the strategy, excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. We are taking proactive steps to improve the execution of the strategy and our ability to deliver our growth and value-creation objectives.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10K, 10Q, and 8K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections as required by Regulation G.\nProcter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJon Moeller here. I'm going to start the call and then I will hand it over to Andre. Good morning. Obviously Andre Schulten is joining me here as is Jon Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Last evening we announced that after 38 years of service, I will transition into the role of Executive Chairman of the Board beginning 1 January 2026, and that the Board of Directors has elected Shailesh Jejurikar as the incoming President and Chief Executive Officer. This move has been thoughtfully planned and provides P&G with highly capable and experienced leadership going forward.\nShailesh has a distinguished track record throughout his 36-year P&G career and has been an integral part of P&G's leadership team for the past 12 years. He's delivered substantial contributions across multiple businesses in both focus and enterprise markets, including regional and global leadership of our fabric and home care categories. Most recently, Shailesh served as Chief Operating Officer with P&L ownership for our Enterprise Markets business along with the management responsibilities for our product supply. Market operations, global business services, and IT organizations.\nOver the last 17 years as CFO, COO, and CFO, COO, and CEO. I've had the benefit of working closely with Shailesh and our outstanding global leadership team to develop an integrated, comprehensive set of strategies to guide our choices and priorities. Those strategies continue to serve us well. Andre has been a partner in advocating for a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and the need for P&G brands to lead the growth of our markets. Growing markets versus simply taking business to build market share. These fundamentals guide our decision making as we execute our integrated growth strategy.\nAnd drive value creation for shareowners. For my part, it's been a tremendous honor to serve as P&G's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. As I've walked the halls of P&G buildings around the world. For the last 38 years, I'm constantly reminded of the privilege it is to work alongside such committed colleagues and friends. P&G has afforded me the chance to serve consumers and communities around the world. It's been a true joy and a tremendous learning experience. Our strategy is working, our bench is strong. As we cross the calendar year.\nIt's a good time to transition to the next generation to lead the P&G team through its next chapter of top and bottom line growth and, of course, value creation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to another esteemed colleague, Andre Schulten, to lead us through fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter and the year end results.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThank you, Jon, and congratulations to you and to Shailesh, and I'm very happy you will be in the current position for the next six months and Executive Chairman thereafter. So with that, I'll start with an overview of results for fiscal 25 and then the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on strategic focus areas and capabilities, and we will close with guidance for fiscal 26 and then take your questions.\nExecution of our integrated strategy enabled the company to grow Organic sales and Core EPS and to return cash to share owners in line with our target range in a challenging fiscal 25. Despite volatile macroeconomic, geopolitical, and consumer dynamics resulting in market level headwinds that were not anticipated at the start of the fiscal year, Organic sales for the year grew 2%, volume growth contributed 1 point, and price mix added 1 point.\nGrowth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions. Nine of 10 product categories grew. Organic sales for the year. Family care and personal health care each grew mid-singles. Fabric care, home care, feminine care, hair care, grooming, oral care, and skin and personal care were up low single digits. Baby care was down low singles.\nFocus markets grew organic sales 2% for the year, with North America up 2% and Europe Focus markets up 3%. Greater China organic sales were down 5% versus the prior year, but improved sequentially throughout the fiscal year, growing 2% in the most recent quarter. Enterprise markets were up 2%, led by Latin America with 4% organic sales growth. E-commerce sales increased 12%, now representing 19% of total company.\n30 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Seven of 10 product categories held or grew share globally. In aggregate, global value and volume share were both in line versus prior year. All-channel market value in the US categories in which we compete grew around 3.5% in fiscal 2025 P&G. Consumption growth was roughly in line with category value and volume levels for the year.\nCore earnings per share were $6.83, up 4% for the year. Core growth margin declined 40 basis points, and core operating margin increased 50 basis points. Nearly $2.7 billion of productivity improvement across cost of goods sold at SGA enabled an increase in investment in superior products and packages and brand communication to drive market growth.\nOn a currency neutral basis, core EPS was up 4%, and core operating margin increased 50 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 87%. We increased our dividend by 5% and returned $16 billion of value to share owners, nearly $10 billion in dividends and $6.5 billion in share repurchase. Consistent with our guidance at the start of the fiscal year, moving to fourth quarter results, organic sales rounded up to 2%. Volume was in line with prior year. Pricing and mix were each up 1%.\nGrowth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions as nine of 10 product categories held or grew. Organic sales, fabric care, home care, feminine care, family care, grooming, oral care, personal health care, and skin and personal care each grew low single digits. Hair care was in line with prior year and baby care was down low single digits. Six of seven regions held or grew organic sales.\nFocus markets were up 1%. Organic sales in North America were in line with prior year. While we continue to see solid consumption growth in North America of around 2%. Sell-in trails sell-out due to retailer inventory reductions. Europe focused markets organic sales were up 2%. Greater China organic sales grew 2%. Another quarter of sequential improvement and positive momentum heading into fiscal 2026.\nThe 618 key consumption period was relatively strong, but we are closely watching economic and consumer confidence impacts resulting from higher US tariffs on Chinese imports. Enterprise Markets grew 3% for the quarter. Latin America organic sales were up 6% including double-digit growth in Mexico, more than offsetting a modest sales decline in Brazil due to trade inventory reductions. Europe Enterprise Markets and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa Enterprise Markets regions each grew organic sales low singles.\nGlobal aggregate market share was down 20 basis points. 28 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.48, up 6% versus prior year and on a currency-neutral basis, Core EPS increased 5%. These results include a $0.03 impact from tariffs. Core gross margin was down 70 basis points and core operating margin increased 150 basis points. Very strong productivity improvement of 560 basis points with healthy reinvestment in innovation and demand creation. Currency-neutral Core operating margin increased 170 basis points.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity was 110%, and we returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners this quarter, $2.6 billion in dividends and $700 million in share repurchase. In summary, another year of sales and earnings growth and strong cash return to shareholders in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. With that, I'll pass it back to Jon.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Andre. I'll start with a few thoughts on results before discussing the strategy. We're pleased with the performance P&G people delivered last fiscal year in the face of a very dynamic, difficult, and volatile environment. Growing sales and profit and returning high levels of cash to share owners despite heightened consumer anxiety with tariffs, inflation, interest rates, political and social divisiveness, and immigration and employment status uncertainty, all resulting in lower category growth, an unpredictable geopolitical environment, and against highly capable competitors.\nWhile not all results are at the levels we aspired to deliver at the beginning of the year, growth in this environment is worth acknowledging. To be clear, there's more work to do to continue improving the areas in our control, which will be needed to offset the headwinds that are largely not in our control.\nThe restructuring program we announced last month is one important step towards strengthening the execution of our integrated strategy. I'll talk more about this later at Investor Day. Last year and at recent investor conferences, we've highlighted the significant growth opportunities we have ahead of us just in the categories where we play today in North America.\nUp to $5 billion of market potential simply by growing household penetration of our brands among currently unserved or underserved consumers in Europe. More than $10 billion of opportunity by driving consumption and growing markets to the current best in class levels in the region while maintaining current market share in Enterprise Markets. $10 to $15 billion of sales opportunity by driving per capita consumption to the levels we currently have in Mexico.\nPositioning ourselves to capture these growth opportunities and manage the increasing near term challenges is best accomplished with disciplined execution of our integrated growth strategy with aocus on driving category growth and value creation. A focused portfolio of daily use products in categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies.\nWe're active managers of this portfolio. Over the last several years we've made some targeted additions and subtractions in our brand portfolio. We've adjusted our operating model in several markets. We'll be making additional portfolio moves as part of the new restructuring program.\nNext, an ongoing commitment to an investment in integrated irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value holistically defined, leveraging that superiority to delight consumers, grow markets, and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners.\nThe innovation plans across the businesses are broad and strong as each category team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights, communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands and price to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete.\nNo one of the five superiority vectors can carry the day by itself. It's all five working together. A few recent examples in China Pampers is driving growth in the premium and super premium segments of the market by consistently upgrading and clearly communicating its superior offerings to deliver ultimate comfort, protection and luxury softness on skin. In fiscal 2025, Pampers grew organic sales nearly 20% in China and increased value share by over 2 points, growing share in both offline and online channels. Pampers grew its point of market entry share, becoming the best diaper for newborns among moms less than 30 years old.\nSK-II recently launched a supercharged product line called LXP. It contains our highest concentration of PITERA, delivering eight times faster visible results and is positioned in the super premium segment of the prestige skin market. This superior product in a beautiful package sold online and in department stores with upgraded counters and beauty counselors is a superior shopping experience and value for the PITERA-loving loyal consumer.\nThe superior LXP messaging has the added benefit of haloing over the total SK-II brand and is building brand equity through consistent recognition from top beauty award groups. During the most recent key consumption event in China, SK-II and Pampers led growth in their respective categories, outperforming the market and gaining share.\nAnother example in Latin America: Pantene's Deep Conditioning Treatment collection is leading category growth, leveraging formulas featuring visibly enticing melting pearls, which deliver superior hair repair. Superior advertising with compelling visuals and retail execution with beautiful end-aisle displays communicate the benefit and value for the consumer seeking softer, shinier hair. Mexico Hair Care Organic Sales were up mid-teens in fiscal 2025 with value share growth over 1.5 points.\nSwiffer recently introduced the Sweep & Mop Deluxe, the first major upgrade to the original Swiffer Sweeper since its launch 25 years ago and following the Swiffer PowerMop launch last year. Swiffer Sweep & Mop Deluxe features a sturdier stick that collapses in half for easy storage and two-in-one dry and wet cleaning capabilities. It's designed for efficient floor cleaning and is great for small spaces. Early launch results indicate 6% new users and 30% incremental sales to the Swiffer Sweeper starter kit business.\nFor the PowerMop launch, the Swiffer team brought several top TikTok creators into their labs to learn about PowerMop from P&G scientists and create engaging communication from there. The creator's social media content was tested with P&G's proprietary AI Studios. This process ultimately created the superior mop smarter campaign across TV, digital, and influencer marketing to connect with consumers in fresh ways.\nSwiffer PowerMop has become the largest product launch in Swiffer's history, contributing to 40% of the growth of the Swiffer portfolio and driving 35% of category growth, making it the number one growth driver in the category. In the US digestive wellness market, Align launched its Bloating Relief and Food Digestion version to address the number one unmet need for nearly half of all consumers: bloating associated with the inability to digest food.\nAlign delivered meaningful product innovation and communicated the symptom by showing one of the most common and relatable signs of bloating for consumers not being able to button their pants. This spring, Align launched its first 3-in-1 Biotic: a prebiotic to nourish good bacteria, a probiotic to soothe bloating, and a postbiotic to support immune health. This new innovation is off to a strong start, enabling Align to accelerate share growth since launch.\nFinally, Tide evo, our new laundry detergent developed on our breakthrough functional fibers platform, has started its first stage of national expansion with an online launch of Tide evo. Free and gentle evo offers superior cleaning performance in a recyclable package with no plastic bottles or water in test market stores. Tide evo sales have been highly incremental to category growth and retailer demand has been well above initial expectations. We're in the process of adding manufacturing capacity and we'll have more to share about this exciting innovation over the coming months.\nThere are many more examples across all categories, more than we have time to discuss in detail this morning. One third-party measure of innovation success is the Circana US New Products Pacesetters report. In 2024, P&G earned four of the top ten spots for the most successful non-food product launches of the year, as measured by retail sales, and five of the top 25. This marks the fifth year in a row that we have had at least three of the top 10 entries.\nOur five entries in the top 25 list are the most by any individual company for the seventh consecutive year and more than our seven closest competitors, Unilever, Kenvue, Kimberly-Clark, Colgate, L'Oreal, Clorox, Reckitt Benckiser, combined, for the fifth consecutive year.\nL'Oréal, Clorox, and Reckitt combined for the fifth consecutive year. Looking forward, P&G has seven entries on the Pacesetters Rising Stars list for next year, including Downy Comfy cozy fabric enhancer, Febreze premium seasonal collection air care, Gain Mood Collection detergent, Luvs Platinum Protection diapers, Mr. Clean 2x Concentrated Cleaner, Oral-B iO Series 2 power brushes and Secret whole-body deodorant sprays. For perspective, all three of our products on the Rising Stars last year.\nFinished in the top 10 for the current year. Third strategy element, productivity improvement in all areas of our operation to fund Investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth, to mitigate cost and currency challenges and to expand margins and generate cash. We have an objective for growth savings in cost of goods sold up to $1.5 billion before tax, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories.\nWith Supply Chain 3.0, we have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency, and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. Visibility to more savings opportunity is increasing as the businesses continue to build their three-year rolling productivity master plans, and as we accelerate productivity with our restructuring efforts.\nNext element of the strategy: constructed disruption of ourselves and our industry, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends, technologies, and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. Finally, we've designed and continue to refine an empowered, agile, and accountable organization. An inclusive and diverse organization enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers.\nThere are times when continuous improvement of each element of the strategy is enough to deliver the near term objectives we've set and to prepare us for the next phase of growth and value creation. However, at times there's a need for a bigger step forward to bolster P&G's growth and value creation. The two-year restructuring program we announced is aimed at making changes to enable stronger delivery of our integrated growth strategy.\nThis is not a new approach, rather an intentional strengthening of our current strategy to widen our margin of advantage in superiority fueled by productivity to win in the increasingly challenging environment in which we compete. There are three main areas of focus: portfolio, supply chain, and organization design. The portfolio choices include exits of some categories, brands, and product forms and individual markets.\nThey may also include some brand divestitures. It takes time to plan the execution of these moves, and most have not been communicated broadly, so we can't discuss all of the details today. Our priority is communicating first to employees and to retail customers. Still, here are a few examples of the areas where we will be simplifying the portfolio, we'll be streamlining the feminine care pad lineup in several markets in Asia.\nSimilarly, in oral care, fabric care, and grooming, we'll be discontinuing small non strategic country product form combinations. We'll be discontinuing business operations in Bangladesh. This is not an exhaustive list, but a representation of the ways we're focusing our energy and resources on higher value creation opportunities. These portfolio moves enable us to make related investments, interventions in our supply chain, right-sizing, and right-locating production to drive efficiencies, faster innovation, cost reduction, and even more reliable and resilient supply.\nFinally, we're making additional changes to ensure an even more agile, empowered, and accountable organizational design making roles broader, teams smaller, work more fulfilling and more efficient, leveraging digitization and automation. Smaller teams with greater breadth of skills will work on an integrated end-to-end basis from consumer understanding to design and execution, eliminating the siloed approach to work, creating more integrated ways of working, broadening employees' skills to empower decision making, increasing individual contribution, and development, and improving the employee value proposition across these three areas.\nPortfolio, Supply Chain, Organization, we expect to reduce up to 7,000 non-manufacturing roles or roughly 15% of our current non-manufacturing workforce over the next two years. These steps have been in evaluation by the leadership team for some time. We've been thinking through some of these organization design changes since shortly after our last restructure change six years ago.\nAnd we've had pilots in Focus and Enterprise Markets in place for well over a year. The portfolio moves have been evaluated over the last year, following successful execution with other brands and markets over the past two years. I say all of this to ensure our owners that these are well thought-out plans, not knee-jerk reactions to recent slower markets or higher cost impacts.\nWe remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society, and share owners. We're taking steps to drive better execution and more investment in the strategy to grow markets and improve our ability to achieve our growth and value creation objectives. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre, to outline our guidance for the new year.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Jon. As we enter fiscal 2026, we continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging, from cost to currencies to consumer, consumer competitor, retailer, and geopolitical dynamics. We believe our going-in guidance for fiscal 2026 prudently reflects these market realities. On the top line, we currently expect the markets in which we compete to deliver local currency value growth in the range of flat to 3% for the year, with the current run rate roughly in the middle of this range.\nOur objective is to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth of these markets. However, our guidance includes a 30- to 50-basis-point headwind from brand and product form discontinuations as part of our two-year restructuring program. Taken together, our guidance range for organic sales growth is in line to up 4% versus prior year.\nThe low end of this range protects for additional softness in underlying market growth rates. The high end would require acceleration in underlying market growth, market shares. On the bottom line, we are guiding for Core EPS growth in line to +4% versus fiscal year 2025 Core EPS of $6.83. This guidance equates to a range of $6.83 to $7.09 per share, $6.96 or up 2% at the center of the range.\nThis outlook includes a commodity cost headwind of approximately $200 million after tax and a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $300 million after tax. In addition, our outlook includes $1 billion before tax in higher costs from tariffs in fiscal 2026. This is based on tariff rates announced since July 9 and assumes USMCA exceptions, exemptions still apply for imports from Canada and Mexico.\nYou can think about the tariff impact in three buckets: about $200 million from materials and products imported from China to the US, another 200 million from Canada's tariffs on goods shipped from the US, and the remaining 600 million from tariffs on goods coming to the US from the rest of the world. At these rates, tariffs alone are a 5-point headwind to Core EPS growth in fiscal 2026. We will look for every opportunity to mitigate these impacts, including sourcing flexibility, productivity improvements, and pricing with innovation in affected categories and markets.\nBelow the operating line, we expect modestly higher interest expense versus last fiscal year and a core effective tax rate in the range of 20 to 21% for fiscal 2026 combined, roughly a $250 million after-tax headwind to earnings growth. We are forecasting Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity in the range of 85 to 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories and as we incur the cash cost from the restructuring book.\nWe expect to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase approximately $5 billion in common stock. Combined, the plan to return roughly $15 billion of cash to share owners in fiscal 2026. These guidance ranges reflect current market realities for consumption and costs, including tariffs.\nThey also reflect our desire to maintain strong investment in the business to enable delivery of our growth algorithm over two- and three-year rolling periods as we work through market and cost volatility. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major supply chain disruptions, or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. With that, I'll hand it back to Jon for closing thoughts.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe're very pleased with the results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging and volatile environment, growing sales, growing earnings, and returning strong levels of cash to share owners. We continue to believe the best path to sustainable balanced growth is to double down on the strategy.\nExcellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. Starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, we're taking proactive steps to improve the execution of strategy and our ability to deliver our growth and value creation objectives.\nI'm looking forward to being with you through the calendar year as CEO and then as Executive Chair. I'm excited by the additional contributions that Shailesh and our team will make to delight consumers, customers, employees, society, and through this, our share owners. With that, we'll be happy to take any questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have a question, please press Star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star followed by two. Your first question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAhead. Thank you and good morning, everybody. Picking up on last night's announcement, I guess I'd like to begin by extending my congratulations to Shailesh, assuming he's listening somewhere. And also say congratulations to you and the entire team, Jon, on what appears a well-thought-out transition. Two questions stemming from that, if I could.\nFirst, I know we'll hear a lot more from Shailesh starting in about six months, but maybe you could offer a bit more perspective, Jon, on what you see as Shailesh's unique attributes, and why you feel he's the right person to succeed you. While also elaborating on your goals as you think about the pivot to Executive Chairman, and then secondly shifting back to the business.\nShailesh spoke in early June about the importance of P&G working, as he put it, to create its own tailwinds as we enter fiscal 2026 in order to reaccelerate category growth and P&G's own top line. You spoke to the innovation slate this year and overall priorities, but could you elaborate further on those tailwind creation efforts and when within the fiscal year you might expect them to accumulate into more tangible overall results? Thank you.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Steve. As relates to Shailesh's strong suitability to lead the next phase of growth and value creation for the company. He has successfully led our largest businesses, specifically the Fabric and Home Care sector most recently. He's led businesses in both enterprise markets and focus markets. Most recently as COO, he had responsibility for P&L responsibility for each of the enterprise markets. As COO, he gained even deeper knowledge of some of our functional skill sets and capabilities.\nSo he'll bring all of that to bear, combined with 36 years of experience. I've worked closely with Shailesh, most closely in the last number of years as he was COO and I was CEO, but we've worked in other capacities together over the years. So he's going to be a great, a very strong candidate to lead again the next phase of growth and value creation. I feel very, very good about that. It gives me a fair amount of peace and comfort as I move into my next chapter.\nIn terms of creating our own headwinds, or, sorry, tailwinds, the last thing we need to do is create any more headwinds. The restructuring program that both Andre and I referenced in our remarks is a very good example of that. Building financial headroom to invest in innovation, invest in commercialization. That's the reason we're doing that, is to continue to create our own tailwinds to accelerate growth in what is otherwise a very, very difficult environment. Focusing those efforts on the categories and brands and markets that matter is another example of creating our own tailwinds.\nWe continue to create tremendous advantage with all the work that we're doing in supply, both to improve service to consumers and customers, reduce costs, creating more financial headroom, and then obviously the appropriate levels of investment and expertise focused on the next round of innovation, the next round of commercialization.\nI took you through some of the on market examples in my prepared remarks, and there are many exciting things coming, not just in the categories we currently compete in, but also selectively, a few additional categories. So again, I move to my next assignment with a sense of excitement and anticipation for what the team will accomplish. That's one thing I think is important to emphasize when we have these kinds of leadership rotation.\nBig multinational business is not a me sport. It is a we sport. I'm most comforted by the breadth and quality of the leadership team, the breadth and quality of the organization that's been executing against the strategies that have generated some of the results that we've been talking about. I'll leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. I'll just echo everything that Steve so eloquently said both to you, Jon, and to Shailesh. It was great to get the context of your expectations for market growth and also kind of the current rate. But one thing that's become true over the last couple of quarters is the outperformance of P&G versus its categories. That gap has narrowed and narrowed and narrowed. And that's with what I think has still been a very steady slate of innovation, of consistent reinvestment.\nSo notwithstanding all the words you just shared around consistency of strategy and confidence in the strategy, what do you think maybe needs to change? And maybe we can focus just on North America to widen that gap back out where your innovation, your strategies are in fact growing the categories and by virtue of that, growing your share. Because that math doesn't seem to be working more recently. So whether it's competitive environment, particular cohorts in the consumer landscape that have been more challenged, what your perspective would be on how that gap kind of widens back out to support P&G outperformance. Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'll provide some perspective on your accurate observations and our response to them, and then I'll ask Andre to do the same from his vantage point. In North America specifically we have kind of three things that are happening. One is the reduction in category growth rates. The second is, so you know, if you're operating within a category that's growing at a lower rate, by definition, your margin of growth advantage narrows. Second it's, as Andre mentioned in his remarks, the relationship between sell in and sell out, where we've seen inventory reductions on the part of our retail partners that is exaggerated by the shift of shopping across the retail channels.\nThe channels that are growing the quickest right now typically carry lower levels of on hand inventory, whether that's Walmart, whether that's Amazon, whether that's club stores. The third and probably most important is that we do have categories where we've lost superiority, and we simply must regain that level of superiority that allows us to outgrow the market. That's why we're going through the restructuring program that we are. There are specific plans, as you can imagine; they're competitively sensitive.\nI'm not going to go into, you know, step by step elements, but you should assume that we clearly understand that we have work to do there. Hopefully the restructuring program gives you some confidence that we're committed to do exactly that. Obviously as these things come to market, we'll be talking about more about them as early as the back to school conference in September. Andre, any other thoughts?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nNo, I echo what you said, Jon. I think maybe to be specific and give you some confidence here, as Jon said, I think in some categories we have not been able to maintain the level of superiority that we know we need in order to grow the category and grow within the category. But we also know that when we do that, the business quickly reaccelerates and picks up.\nSo if you take baby care for example, while the premium end of the lineup has been growing consistently because we've innovated consistently on Spotless, on Cruisers, 360, et cetera, the lower end, the value tier had not delivered. When we put innovation on Luvs with Platinum Protection, the category grew re-accelerated, our share re-accelerated, and our organic sales re-accelerated. We have the same opportunity on Olay on the core jars business.\nSo we know we're not superior. We know we need to adjust and we're on it. But where we have superiority in the Olay lineup, like Super Serum, we bring in 65% of business via new users. So we grow the category, we grow share within the category, and then we just have a few S curves that will just fundamentally change the category operations, which is evo, which will launch in the back half of the year.\nWe've got it in the online business right now, but we'll, we firmly plan to expand that further. So there's plenty of proof. We know what to do. We need to execute brilliantly, and we create the fuel to do that with the restructuring and the productivity efforts that you see. The second part I'll leave you with is the new business opportunity of $5 billion that we quote is real.\nThese are underserved and unserved consumers that we can access. But this is only a number on a piece of paper until we allocate resources to it, which is exactly what we're doing. And doubling down to ensure that regions, segments, consumer groups that we have not as actively pursued in the US we are going after with full intention and all the resources we have.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAnd I think, Lauren, as you just. Again, to the heart of your question on reaccelerating the gap in performance or the advantage in performance between P&G and the competitive set. I mean, one thing you need to look at is who is positioning themselves for the level of investment that we're describing here. I won't speak to others, but we are intent on ensuring that we're well positioned to do exactly what we described.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go head.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. So Jon, congrats on a remarkable run at driving shareholder value and Shailesh on his greater responsibilities. Jon, can you discuss how the restructuring you recently announced will enable greater organizational capabilities? Looking forward to particularly just given the external technology advancements that we've seen and how those two points interplay with each other. And on the other piece of big news with the CEO change, all the background on Shailesh's capabilities is very helpful. Just any insight or perspective on the timing of the CEO change. Why is now or technically January the right time to move to new leadership. Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGreat. I'm going to start with the last part of your question, Dara, and usually when I do that, you'll have to repeat the first part. But in terms of why now? You said technically January 1st. It's not technically January 1st, it's actually January 1st. The only reason I emphasize that is because the next observation I'm going to make, as of January 1st, I will have served this company for 38 years.\nMy wife worked for this company in a senior executive capacity until she retired, when I became CEO. Between the two of us, we'll have served this company for seven decades, almost 3/4 of a century. The results that you referred to and that have been delivered give me comfort in the strength of the strategy, the sustainability of the strategy. If you go back to when we completed the articulation of the strategy and began executing against it, which was seven years ago in 2018.\nThis team has built, has created $17.5 billion in incremental sales, which puts us at the 84th percentile of the S&P 500. At the same time, they've generated $6 billion in incremental profit, which puts us at the 92nd percentile of the S&P 500, creating, as you referenced, significant market cap growth of $180 billion more value creation than all but one of our competitors have created over their entire one- and two-century histories as a company. So seven years vis-à-vis one or two centuries.\nAnd in the process, the team has built the 18th most valuable publicly US publicly traded company, the 21st most valuable in the world. So we embark on our next chapter from a position of strength, both from a strategic standpoint and from an executional standpoint. We've recently, and Andre mentioned we, you know, described this first, at the Deutsche Bank conference in Paris in June, strengthened the execution of that strategy, which gives me further comfort that we'll be able to execute against that.\nAnd as I mentioned, we have a very strong team, inclusive of Shailesh. And so I just look at all of this and say this is the right time to make a transition as we lap the fiscal year. I'm very confident we'll be able to do that in a very constructive way. In terms of the timing of the cadence that you asked about, in terms of when these tailwinds that we're creating for ourselves bear fruit, as you would expect, there's an executional period, there's a planning period that has to occur, there's an executional phase, and then we get to impact. That will build as we go through the fiscal year and into next.\nOh, sorry. You always ask very complex questions, Dara. So my team here has reminded me that, as is typical, overlooked one of your key questions, and it's a very important one, which is how is, you know, how are we thinking about the organization design and why do we. Why does that give us confidence and what tailwinds does that create?\nMany of you have probably heard me talk about this before. It's one of my pet topics to talk about because I think there's so much, there, there. You know, industry, broadly defined, has operated over the last 100 years in a very siloed, heavily functional organization model.\nBut the world has changed and the world isn't thinking about things that way. And so I think there is immense opportunity to tear down some of those silos and in the process build better and quicker decision making, more efficient, work processes, and a much higher employee value proposition. Each one of those things by themselves would make a significant difference in terms of the creation of tailwinds that we've been talking about together. I think they're extraordinarily powerful and that expands across the activity system of the enterprise. So the potential there is significant.\nWell, one last thing, because you also referred to this. That would have been a very, very difficult task or reality to get your arms wrapped around without the advent of some of the technology that we have available to us now. So now is the time to utilize those tools and empower the organization to move forward. Each one of those functional silos that I referred to largely historically and even currently has their own data repository.\nThere are people within each of those functions, and I mean each and every, whose job is to create, maintain, extract, translate all of that data. Our objective is to make that seamlessly available to everybody on an end-to-end basis, not siloed just like the organizations are siloed, not hard to access, and obviously utilizing the analytical and even predictive tools that are increasingly available. Sorry for the long answer, but when you ask a long question, you get a long.nswer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you and congratulations from me too to both Shailesh and Jon. Jon, we're really all going to miss seeing you, especially at CAGNY, but of course you're always welcome. So I just had a few questions on your FY.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMy team just frowned. Bonnie.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOh no.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe smiled.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nDoes that mean they want you or no, we'd love to keep seeing.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGo ahead, Bonnie. Sorry.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOh, no, no, that's fine. But I just had a few questions on your FY26 guidance if I may. First, your ranges are quite a bit wider than they've been historically. Now, I certainly recognize there's a fair amount of volatility, uncertainty, but is there any other reason maybe why you have less visibility on your business right now? And then also your guidance does imply deleverage at the midpoint, so maybe help us to understand the puts and takes of this. And then finally, how are you thinking about phasing in the year? Should we assume, you know, EPS growth will be back half weighted? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'll take a run at this. And Jon, please jump in here. Morning, Bonnie. Just for the record, we were smiling or frowning on the top line. I think the reality that we're seeing is simply a lack of clarity on where the category growth is going to go. Our midpoint assumes that growth rates in the US and in Europe stay about where we see them today, which is around 2%, maybe a little bit lower in the most recent weekly data.\nChina continuing on its path to growth. Not quite there. And Latin America and enterprise markets in general remaining at around 5.6% of category growth. So if that holds true, we think we can be at the midpoint or slightly higher. There is a scenario where the categories re-accelerate to historical growth rates. Europe and the US return to 3 to 4%.\nChina accelerates, Latin America re-accelerates beyond 6%, and that's the upper end of the range. The lower end of the range is the opposite. We see the deceleration that we saw over the last few months continue in Europe and in the US, China not really gaining positive trajectory, and enterprise markets remain muted, specifically in the Asia, Middle East, Africa region. So that's just the reality we're looking at. And it's very hard to say where in that range we're going to be, so we find it prudent to give you transparency on where the range is on the top line. Then you move to the EPS line, and it's first of all an outcome of where we think we're going to be on the top line.\nBut then you have incremental volatility coming from tariff negotiations that are ongoing. And again, you saw from Deutsche Bank to today we saw $400 million increase in tariff exposure with the EU trade deal over the weekend we saw $100 million decrease. So there's a lot of swing here from a tariff standpoint. You then have to assume what can you pass on in terms of pricing after we maximize productivity and how much of that pricing is going to be sticking in the market. And you have foreign exchange and commodity volatility that you always have.\nSo you layer all of that on top, and you can see easily between the top line and those effects. All the range is wider than we typically have. In any case, be assured, our objective is to firmly be at the upper end of the range, and we work and do everything we can to be in the middle of upper range. But again, there's many factors on the macro side which we don't control, which we have to take into account.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nQuarterly timing.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJon reminds me on the quarterly timing. It is going to be an upward trajectory on EPS. As you can appreciate, some of the pricing recovery of the tariffs will come later in the year. The category acceleration is expected to happen later in the year. It will be an upward trajectory from Q1 upwards. Right. And the savings as well are coming. Obviously, the restructuring savings are coming in the second half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, guys. Jon, Shailesh. Congratulations from my end as well. Jon, we're definitely going to miss you. So I kind of wanted to pick up on that last point, Andre. I wanted to get some perspective from actually for both of you, just in terms of category growth and kind of this trend line that we've seen over the last few months and how that compares to what you were expecting.\nI know the team's long expressed confidence in the category growth returning to historical averages, but the timing has been a bit of a wild card. I guess just going back to the last call, category growth is running at 2.5%. Andre, I think you mentioned it's now running closer to 1.5%. Can you maybe just unpack what's really happening, the drivers of the slowdown, and I guess, is it evolving as you would have expected? And then I guess just related.\nWhen you think about the guidance of flat to 3% growth, your commentary to Bonnie's question was really helpful. But how realistic is it to expect category growth to decelerate further? Is that simply. You are embedding some cushion here, or do you think that's a realistic outcome? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble",
    "content2": "Morning, Peter. Look. The reason why we have a wide guidance range on the top line is exactly because it's very hard to predict where the category growth line is going to go. What we are observing is that the consumer on both ends of the spectrum, the lower income consumer and the higher income consumer, they are reacting to the current volatility they are seeing and they are observing.\nWe see consumption trends consistently decelerating, not significantly, but we see a deceleration in the US, we see a deceleration in Europe, and those are the biggest regions that have an immediate impact on the global category growth numbers. The volatility the consumer is seeing, I think, is maybe not necessarily grounded in their current reality, but more on what to expect for the future. So consumers are a bit more careful in terms of consumption.\nThey are using up pantry inventory and they are looking for value either in smaller packs, and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online. That's a behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued. So the trajectory here could be that we've reached the low point and the consumer gains confidence, the labor market is stable, inflation doesn't pick up, and therefore we see category growth returning to 3% to 4% or not. And that's exactly the reason why we have a guidance range that is relatively wide. Our job in all of that, and that's why I come back to where Jon started.\nOur job is to create our own tailwinds. Our job is to create category growth, create an incentive for the consumer to return to the category, and find value in our propositions every day. And these categories, even though the consumer slows down for a period of time, they don't stop doing their laundry, they don't stop washing their hair, they don't stop using diapers. That's why we're exactly in these categories.\nSo overall, I feel good about the portfolio, I feel very good about the innovation. But there is a level of baseline uncertainty that we reflect in the guidance range.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJust to build on that a little bit, we've talked about this before but you know, to the extent that people are frustrated, and I would say understandably frustrated with the lack of certainty and the breadth of the range. Trust me, there's no one more frustrated with that than I. But as you look at the predictability and you think about things like what's the impact of immigration status and immigration policy on consumption over time? What's the impact of tariffs and related, both pricing and potential supply chain shifts, and portfolio shifts over time? If you look at a place, you know, what's the impact of inflation? What's the impact of interest rates?\nWe talked about the acceleration of growth in China, but that comes largely driven by the month of June, which is a heavy promotion period in China. I don't know how much of that went into inventory and how much was actually consumed. So there are just all those uncertainties that are out there. And as Andre rightfully said, we're just trying to give you the benefit of that aggregated perspective in terms of what outcomes might be. And you know, our job is to wake up each morning, put both feet on the floor and power ahead, to do the best that we can in creating the tailwinds that we've described and seeing that impact in the market. And that's what we're committed to.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAnd just one last point, I just want to reassure you the strategy has not changed. We will push as hard as we can to generate category growth because we believe that's the only way to sustainably create value and regain share momentum. The easy answer would be to react to strong promotions we're seeing in the market with equal promotion response.\nThat would protect share in the short term, but it would protect share of a contracting category. So you will not see us go there. You will see us continue to innovate, drive market growth. And you kind of heard the story in the beginning of the call. So that ties right into why we are where we are, independent of where we see the category.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nTo that end, every time that I interact with our organization, I remind them that our job in the face of uncertainty is to step forward, not backward. And we will do that. I think the restructuring is a reflection of our commitment to do that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question and congrats to Jon and to Shailesh as well. Andre, I wanted to ask maybe one clarification and then one follow up. I believe in response to Bonnie's question, you mentioned that maybe the $1 billion tariff headwind had moved down by about $100 million after this past weekend with Europe. So I just wanted to clarify that as a first piece.\nAnd then secondly on the $600 million within the tariff bucket that you kind of said of rest of the world, just a bit broader. But as we continue to get kind of more trade announcements, just can you help us identify how much flexibility there maybe is in that? I don't know. If Brazil isn't really at a 50% rate, is there flex for that to move? Just other kind of countries around the world that could impact that. Thanks very much.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks for the question, Peter. Yeah. So the tariff announcements over the weekend indeed have reduced at face value $1 billion to $900 million BT, but we don't fully understand what's in that agreement yet. So I would take that with a grain of salt until we really see the details. And yes, I think there are. It's very hard for us to judge what is real and what is not real. So we're reflecting spot like we do in commodities, like we do on fx. So we're just taking every announcement at face value and pricing it out from a tariff standpoint.\nI would caution us to be too optimistic that future trade agreements will be a significant tailwind. The other question here is how much of the pricing that we're taking will actually remain in market if that turns into a tailwind from a tariff perspective. So I would see the two as equalizing. So I would not view, and that's what we're telling our organization, don't assume you're getting tailwind from decreased tariffs because if the tariffs come down, most likely the pricing will not sustain in the market. So I would see those two as moving in parallel.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJust to give you even additional perspective on the difficulty here, and to encourage you not to spend a ton of time on it, I'll just give two examples, three examples of the uncertainty that exists currently. This isn't a judgment or criticism; it's just a reflection of reality. We don't, as Andre said, really have details for these agreements. It's hard to analyze exactly how they would impact our business. The second there's a whole round of work that's going on under the heading of what's referred to as 232 investigations, which are headed by the Commerce Department.\nThat work hasn't been completed. It's designed to assess the strategic risk that's imposed by overdependence on imports of certain goods and products. So, for example, metals, but also inclusive of pulp within that, wood pulp within that there's the whole question of exemption from tariffs for USMCA-compliant materials. We don't know if that's going to hold under the new policies. The last piece I would mention is also very, very difficult to get your arms around, which is the potential for retaliatory tariffs.\nWhat these will be are tariffs imposed by other countries on the US. That's the situation we have right now with Canada, who's imposed 25% tariffs on imports of products from the US into Canada. And in our case, that ends up being a big impact, which Andre referenced in his remarks, because most of our Canadian business is sourced from the US. So that just gives you again a little bit of a picture of the degree of uncertainty that's in there. There's upside potential within that, though. I think Andre's caution is rightly presented.\nAnd there's just a range of outcomes that we're all going to have to get comfortable managing with. And the best thing I know to do in that situation, again, is step forward on those things we can control, which is exactly what we're doing with restructuring. It's exactly what we're doing with spending portfolios. It's exactly what we're doing with innovation. I'm not out there asking our innovation teams to slow anything down. Quite the contrary.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I also wanted to extend my congratulations to Shailesh and Jon on your new roles. So, for my question, I wanted to zoom in on the US market, your largest market. Clearly, we've talked about some of the consumption slowdown, but from a retailer standpoint, we've also seen the impact of the inventory destocking that you talked about. I'm just curious, why do you think we've seen this more pronounced deceleration over the last two quarters?\nBecause some of the comments you made about the channels that are growing faster, having lower inventory, those have been going on for a while, but really over the last two quarters we've seen a much bigger negative impact from destocking. So maybe can you give us a sense of what is happening at the retailer level? Are there certain categories that are getting impacted, and do you think that negative impact in the US will continue in H1 2016 until you cycle some of those impact in Q3 of next year? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood Morning, Filippo. You're right. I think the channel shifting has been an effect that we've observed for a number of months, but it also is an effect that isn't stopping. So we continue to see strength in the online channel, we continue to see strength in Walmart, in Costco, in club in general, and in Amazon.\nAnd obviously as that trend continues, those retailers are more inventory efficient. So that will continue to be a headwind until that trend changes. When and if that changes is a question I can't answer. The other point I think that is clear. Retailers have to deal with tariff impacts as well as they allocate cash and inventory. And as tariff impacts become real and hit their cash availability.\nThey have to make choices. We are fast turning categories. The easiest way to make a choice and reallocate cash is in our categories. So if you need to free up cash for other general merchandise, you go to CPG because we have the fastest turn, so you free up the fastest amount of cash, which is the second driver.\nI think the third driver is if consumption slows, a retailer would react with reducing the inventory because you don't quite need as many turns as you would in a fast growing consumer environment. So all of those effects coming together, none of them give us certainty on to what degree this inventory contraction will continue or if inventory actually would come back over the next few quarters. I can tell you what our assumption is.\nOur assumption is relatively stable inventory levels going forward, but we've not made any assumption on returning inventory levels. It's not just the US. In Brazil, for example, we saw a 10-point inventory effect between consumption and organic sales growth. These effects are visible not only in the US but also in other parts of the world. And again introduce a level of variability which is reflected in our guidance range.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAnd just to be clear, I'm not suggesting that you were suggesting otherwise. But in general lower inventory throughout the system is a good thing. Leads to more efficient operations of the entire supply chain from our suppliers through to our inventory, through to retail inventory, all of which has a cost associated with it. So this is there's a silver lining in this as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Carey\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about China specifically. Andre. I think you characterized it as another quarter of sequential improvement with 618 being relatively strong. Can you talk about just the durability of the trends that you're seeing? 618 is obviously more of a, you know, annual seasonal event, but really sort of underlying durability that you may or may not be seeing in the market. I think there is this dynamic where P&G and your peers are still waiting to assess the impact of tariffs on the economy and what it means for the Chinese consumer in the months ahead.\nAs such, you're perhaps a bit more measured on carrying through this improvement that you've seen in the market into our quarters. So can you just contextualize again the durability versus the one-time nature that we may have seen in the quarter and just how we would see the medium term in the context of what will be an evolving consumer landscape in China? Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nEverything you said is accurate but there are some things that are encouraging. I'll give you two of those. One is the trend continues to be more positive. That doesn't offer any definitive perspective on what the future is going to hold. But it's not like this thing is bouncing all around, it's generally improving.\nSecond, the Chinese consumer continues to be very responsive to innovation. I gave you two examples in our prepared remarks where Pampers is growing at 20%, where SK-II is growing very, very strong double digits. So it comes back to our activity system and what we do to ensure that the best propositions are available. The best value to Chinese consumers is the most important and certain way to control our destiny, which we're very focused on. But you know, I don't see anything personally that causes me, you know, concern of another shock in the system, so to speak. But I haven't foreseen those in the past. Andre, any perspective from your.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nNo, I think you're right. I feel very encouraged about the picture in China right now. The market, as Jon says, hasn't returned to growth, but its trajectory is positive. It's more balanced across channels than we've seen in the past. It's less pronounced in key consumption periods, more in line with consumption patterns. All of those are good things. It doesn't look great in aggregate yet, but it's getting better.\nBut the most encouraging thing I'll tell you is the progress our team is making on the ground. Jasmine and her team have changed every element of the business model to adapt to a different reality. They have changed the go-to-market model, including the entire distributor lineup, to ensure that our propositions show up in stores better, more consistently than they ever have in the past.\nThat is showing progress. We have adopted our media model, we've adopted our innovation model, we've adapted our customer value creation model. All those things start to show progress, which I think I like to believe is part of the 2% growth we were able to generate. In pockets like Jon said, SK-II up 23% now, admittedly on a lower base, but also baby care consistently growing. We see pockets of real strength in China emerging. So that in aggregate makes me feel better than I felt about China in a long.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThis is kind of neither here nor there, but I lived and worked in China for a while, admittedly a long time ago in the late 1990s. But I stayed very close to that market and that organization partially as a result of that. And you can, to Andre's point I can tell within five minutes walking into one of our facilities how things are going both immediately and more broadly. I just talked to Shailesh earlier this week who returned from China last week. The indications from an organization standpoint and their confidence has significantly and sequentially improved. So that's very encouraging.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks. Morning everyone. Jon. Celeste, naturally want to extend my congratulations to both of you as well. Jon, much to be proud of given your remarkable career. I want to pick up on elements of Warren and Peter's question though, specifically on consumer trade down risk, given what remains the more premium price portfolio at Procter.\nSo the context, of course the company's made significant progress extending pricing ladders going back to the global financial crisis. Tide Simply in Fabric Care would be just one example of that. And while private label share is not accelerating, we are seeing some level of trade down. But U.S. Fabric Care would be another example of that where your key competitor leads with a value price offering. And we're seeing share pick up there.\nSo it doesn't seem like it may be a brand superiority issue in all cases, rather more sort of a commoditization, if you will, that we're seeing across staples, right where consumers are making decisions. And increasingly this is kind of weighing on category growth in certain cases for Procter, weighing on market share performance. So can you comment on that assessment, whether you think that's accurate or not? And then just broadly on implications as you address trade down risk in your categories. I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Kevin. Let me start with a few numbers and then I'll go into the more strategic part of that question. I think. We see, I think, some level of pressure to drive trade down because of price promotional behavior. So private label, for example, volume share flat, but value share down both in Europe and in the US, that indicates more aggressive pricing from retailer standpoint.\nOn retailer brands, that doesn't result in share growth, but it's certainly an attempt to drive volume and traffic into a lower priced part of the portfolio. We also see significant promo levels in mid tier laundry, which is driving some of the trade down. As I've indicated before, we don't think that's a winning strategy. It doesn't generally return value share growth. It might return volume share growth in the short term, but it certainly compresses the category. We also see some trade down in our portfolio. Jon mentioned this earlier, from Tide into, maybe Tide Simply or Gain.\nBut that is part of our strategy, as you said, to serve the consumer across the price tier and across the value tier that we choose to play in. We need to innovate across all of those value tiers, be it Luvs and baby care or be it Gain and Tide Simply in laundry. I think the most important point to your question, are we concerned about commoditization? I don't think so. If you look at our categories, the consumer satisfaction in our categories is still remarkably low. Only 25% of consumers believe that they are or are happy with their laundry detergent performance in the wash. It doesn't come out clean enough. It doesn't come out smelling nice enough.\n50% of diapers still fail and leak. Only 30% of women are happy with their protection during that period. So there's this satisfaction, and I firmly believe, and I think we all do, that the path of better innovation, better performance at adequate value is an enormous opportunity to not only grow the category, but grow our share within the category.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI think a great example of that is the test market results we've talked about on Tide evo in Colorado, where the market is growing ahead of the balance of geography where our share within that is growing. So there's true incrementality to the proposition. At a 50% premium to the average cost per laundry load.\nSo it's just another indication of the ability of delight from a product usage standpoint and performance against a specific job to be done that drives the category, and in terms of competitors investing in those kinds of things, innovation, communication of the benefits of that innovation, and the value of that innovation. I would much rather spend a dollar on those things every day than a dollar a promotion. There's nothing proprietary in promotion, so there's no long-term advantage that's conveyed. That's different than innovation driven growth.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJust to double down on coming full circle, we always prepare a list of our upcoming innovation just to get ourselves confident as we go into these calls. And I am very confident that we have both the technology, the commercialization ideas, and the innovation that allows us to capture that dissatisfaction that consumers still have in our categories and make incremental progress that allows us to regain both momentum on category growth, but also share.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nNik Modi\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning everyone. And Jon and Shailesh, congratulations from me as well. Just one clarification and one question on the clarification. Any perspective on which categories were experiencing the destocking during the quarter? If you could just help give us some frame there. And then the question is just kind of piggybacking on Dara's question.\nYou know, if you can give us some kind of specific outcomes that you saw in the test markets that you have kind of deployed this new organizational design, you know, anything specific you can provide us just so we can kind of understand, you know, what the broader implications be for the, for the entire company. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey, Nik, I'll start with your destocking question. It's broad-based. There's no specific category. I think the only insight I'll give you, the faster the turn in the category, the faster the impact. But it's broad-based, so no differentiation across categories. I would call out.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAnd. You know, each of the businesses is different across categories and across markets. So I hesitate to deploy a learning from a test market. But there is some commonality in what we've learned. One is that we can operate at significantly lower cost. Each of the pilots has identified the opportunity to do that, and we've yet to supply them with the IT tools that I talked about, which will drive that even further.\nThere hasn't been an experience that we've had in a market or a category where this hasn't been true and isn't felt with conviction. Which is why the leadership team, as we went through this during primarily the month of May, was confident signing up for the restructuring opportunity that we all felt that we have as a result of this. There's another commonality which is that and this was always one of the primary drivers for me, is that people are thrilled with the opportunity to have a wider impact, to have a wider scope to be more end-to-end decision makers than components of cogs in a factory that are trying to reach a decision in a very expensive and costly way.\nThere are, of course, there's a degree of concern within the organization, which is understandable in terms of just simply because we're looking to change things, and change causes a degree of uncertainty. But you know, if you just look at those two things alone, if you knew that you could operate at a significantly lower cost, and by the way, the business results in these tests have been strong.\nSo there's little risk in that regard. If you could operate at lower costs, if you can make decisions better and faster, and if people place more value in the relationship they had with the company. Those are strong motivations to push forward, which is exactly what we're doing. The specific implementation of role by role. Serial number by serial number, will be driven by the individual leaders of those businesses. We will share with them the learnings we have shared with them, the learnings that we've gained from the pilots.\nWe have a year-end. What we call our year-end meeting is an annual meeting of our leadership team here in Cincinnati in the early part of September. And one of the things we'll be featuring in that leadership team meeting is presentations from each of the pilot leaders to the balance of the 250 people that lead this company on what they think is possible.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nEverybody. Good morning. Congratulations and thank you for all your help over the decades. Jon, congratulations to Shailesh. A question on that, maybe a little bit following up on some earlier questions: was often the timing of a change like this related to, you know, maybe a small or maybe a large pivot in what the world is going to look like over the coming, you know, three to five years.\nAnd so curious of, you know, whether it's data that you had mentioned, whether it's M&A, is there, you know, a bit of a philosophical pivot or shift in any way that would be related to the timing of this. And then the second question, more related to sort of the business right now, is the commentary on losing or not having the superiority position that you want in some categories. To what degree is that?\nYou know, in many ways just related to the last five years have been, have been complicated for a whole host of things. Did that maybe limit the ability to, you know, execute this playbook, which has been, you know, in place for quite some time, or is there something else that maybe led to the, you know, lagging within those categories for where you want to be? Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYou know, one example of what's occurred that will hopefully provide some specificity. China built a market supply system that anticipated a lot of growth within that market. The reverse has happened that supply is not going to go unutilized. We see it showing up in various markets around the world, including the US and to their credit, product quality is very high. So it's produced at a lower cost at very high quality. All of a sudden, overnight, we have a superiority gap that we need to close.\nBut we're actively monitoring those. We're actively, we have strong innovation plans designed to restore superiority across all price tiers. But that's an example much more so than an internal dynamic of too much difficulty and complexity. I don't see that being the primary driver here. And the reality is, and it's a good thing, we operate in a very competitive industry. We have strong competitors who are good at what they do. And again, that's a market constructive dynamic, which I welcome.\nAnd it pushes us to be better every day, which is a good thing. But I don't think there's anything limiting us from an internal standpoint or even from an external complexity standpoint in terms of continuing to execute this model that you rightly refer to. It's part of who we are, it's part of what we do, and has become much more so over the last number of years. I forget the first part of the question.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAny pivot in direction that drove the CEO change or any pivot you expect coming out of a CEO change?\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nNot to my knowledge.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you. And congrats to Shailesh and Jon. Jon, thank you, and you'll be missed. We've talked a bunch about the challenged state of the consumer, and yet. You're still seeing positive price, positive mix this quarter this year. So three questions there. First, are you surprised that consumers are still trading up and willing to accept price despite their current challenged state? Can you characterize your confidence and ability to price next year, some color on where you see the most need because of the tariffs or increasing costs? And then just on the fiscal 2026 outlook, your view on contribution from Focus versus Enterprise markets. Thanks so much.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMaybe I'll start with this. And Andre, can jump in. I'm not surprised by the consumer dynamics that you described. It was inherently part of the decision we made when we concentrated our portfolio into daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. Performance being a significant contributor to value, value holistically defined is much more than price.\nI expected that as we made these moves and this shift, we'd be even and continue to innovate that would be even more resilient, which largely has occurred. The second is if you just look at price as a component of our top line growth over long periods of time.\nWe've been. Price has been a positive contributor to that top line growth. I think close to 19 out of 20 in the last years. The combination of price and mix has been a positive contributor. The same occurs at the quarterly level. So this is part of the model of an innovation machine that operates in categories where performance drives value. In terms of future pricing. Given that past history, given our commitment to innovation, given what Andre described in the innovation pipeline, I don't see any reason why historical patterns don't play themselves forward.\nAnd if you think about something like Tide evo, there are many other examples. If you just look at the growth of both ends of the Oral-B business, the high-end iO10 and the entry price point on iO2. Which is a significant step up in terms of price versus a manual brush, and then to iO10 is even more significant price to participate in that product segment. They're growing extraordinarily well.\nSo I don't ever like to overly simplify things, but I really, really, really believe that superiority in terms of product, package, communication, go to market value, holistically defined, is primary. And ss long as we do that well and better than others, we're going to be in great shape and we'll be serving consumers at a very high level. If we fail to do that, then all bets are off. Which is why you see us being very proactive on creating the financial flexibility to continue to do exactly that.\nSo that's how I look at this dynamic. I think we're better positioned than almost any other company. I don't really think about it that way on a daily basis. I think about, are we better positioned today than we were yesterday, and will we, will we be better positioned tomorrow? I feel good about all of that. That doesn't mean there won't be challenges. You've seen challenges. It doesn't mean that competitors won't outcompete us in certain categories in certain markets in certain days, months, and quarters, but it's pretty strong reassurance, and our commitment to that approach should be pretty strong reassurance that this should be manageable.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nSecond part of your question will be our Enterprise Markets versus Focus Markets at aggregate level. I expect both to perform similarly in terms of top line growth and bottom line growth in the year. Obviously within the Enterprise Markets bucket, there's a lot of variability between markets. Turkey has returned to 17% organic sales growth. India still growing at 5%, still significant challenges in the Middle East. So you know, but you allowed me to do it at aggregate level. At aggregate level, we should be fairly consistent between the two segments, Focus Markets and Enterprise Markets.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThank you very much and congratulations all around for myself and Javier Escalante. Most of my questions have been answered, but one thing I would like to drill down into a little bit is kind of the difference between value and affordability. Obviously the superiority emphasis. This makes all the sense in the world. You want to give consumers more value, and that has worked. You've touched on affordability. But I guess the question is, number one, is this a consumer that really wants and needs more affordability?\nThere were some comments around that, and some behavior suggesting that. Then I guess the most important question is, do you believe that as an organization and how you look at the markets, look at the consumer, look at your innovation, that perhaps you need to? Or it would make sense to focus a little bit more on providing superiority that is more affordable for consumers. Thank you.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMake a couple comments there. Robert, thank you for the question. I think it's an important one. Affordability is a relevant concern. We get at that in a couple ways. One is making sure that we have a pack size that meets you know, dollar outlay. Capacity at the consumer level, and that becomes even more important in the environment that we're in. So in that context, an overdependence on large sizes, large pack sizes can be a problem and work against you from an affordability standpoint.\nSo we're very attentive to that. The second is once you get beyond dollar outlay and the capacity to outlay that dollar, it really does come down to an understanding of the benefit that I receive to understand whether something is, quote, affordable or not. It's all a relative comparison across categories, across brands. So ensuring that we have clarity. As we talk about advertising, for example, and by advertising, I mean that in a broadly defined way, in other words, advertising, package, shelf communication in store or online communication. We're trying to emphasize two things: performance and value.\nI'm not really interested in the current environment given that the accurate situation you describe of entertainment and a lot of other things. We want our ads to be as entertaining as they can be, but not to the extent that they compromise. Right to the heart of the matter, performance and value message. The third thing is, yes, you're right, we should be and are aggressively looking at ways to create more affordability through the innovation lines. And that's true. On package, can we identify formulas that are more efficient from a cost standpoint but still deliver ideally and deliver higher levels of performance?\nCan we? Are there opportunities from a packaging standpoint that allow us to reduce cost? Are there opportunities from a manufacturing standpoint that allow us to reduce cost? All of those things we're very, very actively focused on and will continue to be. I think there's a misperception that occurs sometimes which is our fault, that when we talk about superiority, we're talking about premium.\nThat's not how we think about it. We think about it as having the best offer in the price tiers in which we choose to compete. Someone earlier mentioned pricing ladders. We're very intentional in trying to fill out those ladders so that there is an affordable proposition for different groups of consumers. So thanks again for asking that question. It's a very important one.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, everyone. Jon, you will be missed, and congratulations to you, Shailesh, and the respective families. As you correctly pointed out, this is a family company to families. Impressive results all over these years. I have a question and two specific clarifications on fiscal 2026 guide for both of you, I guess. Jon, starting over the years, my question is like more stepping back from a strategic standpoint. You mentioned that consumer health is an area that you felt P&G was punching below its weight. Did that change? And if not, would that be the growth be organically mostly or M&A based?\nSecond, on the clarification side, within your fiscal 2026 EPS guide, are you adding back any tariff mitigation efforts to the $800 million headwind after taxes, and would that mitigation become the upside for the midpoint if that's not included? And related to that, the two-year restructuring savings, were they added to the fiscal 2026 or do we mostly feel on a net effect on the fiscal 2027? Thank you.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'll let Andre handle those last two questions. Andrea, and then I'll come back to your question about personal healthcare.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAndrea, I think the short answer is. The midpoint of headwinds and mitigation is included in the midpoint of the guidance range. And on the productivity savings, they will materialize beginning second half of the fiscal year. But we're working through the program details, and as you can appreciate, execution will have to be diligently planned. So as we gain more visibility to the CPS by market, by legal entity, by project, we will give you more visibility to the timing of those savings. Rough cut would say building up towards the second half of the year.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nOn your question on personal health care that continues to be a strong focus area for us. It's been a business that's performed extraordinarily well even in the context of a light cough cold season. In the most recent year. We have been clear that there is significant opportunity for organic growth within that portfolio. And the last several years, double-digit growth has been driven by organic innovation and geographic expansion.\nSo that will continue. We also have been clear that there are a couple of categories that we currently compete in where we might be interested in acquisitions that they offer an opportunity to significantly improve the growth rate and margin structure through both revenue and cost synergies. That's what we did when we purchased the German Merck portfolio of OTC products.\nWe're very happy with that acquisition. It's paid out extremely well. It's built capability both from a supply standpoint and a commercial standpoint. So we'll continue analyzing opportunities that are presented to us. I expect that the future of personal health care will be bright and will be driven both organically and opportunistically through some level of acquisition.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question today will come from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nAnalyst, TD Securities\n\nOkay, we're going to finish strong here. Congrats, Jon. But I'm hoping to ask the same question. Everyone's asking a little more directly about the US. Are you going to be raising prices more this year in the US than you did in fiscal 2025? I would think it would be a necessity, given the tariffs. Then secondly, you know, there's a very wide range in your guidance for top line. Is there also a wide range of scenarios on the pricing embedded in that? I would think that would be where there would be a high degree of uncertainty given the moving target on tariffs. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey, Robert. So the pricing on those SKUs that are impacted by tariffs largely in combination with innovation is mid single digits in the US. That's about 25% of our SKUs that are impacted. That is not vastly different from what we typically take with innovation. A couple of points higher to account for the tariff impact that we can't offset with productivity. If you average out the pricing across the entire portfolio, we're looking at about 2.5% broadly in line with where inflation is trending. Also not too disruptive.\nAs I mentioned before, the variability on the pricing is part of the range on the top line. If the pricing is holding, if the pricing is supported by the tariffs actually being implemented, then that supports the upper end of the guidance range. If the pricing needs to be rescinded or spent back because the tariffs are coming in differently or for other reasons, that would lead to the lower end of the guidance range. So it's built in. I don't think it's the biggest variability in the top line. I think it's one factor. I think the underlying consumer strength is still the biggest unknown that we're dealing with here.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAll right, I think that brings us to a close here. I want to just make a couple comments reflecting on the conversations that we've just had. First, as Andre already said, I just want to make sure it's registered. Our ambition is to deliver at the midpoint to the high point of these guidance ranges.\nI believe though I've always been guilty of this, that there are more opportunities than there are challenges. And that's both in the near term, but certainly in the long term. I tell our board of directors all the time, this company has never faced more challenges than it currently does. That's the bad news. The good news is we've never had more opportunities than we currently do.\nGetting ahead of ourselves in that regard in month one of 12, particularly given how things developed through last fiscal year, is probably not a prudent approach and probably doesn't serve you well. So that's kind of the summation of this overall discussion. We'll stay close and make sure that you're learning as we're learning. We have many opportunities to do that as the year progresses. I have tremendously enjoyed, in most instances, my interactions with each of you and your constituents. You play a very important role in helping people make very important decisions in their lives.\nYou're a steward in many cases for the resources that they utilize to support their families. So I thank you. There's been a lot of thanks and congratulations extended my way, but I offer the same in return and we all look forward to interacting with you, hopefully narrowing these ranges as we learn more and having a very good year in the process. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its investor relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I will start with an overview of 3rd quarter results and spend a few minutes on strategy and innovation. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 25, and then we will take your questions. Third quarter results on both the top and bottom lines were heavily impacted by consumer and retailer volatility during the quarter, primarily in the US and Europe. As we highlighted at the CAGNY Conference in late February, our approach in the face of this near-term volatility is to protect our investment in our long-term health of our brands, innovation, and demand creation. We are adjusting our fiscal year guidance in accordance with this approach. Organic sales for the quarter grew 1%. Volume and mix were in line with prior year, and pricing added one point to organic sales growth.\nGrowth remained relatively broad-based across categories, with 7 of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales for the quarter. Personal health care was up high single digits. Skin and personal care grew mid-singles. Fabric care, oral care, feminine care, grooming, and hair care were each in line to up low single digits. Family care, baby care, and home care were each down low singles. Organic sales in focus markets grew 1%, and enterprise markets grew 2%. Organic sales in North America grew 1%. The change versus the 4% growth trend over the last five quarters was driven by a combination of lower consumer offtake across our categories, which is evident in published market data, and trade inventory reductions, which we discussed at CAGNY. One encouraging sign is that we returned to shipment levels consistent with the pace of consumer offtake in the month of March.\nAnother positive sign is that market share held up well within the quarter. Europe focus market organic sales were up 1%. As our categories saw similar impacts from consumer confidence, France continues to be a significant headwind with organic sales down high teens in the quarter versus the base period that grew 20%. We have now annualized the implementation of the EGalim 3 law in France and will have easier comps going forward. Greater China organic sales declined 2%, a modest step up on the path back to growth in the region. Notably, SK-II in Greater China grew double digits behind strong consumer response to the super premium LXP innovation and the supporting marketing campaign. Underlying market conditions remain relatively soft, but we are encouraged by the progress we're seeing in several categories. Latin America led the enterprise markets, delivering 6% organic sales growth despite difficult consumer dynamics in Mexico.\nEuropean enterprise markets grew low single digits, and the Asia, Middle East, Africa region declined low single digits. Tensions in the Middle East have remained high and continue to put pressure on markets and US brands. Global aggregate value share was down modestly versus prior year, with 27 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.54, up 1% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 3%. Core gross margin was down 30 basis points, and core operating margin increased 90 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 100 basis points. We maintained strong margin investment levels supported by 280 basis points of productivity improvement, including adjustments to planned compensation awards given year-to-date trends versus our targets. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 75%.\nWe returned nearly $3.8 billion of cash to share owners this quarter, $2.4 billion in dividends, and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. Earlier this month, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners. This is the 69th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 135th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. To summarize the third quarter, the team managed well with.\n\nOperator\n\nPardon me, ladies and gentlemen. It appears we have lost connection to our speaker line. Please stand by while we reconnect the speaker line. Thank you for your patience. One moment. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. I have reconnected the speaker line and will ask the speakers to continue. Andre?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nApologies for the technical issue here. We are picking up at the strategy comments. We're not exactly sure where we got disconnected, but we can follow up in the Q&A section if there are any elements on the results that we need to pick up on. On the strategy side, now is the time for investment in and flawless execution of our integrated growth strategy. Delivering superiority across every part of our portfolio is the path to growing categories, providing value to consumers and customers, and creating value for share owners. We must do this across all value tiers where we play, all retail channels, and all consumer segments we serve, as we've done in the past. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio across markets and brands to strengthen our ability to generate US dollar-based returns in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice.\nWe will continue to accelerate productivity in all areas of our operation to fuel investments in superiority, mitigate cost and currency headwinds, and drive margin expansion. We will continue our efforts to constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry, changing, adapting, and creating new ideas, technologies, and capabilities that will extend our competitive advantage. We are empowering our highly capable and agile organizations that are ready to step forward to create value for all consumers, customers, and share owners. These choices, portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization reinforce and build on each other, and we remain confident in our strategy and its importance, especially in difficult times, to drive market growth and deliver balanced growth and value creation. A long-term focus on the strength of our brands, business, and categories is the best way to position ourselves for stronger growth when the economic climate and consumer confidence improves.\nThis starts with strong innovation plans. We have many new innovations that launched in the fall or are hitting shelves now. We recently launched our best whitening toothpaste ever, Crest 3DWhite Deep Stain Remover. The new formula works in just one day to dissolve the bonds that lock stains in your teeth and better prevent stains from reoccurring. Deep Stain Remover is off to a great start and is driving Crest market share growth in the US toothpaste category. We launched our most advanced power toothbrush, Oral-B iO10, early last year, and we followed up with iO2, the first iO designed to help consumers trade up from a manual toothbrush to a power brush. The combination of premium and entry point innovation is working well, with Oral-B Power Brush share up 50 basis points in the US We also have strong innovation across all price tiers in fabric care.\nTide Oxi Boost Power Pods are launching this quarter. Oxi Boost includes two times the Oxi power to provide Tide's most powerful clean. In addition, we have innovation at the mid-tier of our detergent price range. Gain Odor Defense detergent lifts away tough odors at the source and includes 40% more freshness ingredients. Finally, Tide Evo, our new laundry detergent developed on our breakthrough functional fibers platform, continues to exceed expectations in our now expanded Colorado test market. Evo offers superior cleaning performance in fully recyclable packaging with no plastic bottles or water. In the doors where Evo is present, it's proving to be highly incremental to category growth despite its premium pricing. Great progress across all criteria we set for the test market, including manufacturing readiness.\nWe have many other innovations launching right now in grooming, upgrades to blades and razor handles on GilletteLabs and Venus, and Venus now includes shower hooks with all razor handles. Tampax now has a 20% longer leak guard braid for improved leak protection, and Always Pocket FlexFoam, full-size protection in a tiny pack, making it incredibly convenient for on-the-go use. Pampers has innovation coming in essentially every element of its portfolio over the next year. Home Care has inovation this spring on Febreze, Dawn, Cascade, Mr. Clean, and Swiffer, more than we have time to discuss in this call in detail. We chose to maintain our innovation plans during the early stages of COVID. We did the same in the early stages of the severe inflationary cycle a few years ago.\nIt's unclear how long this period of consumer softness will last, but we know P&G will be stronger if we keep innovation across every part of our portfolio and keep investing to drive consumer interest and demand in our categories. As market leaders in many of our categories, we know our retail partners rely on P&G innovation to drive market growth. In difficult times for consumers, this role is especially important and offers a unique opportunity for our brands to differentiate themselves in terms of both performance and value. We will continue to drive productivity and make smart choices in all areas of cost to ensure we're mitigating headwinds along the way. However, we won't cut to save the bottom line for a quarter only to lose momentum for the year. We will maintain a long-term view, which leads us to our revised outlook for fiscal 25.\nAs we've highlighted, we continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer, competitor, retailer, and geopolitical dynamics, and now tariff impacts. I'll talk through each of these, and I'll get to tariffs in the end, so please bear with me. On the top line, we now expect organic sales growth of approximately 2% for the fiscal year. With one quarter remaining, this deducts to fourth quarter organic growth of 0.5% to 4.5%. A key determinant in where we land within that range is underlying market growth. Regardless of whether markets remain weak or accelerate back to prior growth levels, we expect to grow our brands modestly ahead of underlying markets. On the bottom line, our outlook is now for core EPS of $6.72 to $6.82 per share for the fiscal year.\nThis equates to core EPS growth in the range of 2% to 4% for fiscal 25 versus prior year core EPS of $6.59. This guidance deducts to a range of $1.37 to $1.47 for the fourth quarter. Our outlook for commodity costs remains unchanged, forecasting a commodity cost headwind of approximately $200 million after tax, which equates to a headwinds of $0.08 per share for fiscal 25. Since last earnings, foreign exchange rates have eased modestly. We are now estimating a headwind of approximately $200 million after tax, which equates to a headwind of $0.08 per share for fiscal 25. We continue to expect lower non-operating income benefits for the fiscal year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter base period includes the gain from the divestiture of our Vidal Sassoon brand in China.\nWe're now forecasting only modest headwinds from net interest income and expense, and an effective tax rate roughly in line with prior year. Combined, these below-the-line items are around $0.04 headwind to core EPS. We continue to forecast a justified cash flow productivity of 90% for the year, and we have plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion in common stock, combined returning $16 to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook assumes a range of $100 to $160 million in BT tariff impacts in the fourth quarter, or $0.03 or $0.05 per share. This assumes current tariff rates hold for the full quarter when products and materials inbound to the US and other tariff-impacted markets will be affected, and when those goods will be recognized in our P&L as finished products are sold to retailers.\nCurrently, the largest US tariff impacts are coming from raw and packaging materials and some finished product sourced from China. While China accounts for just over 10% of total imports exposure to the US, the size of the tariff rate makes the cost impact more substantial. The largest impact of responsive tariffs on US exports is from the finished products shipped from the US to Canada. We'll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impacts, including sourcing flexibility and productivity improvements. We also need to consider some level of consumer pricing in affected categories and markets. The guidance we've shared today is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major supply chain disruptions, store closures, or tariff changes are not anticipated within the guidance range.\nTo wrap up, we're pleased with the results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging and volatile environment, and we remain focused on excellent execution of our integrated dynamic and market constructive strategy, innovating and investing to drive market growth and balance top and bottom line growth and value creation. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have a question, please press star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, please press star followed by two. Our first question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much and good morning. So, Andre, during the quarter, you guys had definitely discussed the retail inventory destocking in the US, and that that kind of morphed into more of a real slowdown in consumer takeaway. And you'd also flagged similarly changing behavior in Europe. US consumer confidence metrics are very weak. Europe, to a lesser degree, but still below consensus forecasts. So just with that context, would love to get your latest read on consumer behavior in these regions and kind of what are you planning to do differently? I know you talked about all the innovation, but to support revenue growth and market share is things that feel like are probably going to get worse from here from a market growth standpoint. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Lauren. Yeah, good to start with the consumer. If you go back, as you rightly say, when we were at CAGNY, which was kind of around mid-February, the consumption data that we saw through mid-January, which was the data that we had available at that point in time, still looked stable. We highlighted the inventory drawdown that we saw, but consumption levels were stable. Since then, the consumer has been hit with a lot of volatility: market volatility that impacts their portfolios, their 401(k)s, volatility in the economic outlook, uncertainty on the job market, volatility in terms of mortgage rates expectations, all the divisiveness and nationalistic rhetoric that we saw around the world, and uncertainty on tariffs and the impact on prices and availability of goods. So, I mean, the consumer has been hit with a lot, and that's a lot to process.\nSo what we're seeing, I think, is a logical response from the consumer to pause. And that pause is reflected in retail traffic being down. It's also reflected in somewhat of channel shifting in the search for the best value, shifting into online, shifting into big-box retailers, and shifting into the club channel in the US specifically. All of that put together means consumption levels are down in both Europe and the US. The US has been growing over the past 12 months around 3% in terms of value consumption. What we've read through February and March was closer to 1%. Similarly, the European consumer has been at about 3% over the past 12 months. And again, that consumption level now is down to about 1%. Glass half full. P&G is growing or holding share.\nEurope volume share continues to be up in the most recent reading, about 30 basis points. U.Sy shares are holding. Private Label shares in both regions continue to trend down, and actually accelerating downwards in Europe. So the message we draw from this is that superiority of our brands, delivering performance to consumers in uncertain times, is still value to consumers. They are choosing our brands, and so we take encouragement to double down on our strategy because we see that as the only viable path through this level of volatility that we're experiencing. We're doubling down on innovation. We're doubling down on superiority.\nWe are heavily focused on driving productivity and heavily focused on ensuring our organization can be as agile and externally focused as possible to be close to consumers and close to markets so that we can grow the business for all those jobs to be done that consumers don't want to fail in. What we focus on as well is a longer-term outlook. You've heard us talk about our determination to remain invested in the business, which we think is absolutely critical. So even if we saw volatility in the short-term consumption, we are determined to remain invested both from a brand-building, innovation, and go-to-market perspective. We continue to focus in a volatile environment on the two to three-year balance between top-line and bottom-line growth. That's what you'll see us talk about and execute.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, Andre. I guess I had a question just around how we should begin thinking about approaching modeling forecasting for 2026. And so maybe can you give us a little bit of perspective on, one, just category growth rates now as we're kind of thinking about exit rates into 2026? And then as we're looking at this year as a base, so fiscal 2025 as a base, how much more incremental levers are there to pull as we look at next year in terms of either offsetting the incremental cost of tariffs or if demand begins to be subdued? So just trying to understand from you just what are some of the factors you're looking at and that we should consider as we begin to kind of look at our model out past the end of fiscal 2025?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Good morning, Bryan. Stepping back at the global level, obviously, the reduction in consumption levels that we saw in the US and in Europe have an impact on global growth rates. Over the past 12 months, we have seen global growth in the range of 3.5%. Value growth, that is now down to roughly 2.5%. We expect markets to return to the 3% to 4% growth rate, but it's very hard to predict, as you can appreciate, with the current volatility we see in all of those factors I mentioned in response to Lauren's question, when that's going to happen.\nSo we're really taking a longer look at our plan over the next two to three years, ensuring that as markets return over that period to 3% to 4% growth, do we have sufficient investment ability to maintain superiority and expand superiority across all of those category country combinations we deem strategic. So category growth, question mark, in the short term. Midterm, we expect it to return to 3% to 4% growth rate. The levers for us are the same levers that we talk about in our integrated strategy. I think the tariff impacts that are visible to us right now at a growth level are in the range of $1 to 1.5 billion. So it's not immaterial.\nFor us to offset those in the short term, we have to consider productivity, which we will double down on, and we have a very strong productivity plan over the next three years that I feel very bullish about. We have to continue to invest in innovation and superiority and enable actually more investment in those areas in the short term and the midterm. That innovation that we are pushing out will have to carry some level of pricing. If you think about the short and midterm, with the uncertainty around tariffs and honestly, the difficulty to adjust sourcing, formulation, or even asset location, I think it's clear that productivity, innovation, and pricing are probably the short-term levers that we will employ. But looking at all the other levers, including formulation and sourcing changes, obviously as well.\nThe fact that we are close to our consumer for the majority of our production, I think, is a benefit for us. But the number in and of itself, obviously, is still not immaterial, so we'll have to continue to figure out how to do that. So the one piece I would want you to take away is assume category growth rates return to normal levels, and we will focus really on a glide path over two to three years to deliver low to mid singles in terms of top line and mid to high singles in terms of EPS growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYes, hey, good morning. So, Andre, you talked about the innovation pipeline strength and the importance of maintaining the momentum on that front. I haven't parsed through all of the math implied in the updated guidance, but could you just talk about whether, kind of net of everything, the level of investment that you're putting behind that innovation and behind demand building going forward has changed at all in this updated outlook? And then whether or not the magnitude has, given what you're seeing in the consumer, has the nature of that investment changed at all in terms of advertising versus trade or the like, just how you're thinking about the support that you're going to put behind that innovation as you go forward? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Steve. Investment levels are always adjusted both across regions, markets, categories, brands, and periods because the plans are obviously year-over-year different. If you look at fiscal year-to-date investment levels, specifically on media and advertising, we are flat in terms of percentage of sales. And as we said, we have a very strong innovation pipeline in the balance of the year, which we intend to focus all investments on. What exactly that dollar spending is, we'll adjust as we see the plans unfold. But the one thing that is very clear to us is we continue to be committed to fully support the innovation across Q4. That innovation is best supported with strong communication. So media, advertising to our consumers is the primary vehicle of investment. I don't view us shifting the mix between advertising and trade promotion.\nTrade promotion always plays a role as we launch new innovation in driving trial, but it's mainly focused on visibility, and we have a pretty good track record of creating visibility on new innovation without deep discounting. The market so far is responding the same way. You see relative stability in terms of promotion depth and frequency both in Europe and in the US. We certainly have no interest in changing that other than driving trial and awareness of the new innovation that we're pushing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. So, Andre, you highlighted doubling down on superiority in innovation in this environment. It's obviously served P&G well in recent years. With the consumer pressure points we're seeing, if we do start to see more consumer trade down, can you discuss how you see P&G's position today versus past cycles? And then also, have you seen any specific geographies, product categories, or private label shares picked up so far? And you touched on this earlier, but what's P&G's market share performance been in some of those areas if, in fact, you're starting to see that dynamic play out a little more? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Dara. I think we continue to view ourselves as well-positioned to serve the consumer even as their value equation might shift. We have a way better portfolio in terms of vertical value offerings from a brand perspective, and we have a very broad portfolio in terms of price points and pack sizes across all channels around the world. And that's true from China to Europe to North America. You also see in our innovation that we are focusing innovation on all value tiers in all categories. As we're innovating on Tide, we're also innovating on Gain. As we're innovating on Swaddlers, we're innovating on Luvs and Baby Dry.\nAnd that's actually a good part of the innovation that is launching over the next few months is focused on driving innovation across all value tiers, so that we can serve consumers and have relevant offerings that are superior versus the relevant competitive set at each price point and price tier. So well-positioned there, but I would say the teams are paying extra attention to ensuring that we have the innovation calibrated with the consumer environment in mind and the support models calibrated in the same way. That, I think, has enabled us through all of these periods of volatility. If you go back pre-COVID, COVID, inflationary cycle with 8%, 10% of pricing, we've grown share or held share across all of those periods. And even in this current period, with obviously some variability, if you look at a month, we continue to hold or grow share.\nPrivate label shares continue to trend down, which is not the answer, but it is a good indication that in a more value-conscious environment, that portfolio is holding up well. We are able to serve consumers across all channels. You see, I mentioned the shift in the US specifically towards online, big box, and club. Again, in those channels, we're able to serve the consumer, hold share, and grow categories. And if the consumer to grow towards dollar channel or discounters, we're able to have the relevant offerings there. So, long answer, not an easy task. The team is very focused on ensuring we have the appropriate value proposition across all of those vectors. And so far, we've proven that we can do that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Filippo Falorni of CITI. Please go ahead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a broader question around brand sentiment towards American brands around the world. Are you seeing any signs other than the Middle East, where I know it's been a pressure point for you guys for quite a few quarters, of some anti-American brand sentiment around the world? And specifically on China, we're seeing some improvement there of the SK-II back to growth, as you mentioned. Do you see some risk on the other side of the China business, particularly the Olay and the air care business potentially going forward, and maybe just some expectation on the growth forward in China? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Filippo. We have not observed in data that there is an impact in terms of nationalistic consumer behavior. We obviously are paying very close attention to social media or trade activation. While we see some noise in markets like in Canada, none of that has yet resulted in any change of consumption behavior that we can attribute to any of those dynamics. In many of the markets, and I would argue actually in most of our markets, our brands have been present for 10, 20, or 30 years. If you ask consumers, they view them as local brands that they grew up with, not as a US brand that is foreign to them. I think that's the case in Europe. That's the case in China.\nAnd even in Canada, where probably the noise level is the highest, consumption has held steady at 4% on a base of 6% in the previous year quarter. So nothing to report on that front yet. In China, actually, we're very encouraged because we're seeing in a still tough consumer environment, SK-II accelerating to 11% growth in the quarter, behind strong innovation on the super premium tier of LXP. But even the core tier is responding very well to our communication strategy focused on brand superiority at Pitera. Our new department store counters are working extremely well. Olay has picked up and returned to growth in the current quarter. So we now see 2% growth on our Olay portfolio, behind innovation on anti-aging, following the trend that the market has made from the shift the market has made from toning benefit to anti-aging benefit.\nOur baby care business continues to do well. If you look at Europe-focused markets, the one structural element we need to keep in mind is France is heavily impacting the Europe-focused market results. The EGalim promotion law was impacted on 1 March 2024 and led to heavy loading both from a retail and from a consumer standpoint in that period. If you take that loading effect out, Europe-focused markets would have grown 5% in the quarter. So, a long way of answering the question, that's not coming through in any of the data that we're seeing, either qualitatively or quantitatively. We'll continue to keep an eye on it, but our best response to all of this is to have the best brands available with the best value equation, with the best superiority for our consumers and our retail partners.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on one area and then ask a broader question. But regarding Andre, your response, I believe, to Bryan's question, and you're not giving fiscal 26 guidance today. Fully get that. But the glide path back to category growth rates, I think you had said something like over the next two to three years. Does that imply that you'd be a bit below historical category growth rates for the foreseen future, including into fiscal 26, or was there an expectation that category growth would perhaps return to those levels into fiscal 26 with a bit more pricing? I fully realize that there's no crystal ball, but it was kind of this question to clarify the very near term versus the medium term. And if I could, your investor day was very much focused on opportunities in North America and in Europe.\nCoincidentally, those are the areas where category growth has slowed. So are you thinking about adjusting your playbook at all in light of category development, or is it still very much aligned with the strategy from a geographic standpoint that you laid out at investor day? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Chris. Our playbook aims to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth over a two- to three-year period. We won't hit that algorithm every quarter. We won't hit it every year. We look back over a two- to three-year period. We want to deliver that algorithm. That is true for how we approach the next two- to three-year period. As you said, there is no crystal ball. We don't know what the category growth rate is going to be given all of the volatility that the consumer is facing, and we won't guide today. I think the only logical conclusion is a wide expectation in terms of possible outcomes. That's how we have to plan. That's what our teams are getting ready to deal with. I think that's the only insight I can give you.\nUncertainty, which we face, means a wider range of planning and possible outcomes. In terms of the opportunity that we have highlighted during investor day, what we're currently seeing only means that capturing those opportunities is even more important today than it might have been six months ago. So the $5 billion growth opportunity we've highlighted in the US by driving household penetration of our biggest brands, Tide, Cascade, Bounty, for example, all only in 40% or less of US households is a huge opportunity by further segmenting the consumer base and being more targeted in serving them, communicating with them, and driving trial and repeat across those brands. Further doubling down on new innovation, new jobs to be done that consumers have not yet widely adopted. We keep talking about fabric enhancers. That's still 30% household penetration or below, and even only 40% to 50% of load penetration.\nDriving power oral care as an opportunity to increase oral health for consumers across the US with the launch of iO2, converting manual toothbrush users to electric toothbrush users. All of those opportunities are still there. We still see $5 billion of growth that we can capture. And that's why we want to double down on our investment because that's really focused on capturing those growth opportunities. And the same is true for Europe. So nothing's changed. And that's why you see our almost stubborn commitment to not letting go of innovation, not letting go of investment, and not letting go of our collaboration with retailers to serve the consumer even better in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, Andre. So I was hoping to get some more perspective on international market growth. You touched on the Europe-focused markets being up 1%. You outlined the impact France is having, Latin America up 6% despite challenges in Mexico. So just would be curious if you could unpack category growth in those regions versus maybe market share performance. And then you outlined some of the shifts in consumption that are happening in Europe in your response to Lauren's question. I'd be curious what you're seeing in terms of consumption across Latin America more broadly. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe're very pleased with the Latin America results, maybe to start there, Peter. 6% organic sales growth is a great result with a very strong base. I think it was 17% in the base period. Brazil growing 8%, Mexico growing 6%. And that's with Mexico's consumers probably as volatile as the US consumer. So we feel good about category growth in the region. We have Argentina now as an import market, which I think stabilizes the region from an overall growth perspective. And I see, again, strong innovation and focus of both our Brazil teams and our Mexico teams as the biggest markets in the region to drive innovation, drive category growth, and help accelerate that growth rate even further. From a China perspective, the message hasn't changed. The market is still flat to down across our categories.\nWe are making progress within that: -15% Q1, -5% Q2, -2% Q3. But I do believe that, again, recovering China will take time and won't be a straight line. The message there hasn't changed. We focus on steady progress on our growth rate and bringing more and more of our categories and brands into positive territory. But China will continue to be volatile in our mind. The rest of the world, again, I won't have much more intelligence other than to say we saw growth rates slow from 3.5% to 2%, 2.5%. Structurally, we believe that the world will return in our categories to 3% to 4% growth. As I mentioned in response to Chris's question, we don't have a crystal ball.\nSo the only way to deal with the uncertainty that comes with the current consumer growth rates is to focus the organization on the strategy and plan for a range of outcomes.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning. I just had a quick question on guidance. Based on your update, it still implies an acceleration in Q4 versus Q3. And then just thinking about that in the context of softer consumption trends, just wondering if there could be further risk there or just maybe what gives you the confidence that things might accelerate a bit in Q4 versus Q3. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Bonnie. You're right. We are planning for a wide outcome in Q4, which is reflective of the comments I just made in terms of market growth assumptions. That really is the highest level of variability that we see. The current guide, as I had in the prepared remarks, has a wide range from 0.5, I think, to 4.5 in the next quarter, which is indicative of the uncertainty we see from a consumer behavior standpoint. The one uncertainty we believe that has impacted us in Q3 that is no longer part of the range that we're providing is inventory. We feel that consumption is now moving again in line with inventory. Consumption is moving in line with shipments. So no inventory destabilization in the quarter.\nBut we also don't assume that that inventory that we lost in Q3 will come back because we believe it's an outcome of the consumer shifting into channels that are more inventory efficient. So the guide for the quarter is wide. We believe it appropriately reflects the range of outcomes we see and appropriately has risk protection for that range.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Stifel\n\nYes, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to your commentary, Andre, about the shifting consumer in terms of where they're purchasing. You called out club. You called out more mass channels. I don't think that's especially new. But I guess, are you seeing acceleration in the most recent quarter? That's sort of one. And then two, if not directionally new, meaning that the consumer has been shifting to Walmart or Costco or club channels. In general, does that change the way that the company approaches selling into those channels from a price tag or volume versus price mix standpoint? Has that evolved over the last couple of years? And how do you see it kind of changing from here, especially in the context of what you called out more recently? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Mark. No, you're exactly right. The trend is not new. We've been seeing this shift into big box retailers, online, and club for a number of quarters, and we've been talking about it. So our portfolio, as you rightly say, is well positioned to play with the consumer moving and maybe accelerating the move a little bit over the past quarter into those retailers. Our brands are well positioned. Our pack sizes and price points are adequate, and we get great support across the entire trade landscape. So we're not worried about it. What I think maybe some of the elements that have accelerated that is a little bit less support in the drug channel because of the difficulties in the drug channel, and that accelerates, I think, the move into some of the other channels we're talking about.\nBut as you rightly say, I don't think it's a fundamental shift other than it gives us, I think, more clarity to explain why we see an overall inventory reduction in Q3 and why we believe that inventory will likely not come back because as we see more business from those channels and those retailers, they tend to be more inventory efficient, which is really the only structural element where it's relevant. Our brands are positioned well in all the channels, and that's part of the job. We have to make sure we're there wherever the consumer decides to go.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nSenior Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. So Andre, first a clarification on the $1 billion to $1.5 billion impact that you quoted from tariffs. Is that, I'm assuming, obviously, that's an annualized impact and most related, as you said, to raw materials sourcing from that 10% that you talked about, exposure to China, and some of the exports to Canada that you alluded to. Is there any, when we think about then, if that's correct, the real question that I have is that at the midpoint of that impact, say $1.25 billion, that would be around 3% of annual costs, and pricing needed to offset that would be broadly one or two points. And as you said, you're going to use productivity, as you always had leaned into productivity to offset other inflationary costs in the past.\nSo it does not seem hard to mitigate that from a value-accretive, also value-accretive, innovation that you have. So how we should be thinking more long-term, more medium-term, the mitigation efforts that you're going to have, understandably not in the Q4 fiscal, but going to the medium term?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Andrea. Yeah, the $1 to 1.5 billion before tax is the impact that we are estimating based on what we know today. That means the tariff rates that have been announced and enacted both in the U.S .and in all other markets in response to the US tariffs. Exactly as you say, that's about 3% of cost of goods sold, about 140 to 180 basis points margin impact. The point, this is not an average discussion, though, right? Because the impact is on certain SKUs, on certain brands, and certain category country combinations. So when we average this out across the globe, the numbers that you quote are correct. But if you look at certain market category combinations, the numbers in terms of pricing are way more significant than we would have to take net of what we believe we can deliver in productivity and other mitigating factors.\nSo that's exactly the work that the teams are doing now. And that's why we keep all of the tools on the table. We will start with productivity. We will look at sourcing changes and formulation changes, which typically take longer. We will look at pricing with innovation, and we will look at straight pricing. All of those elements are on the table, and we're working through them right now. But it's important to understand this is an average global number. The number that you have by SKU, by category, by brand, by market is very different. And that's where the decision needs to be made, right? That's what the consumer will see. And that's where we need to make the interventions. But at an aggregate level, it's manageable. We'll just need to work through the details across the portfolio, which is exactly what the team is doing.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. My question is also around the projected tariff impact, the $1 to 1.5 billion. And if you could just compare and contrast to the $160 to 170 in Q4, was there some forward buying or other factors that are resulting in a smaller impact in Q4 versus your anticipated full year run rate? And then just following up on that, wanted to know a little bit more in terms of the pricing plans to mitigate the tariff impact because the categories that sound like they're hardest hit, for example, like tissue towel, are categories that have seen a more substantial deceleration and typically have significantly higher private label exposure and competition overall. So as the teams do their work in terms of trying to figure out how to go about pricing, if you could just talk in terms of the specifics around categories, that would be great.\nThank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Olivia. The Q4 impact of 100 to 160 million BT is just one month because the way the tariffs flow, they are an inventoriable cost. So they flow through our variance holding policy, which means we really only have one month of impact within Q4. So then you take that times 12, you get straight to the 1 to 1.5 billion before tax that we are quoting. Look, on your pricing plans, what you're describing is exactly the discussion we have on every pricing move. There's commodity effects, there's foreign exchange rate effects, now there's tariff effects. So working through exactly what is the right plan by brand, by market, what combination of pricing over what period of time is the right answer, that's a very complex exercise, and it really can't be answered at a market or at a category level.\nLet us do the work. As we do that, it will be reflected in our guidance range. This is not new to us. This is what we do. Generally, we are doing it well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. First, in the press release, I believe you stated that in China, you were taking pricing in skincare. So I'd like to understand a little bit the logic behind that, given that it's a tough market, and what gives you the confidence to get that price? And is it, in fact, sort of strategic pricing that you need to be higher to get the high-end consumer interest? So that's first. And then second, I'd love to understand a little bit more about how, from your perspective, the major retailers are thinking about what's going on with the significant changes in trade policy, how they're thinking about their suppliers in that context, their supplier supply chains. Is there any indication that they are looking to change who they're working with, given various people's supply chains? And are they looking at private label differently?\nYou had mentioned that Private Label continues to be flat or trending down. Is that because the consumer, for whatever reason, doesn't want Private Label because the brands are marketing so well and the value is so strong? Or are the retailers, at least in your categories, de-emphasizing Private Label? What's the logic behind that? Maybe in that context, touching on diapers. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Robert. China skincare pricing, just very quick answer, it's behind innovation. We have strong innovation out on Olay. We talked about the super premium innovation on SK-II. And that's just congruent with the business model. You innovate, you price, and you provide better value and better outcomes for the consumer and drive market growth. I won't speak for retailers, Robert. Many of the aspects of the question you asked, I think, are better asked of our retail partners. What I will tell you is that our vision of partnering with our retailers, as we talked about supply chain 3.0, integrating our supply chains because we are close in terms of manufacturing location, warehousing locations to their supply chains, I think, is an advantage that played out pre-COVID, throughout COVID, throughout the inflationary period where sourcing became more difficult and more expensive. And I don't expect that to change.\nI think we appreciate our retailers' willingness to engage with us to build a better supply chain. I think they appreciate our ability to provide supply chains that are stable, reliable, and cost-efficient. I think that is the focus for us. I won't speak to their Private Label strategies. I think we will see them articulate that and play it out. What our job is to provide the best possible branded offering in the store, which is why we continue to focus on investment innovation across both the product as well as go-to-market, and supply chain.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kevin, your line is live and may be muted.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, PNB Paribas\n\nRookie mistake. Sorry about that. Morning, guys. Andre, question on emerging markets here, which have slowed a bit. Can you just comment broadly? And I know some of this is China. We've talked about the Middle East before. But what was really sort of the key growth driver for the company now has slowed pretty precipitously. Can you comment on industry growth rates in key emerging markets? How much of this is slowing? How much of this is industry-specific versus how much of this might be more Procter-specific? Because we don't have a great deal of granularity on that. And then sort of more forward-looking as we think about fiscal 2026, what is the company's sort of expectation, broadly speaking, in terms of growth rates for emerging markets? So any color there would be helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble",
    "content2": "Morning, Kevin. If you look at the growth rate of enterprise markets in our portfolio, it has been, as you say, it has been a great contributor to the company results: 6% last year, 15%, 10%. So a great run. The market dynamics are different by region. As I mentioned before, Latin America, we feel very good about the market. Growth rates are stabilizing. We are doing well within the key markets. So I continue to see Latin America contributing mid- to high single-digit growth rates to our portfolio. Enterprise markets in Europe are heavily impacted by Turkey. And you've seen the situation in Turkey, both from an economic standpoint and from a political standpoint. That continues to weigh on enterprise markets. But if you look outside of urkey, again, growth rates are stabilizing.\nI feel good about our ability to continue to drive growth at average portfolio rates or above from Europe enterprise markets. Then the last region, Asia, Middle East, Africa, within the portfolio, the biggest driver continues to be the Middle East. But if you look at markets like India, we are profitable, and India is driving mid-single-digit growth very nicely. We have local production on the ground. We have R&D capability on the ground. The market gets better every time we look at it. So again, we feel very solid about growth opportunity there. But it's enterprise markets. They are volatile by default. That's why we manage them as enterprise markets. And the same volatility we see at the moment in our focus markets, for sure, is to be expected in enterprise markets. So I won't give you a 26 guide.\nI will tell you the same thing I've mentioned before. If there's any conclusion from the current visibility, it's going to be a wide range.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today will come from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. I guess a couple of things. There's so much conversation about Macro, but if I recall, the innovation pipeline was so much heavier in the back half than the front half of this year. So with everything that's going on, whether it's Macro or tariffs, that sort of thing, is it slowing the pace of innovation rollouts or expectations from contribution of those innovations? And I suppose I say that in the context of sometimes when the consumer is under pressure, they tend to not want to try new things. And I'm just wondering if that sort of changes the calculus on your plans for rollouts.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Kaumil. I don't think it does. As we said, we are committed to continue to drive innovation into our categories. And for us, we continue to believe it's the most important driver of category growth and therefore getting that incremental consumption. We've highlighted it as a big opportunity in focus markets, both Europe and North America. I think the trick here is simplicity of the proposition. What you don't see us do generally is try to drive new SKUs and make the category more complex. What we're trying to do is restage propositions and be very clear on what the incremental benefit and incremental value for the consumer is, supported by our retail partners. If we do that right, it is category accretive. And again, you heard us talk many times about SKU complexity and simplifying the shopping experience for consumers. And you're right.\nNow is the time more than ever to go down that path and work with our retail partners to ensure that all the noise that is irrelevant for the consumer, as expressed by being a small fraction of the sales while being a bigger part of the shelf, all that noise needs to go away so the consumer can more clearly see the benefits of the strong innovation that some of the biggest brands are bringing to market.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Robert Moskow of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thanks. Andre, I wanted a little more clarity on the commodity inflation guidance. It stayed the same at $200 million. Is that including the tariff impact or not? I think that's the first question. And then also, we've noticed that resin prices are down a lot since the start of the year, probably in the mid-teens related to crude oil. Is it possible, as you head into fiscal 2026, that there actually is this crude oil benefit that flows through and helps reduce the cost of the tariffs that hit your P&L?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Robert. The commodity inflation number that is quoted, the $200 million, is excluding the tariff impact. So for clarity, we kept it separate. So we see $200 million impact from commodity inflation and 1 to, sorry, $100 to 160 impact, growth impact from tariffs. And that impact for next year is $1 to 1.5 billion BT. Again, growth impact of tariffs. The commodity impact for next year, I won't comment on. We always forecast at spot. So whatever the spot is at that point in time when we lock our plans for next year will be underlying guidance. And if anything, I'll give you the same answer. The range will be wide.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from Korinne Wolfmeyer of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nKorinne Wolfmeyer\n\nVP and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to touch a little bit on how you feel about the broader agility of your supply chain, and how quickly and easily could you shift things around to try and mitigate the impacts here in more of the near term. And then also, can you just touch a little bit on what your conversations with both your suppliers and also maybe the retail partners have been on the potential to kind of help absorb those tariff costs? Any context there would be great. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning. Yeah, the first part of the answer I'll give you is we are, I think, in the favorable position that the majority of our supply chain is close to our consumption. We've made those investments very deliberately over the last seven, eight years. We invested more than $10 billion just in the US to locate production close to the U.S. consumer, created jobs, and I think we're seeing the benefit of that, which was enabled by a more competitive tax environment in the US. So we're starting from a good place. Supply chain changes require certainty. We don't want to make short-term sourcing changes or short-term formulation changes unless we know what the environment is we're dealing with.\nSo we're really waiting for certainty at this point in time for us to make decisions because those decisions are generally, A, they have lead time of multiple months, sometimes years, and B, reversing them have similar lead times. So any knee-jerk reaction doesn't make a whole lot of sense. On our conversations with retail partners and suppliers, I won't comment. They are ongoing in any environment. And again, we had a lot of volatility over the last six, seven years. So certainly, the communication lines are always open. And again, you'll see our plan develop over the next few months as we get closer to the year and hopefully have a bit more visibility.\nThat concludes the call for today. Thank you for your time.\nI hope you see and feel our commitment and our conviction that the business model, the strategy across the portfolio we've chosen, the focus on superiority, the focus on productivity, and the strength of our organization has us both committed and convinced that we will be able to deliver on algorithm over a two- to three-year period while maintaining investment in the business for growth with our retail partners and the benefit of consumers in the near term and the midterm. That conviction will not change. We will manage our business in the short term and the midterm along those lines. Thank you for your time today, and we'll be available for any other questions you might have. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections as required by Regulation G. Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nScholten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of second quarter results. Jon will add perspective on our results and strategy, and we'll close with guidance for fiscal 2025 and then take your questions.\nQ2 results were largely in line with our going in expectations despite a high degree of volatility within the quarter. Ultimately acceleration in organic sales growth, EPS growth, strong cash return to shareholders. Organic sales for the quarter grew 3%, volume contributed 2 points to organic sales growth, mix added 1 point, and pricing was roughly in line with prior year. The top line results were better than anticipated. In early December our team was able to fully overcome the two-week outage of our global transportation management system provider and support strong late December customer orders ahead of early January merchandising events. Growth was broad-based across categories with nine of 10 product categories growing. Organic sales for the quarter. Fabric Care was up double digits, Home Care and Skin and Personal Care were up mid.\nin personal health care, hair care, oral care, feminine care, fabric care, and grooming grew low single digits. Baby care was down low single digits.\nOrganic sales in focus markets grew 4% and enterprise markets were in line with prior year. Organic sales in North America grew 4% driven by 4 points of volume growth over the last six quarters. North America has grown organic sales 7%, 5%, 3%, 4%, 4%, and now again 4% on volume growth of 3 to 4% each quarter. The region delivered broad-based market share growth this quarter with 8 of 10 categories holding or growing volume share and 8 of 10 categories holding or growing value share. Europe focus markets. Organic sales were up 4% driven by 4 points of volume growth over the last six quarters. Europe focus markets have grown organic sales on average 6% on volume growth of 3%. Latin America and European enterprise markets each grew low single digits and the Asia, Middle East, and Africa region declined low.\nIn Greater China organic sales declined 3% while down versus prior year. This is a solid step forward in our second largest market from a 15% decline last quarter. Notably, SK-II in Greater China grew 5% with strong growth during the 11.11 key consumption period and modest growth in travel retail. Underlying market conditions remain soft and we are trending back toward growth in Greater China.\nGlobal aggregate value share was in line with prior year, with 28 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.88, up 2% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, Core EPS increased 3%. The quarter included roughly $0.02 per share of incremental costs to manage through the transportation services disruption, almost entirely in cost of goods sold. Core gross margin was down 30 basis points, and core operating margin declined 80 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin decreased 50 basis points. The quarter included strong productivity improvement of 260 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 84%. We returned over $4.9 billion of cash to share owners this quarter, $2.4 billion in dividends, and $2.5 billion in share repurchases.\nTo summarize, results accelerating organic sales growth, solid core EPS growth, and cash return to share owners, keeping us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges. Overall good performance in what continues to be a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. Over to.\nJohn.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Andre. Our team continues to execute our strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over the past six plus years pre-COVID, during COVID, through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle, and through geopolitical tensions.\nThey've now delivered 26 consecutive quarters of 2% or better organic sales growth averaging 5.5% organic sales growth over those six and a half years. We've now delivered eight and a half fiscal years of 2% or better core earnings per share growth averaging nearly 8% over that period. This is the type of long term.\nSorry, turning my page here. Balanced top and bottom line growth. We strive to deliver solid, consistent growth over time.\nAs we expected heading into the fiscal year. First half results were below the guidance ranges we set for the full year, and while recent consumer trends and FX rates make the balance of the year more challenging, we continue to expect stronger results in the second half. Andre will discuss this more in the guidance update. We remain committed to the integrated strategy that has enabled our strong results and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. We highlighted many of the reasons we're confident in the strategy at our Investor Day in November. If you weren't able to attend, I encourage you to listen to the replay on our IR website.\nTo recap, we remain very disciplined in our portfolio choices, including some moves over the past year to strengthen our ability to generate US dollar-based returns. We're doubling down on superiority across all five vectors. No single vector of superiority can carry the day itself. It's all five together. The innovation plans to create and extend superiority across the business are very strong, and we continue to leverage recent innovations by driving more trial and household penetration.\nA few examples: Charmin Smooth Tear with its patented scalloped edge, the biggest innovation in toilet paper in 100 years, continues to drive Charmin volume and value share growth in the US.\nWe were first to launch the whole body deodorant sprays now across the Old Spice, Secret, and Native brands and we continue to drive trial in the growing segment. In this growing segment of the category, P&G US deodorant volume and value share are each up nearly a point over the last year. Dawn Powerwash continues to drive market share up more than a point in the US market. After nearly three years in the market, Swiffer PowerMop has become the largest innovation at Swiffer's history, contributing to 40% growth of the brand portfolio and driving a remarkable 35% growth in the category. We've launched our most advanced power toothbrush Oral-B iO 10 early last year. We followed up with iO 2, the first iO designed to help consumers trade up from a manual toothbrush to a power brush.\nEarly results in the US are very encouraging, and we're expanding iO 2 across major markets over the next several months.\nWe just launched our best ever Whitening Toothpaste Crest 3DWhite Deep Stain Remover. The new formula works in just one day to dissolve the bonds that lock stains to your teeth and better prevent stains from occurring. The early trial period for Deep Stain Remover is off to a great start. We're expanding Zevo, our insect killing sprays, mosquito and tick repellents, and insect traps with worry free ingredients inspired by plants' natural defenses against bugs. We're building distribution and trial and receiving very strong consumer ratings and reviews. Tide Oxyboost Power Pods have just launched online with a great response from retailers and customers. Oxyboost includes two times the oxy power to provide Tide's most powerful clean. Oxyboost Power Pods will be available in stores soon, and we'll be following up quickly with additional innovations in laundry detergents and fabric enhancers.\nFinally, Tide evo, our new laundry detergent developed on our breakthrough functional fibers platform, continues to exceed expectations in our Colorado test market, surpassing our year one performance goals in just the first 12 weeks after launch. We're progressing through the last phase of supply chain readiness, and we'll be assessing our expansion plans in the coming months. There are many more examples we could share considering the next six months.\nOf innovations across Tide, Gain, Downy, Febreze, Dawn, Cascade, Mr. Clean, Pampers, Luvs, Tampax, Always, Always Discreet, Bounty, Old Spice, Crest, Gillette, and Venus brands. And that's just in the US. I hope you can see this is one reason we're confident in our prospects going forward. We're improving productivity in all areas of our operations to fuel investments in superiority, mitigate cost and currency headwinds, and drive margin expansion. We've extended our visibility to productivity improvement with each business unit building three-year cost savings master plans mirroring what we've done for years in our innovation program. We're driving constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends, technologies, and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage.\nWe've designed and continue to refine and strengthen P&G's organization structure so that it enables P&G people to be fully empowered, agile, and accountable, focused on business outcomes to deliver the greatest value creation.\nWe call this an integrated strategy for a reason. Each part of the strategy needs to be delivered. It's not a menu to pick and choose from. Each element is incredibly important. The real advantage comes from being able to do all of these things at the same time. The strategy is inherently dynamic. It adapts to the changing needs of consumers, customers, and society. It demands that we not sit still. We continue to believe our best path forward is to double down on this integrated strategy, operating with a focus on driving market growth, creating business versus taking business to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to discuss.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGuidance. Thank you, John.\nSo with half of the fiscal year complete, our guidance ranges for fiscal 2025 are unchanged and remain consistent with our long-term algorithm we've highlighted. We continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging. From input costs to currencies to consumer, competitor, retailer, and geopolitical dynamics, on the top line, we are maintaining our organic sales growth guidance in the range of 3% to 5%. We continue to expect the markets in which we compete to deliver local currency sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for the year, and our objective remains to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth of these markets.\nOn the bottom line, our core EPS guidance range for fiscal 2025 remains at growth of 5% to 7% versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This guidance equates to a range of $6.91 to 7.05 per share.\nOur outlook for commodity costs remains consistent with our most recent guidance expecting a commodity cost headwind of approximately $200 million after tax, which equates to a headwind of $0.08 per share for fiscal 2025.\nSince last earnings, foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us. We are now expecting a headwind of approximately $300 million after tax, which equates to a headwind of $0.12 per share for fiscal 2025. We continue to expect lower non-operating income benefits this fiscal year and a somewhat higher tax rate versus the prior year. Combined, these additional headwinds amount to $0.10 to 0.12 to Core EPS on top of the commodities and FX headwinds I mentioned. With projected softer market growth and stronger foreign exchange headwinds, we currently have good visibility towards the lower end of the top and bottom line guidance ranges. However, we will continue to push all levers in our control to offset these headwinds that are largely not in our control.\nWe expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year, and we have plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to 7 billion in common stock combined, returning $16 to 17 billion of cash to share owners for the fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. Now I'll hand it over to John for closing.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThoughts. We're very pleased with the results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging and volatile environment. A good first half of the year and a stronger outlook for the second half. We remain focused on excellent execution of our integrated dynamic market constructive strategy aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retailers. With that, we'll be happy to take your.\nQuestions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have a question, please press star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, please press star followed by two.\nYour first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning guys. I just wanted to drill down a bit more short term into organic sales growth for the back half of the year. Given some of the volatility over the last year. You've talked historically about the OSG split between the robust 85% in country mix versus a lagging 15% the last few quarters. Can you just give us a bit of update on the performance in fiscal Q2 in each of those buckets? Do you think you're on track for continued improvement in the 15% in the back half of the year as you look versus Q2 and also just sustainability of growth in that 85% that's stronger, presumably driven by the US and Europe.\nThanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Dara. Thanks for the.\nQuestion. I'll take a crack at.\nIt. And John, you jump in.\nSo if you look at Q2 and I apply the same logic that we've been using to explain the divergence of the majority of the business versus some of the tougher markets, 85% of the business so comprising of the US, Europe.\nLatin America, the Latin America and Europe enterprise markets, that 85% continues to grow at around 4%. What has improved is the 15%. So the performance of the balance of the markets, mainly the Asia, Middle East, and Africa markets, but the significant improvement in Greater China. So China was down 15% organic sales in Q1 and was down, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, only 3% in Q2. So we see encouraging momentum towards recovery and hopefully more neutral picture as we go into H2, that's exactly what we're expecting as we go into the second half of the year. We expect the US to continue to grow at the pace that we've seen in Q2 and Q1. We expect some increased momentum across Europe and Latin America specifically as comps ease versus the base period.\nAnd with that, if we are, if we are combining hopefully a little bit stronger growth in North America, easier comps in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Middle East, and Africa. And if China continues to move towards a more neutral contribution to sales growth, that would actually allow us to be at the midpoint of organic sales growth guidance, maybe a little bit higher. Conversely, if we saw weakening across some of the core markets of North America and Europe or we saw China returning to more negative territory, that would move us to the lower end or slightly below the current organic sales growth guidance. Our base case, Dara, to summarize, continued strong performance around 4% in the 85% of the business, continued recovery on the.\n15%.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning. So Andre, I think you were kind of running through projected performance for P&G's business, but I was hoping you could also comment on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and dynamics. I think in December you guys had flagged a little bit of a softening in the consumer environment in the US as a maybe it's something that sticks, maybe it doesn't, but we'd just love to get a read on that. And same in Europe, sort of the consumer dynamic, not just your own performance and market share.\nTrajectory.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYep. Hey Lauren. Generally I would describe the consumer in our categories, which are again non-discretionary and very focused on performance, as stable. In Europe specifically, the market continues to grow at around 4% in focus markets and in double digits actually in enterprise markets. Our ability to continue to grow ahead of that, I think, is visible in the volume share numbers. We are growing volume share about 50 basis points in focus markets and 60 basis points in enterprise markets. Inflation is down in Europe to about 2%. We see a relatively stable environment which we expect to continue going into H2. We are investing in strong innovation in H2 to benefit from that stable consumer environment. In the US the current quarter has been a bit more volatile in terms of phasing of consumption.\nWe saw very strong consumption in October, driven by hurricanes and by port strikes, easing off a little bit in October, in November, and then coming back in December. So it was volatile. But when I step back, I would characterize the situation very similarly to the European consumer. Stable in our categories, market growth continues to be around 4%. Volume growth continues to be around 3%. And again, our job is to encourage consumption in our categories with strong innovation and communication, which we're doing and continue to do across half.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nTwo. The only thing I would add to Andre's comments is in terms of reflecting on consumer behavior.\nWe're also seeing continued flat to declining private label shares in both the United States and in Europe. So that again is relatively reassuring in terms of the stable consumer that Andre rightly referred.\nTo.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go.\nAhead. Thank you.\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI guess, Andre, I'm a little surprised that your currency outlook as it relates to the impacts on the top line didn't move off the -1% call you had in place as of October even as the after tax profit impact stepped up by the $300 million. So maybe you could just talk about any key moving parts there and whether you've assumed further currency movements or if the full year now effectively assume spot rates as we've seen in the last few weeks. And then relatedly I guess I'd love a little bit more discussion of the productivity and pricing levers you have.\nAvailable to you as an offset to those dynamics, and whether you see any limitations to implementing them over the balance of the year. I'm asking that in the context that historically Q3, Q4 gross margins stepped down sequentially. So, I think your guidance assumes some fairly strong operating leverage over the balance of the year year in SG&A. But just wanted to see if you could clarify those moving parts. Thank.\nYou.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Steve. I think.\nWe are forecasting right now at spot rates as we always do, both on the P&L side and the organic sales growth side, and Europe, we're seeing high volatility in currencies obviously that are moving on a daily basis based on commentary. So we'll reserve our ability to update here. But for now we're reflecting spot rates. The.\nImpact of foreign exchange rate will mostly hit in the second half, so we saw a lot of the commodity impact in the first half, and the corresponding impact of FX will be mostly in H2, that is built into our guidance logic that we've communicated. Our ability to deal with foreign exchange, as with any headwind, is a combination of productivity, which we feel very good about for the year across all productivity buckets. So we're confident in our $1.5 billion productivity guidance on cost of goods sold and the $2 billion guidance overall, including SGA, and pricing levers. Pricing is probably most pronounced in enterprise markets where we see strong foreign exchange rate exposure, but it's going to be a combination of both. All of that is baked in at our guidance commentary. But again we'll watch this closely because there's a lot of volatility in.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThis, as you know, just on pricing, Steve, the.\nYou know our business model, as hopefully was reflected again in my comments this morning, is heavily innovation-based. It's at the heart of everything we do and that's the primary enabler of modest amounts of pricing as we move forward. If you look at our history again as a source of potential confidence and our ability to continue to execute modest amounts of pricing, even as Andre said, in the focus markets pricing has been a neutral or positive contributor to our top-line growth for 19 of the last 20 years and for 54 of the last 57 quarters.\nAndre Schulten mentioned, we have very strong second-half innovation.\nPrograms across markets. And so that should enable us to continue to put some upward pressure on the top line. Again, modest, but we're in a pretty good position with all of that.\nInnovation.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Spillane of Bank of America. Please go.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, guys. So just a question or maybe two on China. One, just the 3% in the quarter, just how did Chinese New Year's impact that? So I guess, is that kind of reflective of consumption or is there any timing shift, shipment versus consumption? And then maybe just more broadly, Jon, you know the market's changing.\nDoes it create opportunities? Are you looking now to kind of use your position as a position of strength and expand in China while the market is soft? Just curious if the change in the marketplace at all has changed the way you're thinking about the market.\nStrategically.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI can. Hey, Brian.\nSo I think that the China results are not impacted by heavy phasing within the quarter. There was phasing in China on the timing of pre-shipments for 11.11, but that kind of evened out across the quarter. So the progress is really what we had anticipated. We're getting into easier comps. Part of that, part of that is SK-II is returning to growth in China at 5%, which is encouraging to see. And the last point I'll make is on the core brands. We're making progress. We are innovating on hair care across Pantene, Head & Shoulders. We're innovating on fabric care, we're innovating on Olay, and that is driving progress. We are carefully investing in the fastest growing channel in Douyin to ensure that we create value there. But that allows us to now grow share in that channel.\nAnd the last element is, I think, the go to market interventions that we've made. We talked about in the last call where we improve our collaboration and synchronization with our core distributors is paying dividends. So all of that is moving in the right direction. I want to be clear, I don't think China is out of the woods. This will continue to be difficult, it will continue to be volatile as reflected in my guidance commentary that volatility can drive us to the midpoint or the lower end of the guidance. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but it's good to see the trend going more.\nPositive. You make a very, very good point on taking advantage of significant change that's occurring in the marketplace, both with regard to consumer behavior and with regard to.\nCustomer behavior and channels.\nWe intend to do exactly as you described, which is take advantage of those changes. There are a couple things that I just want to bring a little bit more focus to.\nThat are very, very important. One is, if you look at our distributor channels largely feeding the wholesale markets and smaller grocery stores.\nThey were being.\nPaid based on total P&G business. And we've changed that. So they're now being paid by category. So they have to deliver against each of the categories.\nThat we have products in order to be fully compensated. That might not seem like a big deal. That's a big deal. It changes behavior significantly.\nWe've also moved. We've taken advantage of all the changes that are going on to move our China operations even closer to, for example, how we manage things in the US or focus Europe in terms of end to end, meaning that the categories own everything from the front end of innovation all the way through to the customer discussions. That wasn't fully the case.\nSay, two years ago, even a year ago.\nSo those are big changes. The third big change is really reorienting the conversation that we're having internally and externally with.\nOur customers to one of market growth and demonstrating how we can be the biggest drivers, their strongest partners in driving that market growth, which is something that everyone wants badly. So that's another example of taking advantage of the current situation to become even stronger and more relevant to our customers. So thanks for asking that question. I think it's an excellent one and it's something we're very much focused.\nOn.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go.\nahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning everyone. Hope you're doing well. I wanted to get just some perspective on the input cost environment. You know, I recognize you maintained your outlook for the $200 million after-tax headwind, but we've seen some volatility across some of your key raw materials over the past few months. So, Andre, can you maybe just give us or unpack what you're seeing or expecting across your key cost buckets, and then just kind of looking at the first half impact in the full year guidance, you kind of alluded to this to Steve's question. Are you anticipating input cost deflation in the back half of the year when we think about our gross margin?\nBridge?\nThanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Peter.\nInput cost for us, obviously you can appreciate, is a wide variety of different materials and commodities. What I'll tell you which I think is most relevant for what you're after is any variation that we see now versus what we already incurred in H1, which is the majority of the 200 million impact that we are talking about, will likely not hit the current year P&L because of variance holding and because of our contract structures. Any major deviation in terms of oil prices outside of maybe transportation will impact H1 of next fiscal year. Most of our materials and commodities will impact the H1 of next fiscal year. So we feel relatively good about that end of the equation because it provides stability for the H2 where more of the volatility is again in foreign exchange rate.\nThat doesn't mean we don't look at our input costs carefully because as we said, we need to get ready to deal with it in the first half of next fiscal year. Which then comes to Jon's point on appropriately developing pricing plans with innovation productivity programs, et cetera. But the variability in the current year we believe is going to be.\nLimited.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. If we step back from the tone on the first quarter and then now the second quarter fiscal in regards to the range of guidance for both organic and EPS growth, is it fair to say you're feeling a bit better about getting to the midpoint on the top line but EPS more pressured given the increased headwinds and effects? I mean, I just want to understand how it changed and then if so, if any changes, it seems like your productivity is coming in or even your operating leverage is coming in better than anticipated or better than sized, if you will. And related to that, just a clarification about the disruptions you called out in December in one of your suppliers.\nI've been getting questions regarding there is anything in terms of selling sellout. I understand there wasn't anything material in the quarter either like catching up to that or anything that we should be aware of into the fiscal third quarter. Thank you so.\nMuch.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Andrea. So related to guidance, what I tell you is what I mentioned in the prepared remarks right at the moment. When you look at foreign exchange rate, you look at what we've delivered in the front half of the year.\nWe would say we have good visibility and confidence to the lower end of the guidance range both on organic sales growth and on Core EPS. That doesn't mean that we don't have a shot at delivering the middle of the range. As I said, if we continue to make good progress in China, if we continue to see some easing of the tensions in the Middle East and therefore business picks up, if Europe and North America continue to deliver, we have a good shot at the top line around the midpoint of the range and corresponding EPS. But at the moment, I would point you to the lower end on transportation management system interruption. Look, we wanted to give you guys visibility to what we were seeing.\nWhen we experienced the disruption, we saw a backlog of orders building up that would have been worth about 60 to 70 basis points of the quarter. We had assumed at that point that we would get rid of half of that backlog through intense work by the team to operate a backup solution and get us back on the main operating system. The team did way better. They were able to not only work through the full backlog and get us back on the operating system faster, they were also able to then process strong orders in late December. There is no impact quarter over quarter driven by the transportation management system outage. No unusual effect to consider there. Just great work by the team to get us through this without any impact on the.\nQuarter.\n\nOperator\n\nQuestion will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nAhead.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just first, a clarification on China, and apologies if I missed it, but I know that you're doing better, your brands are doing better, SK-II is doing better, but just wanted to get any commentary on the Chinese consumer, the health of the Chinese consumer as the quarter developed and then in through January. So, just a follow-up on that. And then, my main question is on innovation this year. You sound more upbeat, positive on this, and excited in terms of what you're bringing out in calendar 2025. Is there any way to quantify that versus prior years? Any way to think whether it's incremental shelf space or.\nThe expected impact of the business on the top and bottom line, so that we can kind of try to model that. Thank.\nYou.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Robert. From a Chinese consumer standpoint, as Andre intimated in some of his commentary, it's still a challenge. So that really hasn't changed significantly. There are signs though.\nOf some improvement. What am I talking about? So, for example, if we just look at the number of Chinese travelers to.\nKorea and Japan, it's up pretty significantly quarter on quarter. We actually see that reflected in our SK-II business in those countries.\nSo that would indicate, you know, more confidence and a willingness to.\nSpend.\nThe growth of SK-II itself. And actually consumption growth in that business is a little bit ahead of even our shipment growth, is an indication of confidence. That's, as you know, a very premium price product. But the broad swath of.\nSociety.\nIs not confident and is still.\nStruggling.\nThat's why Andre says, you know, we're not out of the woods. I agree with that statement and that it will take some time still to get to.\nYou know, dependable growth in.\nChina. The best data we have, Robert, to confirm what John was describing, past three months market in our categories in dollar terms is down 5%. Past 12 months was down 5%. So macro consumer environment pretty much stable, but not.\nPositive.\nRelative to innovation. I don't have a numerical.\nAbility to describe the strength of our, the innovation that's coming to market over the next six months vis-à-vis a year ago. But we are relatively, we have gained confidence in that program in part because of what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're seeing in terms of consumer response to, for example, the Tide evo test market in Colorado. Again, we've delivered what we expected to deliver in the first year. We've delivered in 12 weeks.\nWe're looking at the continued growth of some of our premium innovations in terms of household penetration and market share. I went through a litany of those examples earlier.\nAnd then of course there are some things that I'm not at liberty to talk about. But in general, your observation in terms of as you describe excitement or confidence in our innovation program is.\nStrong.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. You know, I guess thinking about your guidance this year, you know, if your organic sales come in at the lower end, as you kind of touched on its trends, decelerate further. And thinking about gross margin tailwinds, you know, likely moderating this year, curious how much flexibility you have to deliver on your EPS guidance range. And then in the context of that, do you see a potential that you might need to lower your reinvestment levels to deliver on your bottom line guidance? Any color on just how to think about your ability to continue to reinvest in your business. Thank.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Bonnie, when we went through the.\nYears with really.\nSignificant headwinds in terms of currency, commodities, and.\nFX.\nAnd.\nI'm talking there about a 55.0% reduction in our profit over a two-year.\nPeriod because of those.\nItems. We increased our spending on innovation. We increased our spending on commercialization of that innovation, and we grew earnings modestly. So that's our mindset, and I just described a strong innovation pipeline. We will fully support that pipeline.\nFrankly I don't think it will. But if that means that we come in a little bit lower, then that's what we need to accept and we'll be very transparent and clear about that if that were to be the case. Currently it's not. But.\nWe're going to continue to invest in both innovation and commercialization of that.\nInnovation.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, good morning.\nEveryone, I wanted to ask a little.\nMore color on the enterprise market. Business you talked about Europe, enterprise market still growing?\nSolidly. Maybe can you give a little.\nMore color on Latin America? How's the consumer general health there.\nIn key countries like Brazil and.\nMexico? And then on the Middle East.\nYou're starting to cycle easier comps? Is your expectation of a return to growth in H2 2025? Thank.\nYou.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Filippo.\nAmerica in aggregate delivered 3% growth in this quarter on a base of 17%. So quite impressive base period and continued growth across the markets. If you look at the consumers, I would describe Mexico as.\nMore difficult right now. But we are making good progress, and I have great confidence in the H2 plans that we are executing. And the same is true for Brazil. So my expectation would be an acceleration in Latin America, partially driven by the base becoming a little bit easier, but also given strong plans across those core markets. Europe enterprise markets were up a point in the quarter on a base of 8% growth. Encouragingly, we are growing volume share in enterprise markets in Europe by 60 basis points. Market growth still very strong. So we feel good about the market context, but also about our own ability to execute. I was just there with our CEO last week. The innovation plans are very strong. The go to market plans are very strong. The stores look phenomenal, and the opportunity is huge.\nThe profitability we have in both Latin America and in Europe enterprise markets allows us to remain fully invested in that innovation and the support thereof.\nAMA, Asia, Middle East, Africa. Look, the main driver here will be stabilization in the Middle East. We hope that that progress is sustaining and we can go from there. But I think it will remain a more difficult environment for us through the second.\nHalf.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi.\nEveryone, thank you for the question. I'd like to ask a few category-specific questions. I'll count this as one single category question if you'll allow.\nIn the family care business, the double-digit growth you saw, would you attribute most of that to timing with some sort of reversal expected in the next quarter? In the oral care business, it's the second quarter consecutive of low single-digit which is a bit below trend than what we've seen over the prior.\nOne year period.\nThen just in the baby business, you did highlight that you'll be making some merchandising investments. Jon spent some time on the resilience and longer term history of pricing at P&G as a contributor to organic sales. Clearly this is one of those categories that has been a bit more challenged over time and you're leaning in a bit more on investments. Can you expand on that a bit more? What drives those sorts of decisions and why now? So just those three kind of category questions and any kind of timing dynamics specifically with family care that we should be thinking about going into next quarter. Thank you very.\nMuch.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAll right, good morning, Chris. Let me take them one by one. So Family Care, we saw very strong shipments and very strong consumption. Most importantly, and as I mentioned, we had the port strike in October and we had a hurricane in October. Both of those led to pantry loading from a consumer standpoint. So there was some pantry upstocking clearly in October.\nWe also saw strong shipments in late December in anticipation of a January merch event. That's typical. We've had the same thing happen last year. But there is some increased pantry inventory. History would tell us that that consumers tend to hold onto that pantry loading for quite a while. We've seen this during COVID, and we always expected it would come out. It never did. So hard to say what the going impact is for the year. I think we've appropriately protected for that in the guidance. But it's pantry inventory loading, and we expect the majority of that will sustain through the next quarter. Orok, I would point you to two things. Number one, we're rolling out the full lineup of iO innovation, both iO 10 so up the value chain and iO 2 down to lower price points.\nAnd as we do that, I think the full opportunity across the power oral care business will become more accessible to us even in high penetration markets like in Europe. Lowering the price point with iO 2 will give us access to more consumers. We have a very strong marketing campaign building on the insight that power oral care removes 100% of plaque while manual brushing only removes 50% of plaque. That seems to resonate well with consumers. We also have the strongest paste innovation program including heavy focus on whitening where we had an opportunity to strengthen. So all of that gives me confidence that in the second half we'll see acceleration. Last point on baby, the reason why we want to make investments on baby both in communication and potentially in promo is due to innovation.\nWe have talked for a while about the opportunity to continue to innovate across the entire lineup. We've seen the Luvs Innovation now hit the market in September. We see sequential share growth on Luvs. So we want to give consumers the incentive and the opportunity to try those propositions while continuing to drive the premium end of the portfolio, Swaddlers and Cruisers. So it's really about a combination of combining innovation with strong in-store visibility and incentives to try, and strong communication to ensure consumers understand the benefit, all of those the foundation to create growth in baby, which is one of the tougher categories to do.\nSo.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. Sorry, a two parter here. First on China, you mentioned you expect continued normalization. So how much of this is category growth versus your market share improvements as you cycle less demanding comps? And I ask that because comps aren't particularly demanding in second half of course, but they do get a little less easy than the -15% that you're comping this quarter. And then just if you could talk briefly about the level of investment necessary to achieve your broader goals. Not specific to China, but but more broadly, does it have to go higher or can you leverage many of the brand support investments that you talked about in answer to a different question that you've already made.\nThanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Olivia, on China, what I tell you is.\nIt's a bit of both, right? We would expect some improvement as the market cycles to more forgiving comps, and we for sure would expect some improvement in our business. We talked about all the interventions we've made on innovation, on brand building, on go to market, including the distributor model that John elaborated on. So it's going to be a bit of both. Unfortunately, a bit of both means we have two hard to predict elements here. So we hope this is going to result in a more neutral organic sales growth contribution of China in the back half. But we also are fully aware that this could go either way from an investment standpoint. My take on this would be you see us adjusting based on the opportunity.\nWe have 30 basis points of incremental investment in H1 that was more moderate than what you would have seen in the base period or even the couple of years before. Some of the experimentation that we talked about and how far can we push frequency and reach, I think we concluded where it makes sense and where it doesn't. Make sense. We're now more clear on where that playbook goes, and we're focusing mostly now on optimizing within that playbook and improving content quality as we go into the H2 innovation. We will continue to invest where it makes sense, albeit probably at a slower pace than what we've seen in the last.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYears. Yeah, I would just add a couple things in response to your question, Olivia. Just one.\nNo, for clarity. The minus 15 isn't what we're comping from an index standpoint. That's a sequential number last quarter. So just for clarity on.\nThat.\nThe.\nIn terms of investments in commercialization and advertising and other forms of marketing.\nAgree with what Andre said. At the same time.\nHe talked about optimizing within that context.\nWe're making significant strides to be more profitable in the fastest growing categories or fastest growing channels in the country.\nWhile we will be opportunistic in investing, I expect as well we'll be saving.\nFor example, bringing.\nThe support of key opinion leaders in-house and utilizing some of our R and D resources for that activity. That saves a bunch of money. Our testing shows that it's as or more effective.\nSo it's not as simple as the level of reach and frequency, which are important, but it's also the cost of delivering that which we're working on to bring.\nDown.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks. Morning everyone. I'd like to pivot to capital allocation. Two-part question one: just updated thoughts on appropriateness of MA as a potential avenue to drive shareholder value and what looks like it's going to be a slower growth environment here. And then two, with respect to buyback, you know, consumer staples stocks, including Procter & Gamble, have underperformed the market. Valuations are below historical averages versus the S&P 500 in that sort of context. Has there been any school of thought internally to accelerate the pace of share repurchases as an avenue to drive shareholder value? So thanks for.\nThat.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'll take that, thanks, Kevin. I'll take the M and A question. Andre can add to it, and then move to your share repurchase question.\nThe answer is the same as it's been for some period of time here, which is that it starts within most of our categories.\nWe wouldn't contemplate acquisition being part of the growth model in kind of any economic environment simply because our market positions are typically the number one and sometimes both the number one and number two brands would preclude any acquisition of any size. There are two categories that we compete in that are attractive, that we like.\nThat are much more fragmented in their current constitution. We've talked about those before. One is personal health care. Another is skin and other parts of specialty beauty.\nWe.\nDon't. We're going to continue to.\nBe extraordinarily responsible.\nIn regards to pursuit of any.\nPotential acquisitions.\nWe don't engage in.\nHostile attempts. So basically assets have to be available, and then we have to be able to make sense of the purchase of that asset in a way that leaves us highly confident that we can create value.\nSo that's kind of it from an M and A standpoint. Before I turn it over to Andre, just one comment on share repurchase.\nAs Andre said in his prepared remarks, we're going to be returning between dividend and share repurchase $16 to 17 billion to shareholders this year. And as a general element of our capital allocation approach, I would expect significant cash return to shareholders to continue to play prominently. But with that, I'll turn it over to.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAndre, agree with everything you said on M&A, Jon. It's nice not to have to do it so we can do it if it makes sense. On the capital allocation. Kevin, nothing new here. We will continue to aggressively fund the growth in the business. We will continue to pay the dividend, likely increase the dividend. We will do M and A if we find a target that makes sense and is willing to play, and the rest goes to shareholders in share repurchase. That's really the simple logic that we apply. So it's an outcome rather than a.\nTarget. We don't, you know, there isn't a lot of, if you will, publicity about a special share repurchase program or, you know, a newly approved share repurchase program. Why is that? It's because we do it every year and we do it at the highest levels we can. As Andre said, we'll continue to pursue that.\nApproach.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nSenior Vice President, Stifel\n\nGreat, thanks. Morning everybody. Two quick ones. Just remind us on the approach to offset FX pressures where pronounced in places like Latam, where the dollar has strengthened via pricing. And then just returning to SK-II.\nIt seems a little bit like the performance was a little bit better than anticipated at an investor day where I think Alex had highlighted mainland China improvements would suggest obviously non-China a little bit weaker at the time. But your commentary would suggest otherwise. I guess is part of the improvement that the Chinese consumer perception of the brand. The geopolitical angle that improved, is it category improvement, is it both? Just any color there would be helpful. Thank.\nYou.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble",
    "content2": "Hey Mark. Good morning. Approach on foreign exchange is not different, so I just want to confirm we will. In enterprise markets mainly, there's a relatively good market discipline to price for foreign exchange rate. We want to be part of that, and we will combine pricing with innovation wherever that's possible and reasonable. That approach has worked well in Europe, enterprise markets, in LATAM, and across AMA, and we'll continue to follow that playbook.\nOn SK-II. You're right. I think it's actually good to see the brand strengthening with the China consumer. Number one, the whole dynamic of Japanese.\nBrand sentiment, I think, is easing. We most importantly, I think, have made significant investments in brand building as soon as we were able to get back into broad media coverage. We've done so with very strong amplification of the benefit and the efficacy of the product, which has worked well. We've upgraded our department store presence both from a counter standpoint and from a personnel standpoint to ensure that consumers can see us, find us at high-quality locations, and we've innovated. We've launched a super-premium proposition called LXP, which is doing very well in the market and again is contributing to the brand equity that we want to build and re-establish. So all of that is contributing. And the last element, I would say you can sum, I would tell you, is consumption is actually stronger than organic sales.\nSpecifically, in travel retail, the sales number is still negative, but the consumption continues to return. In line with Jon's earlier comments that we also see increased Chinese travel to different locations. So, generally, I think more positive outlook on SK-II, you're right, than what we would have given at investor.\nDay.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJust to build a little bit on that, the SK-II, you know, you never know how you've got this cross current of geopolitical sentiment and brand sentiment. As you rightly point out in your question.\nThe geopolitical dynamic, one of the ways we track that in terms of how it affects consumer behavior is through social media references, and those are down significantly in terms of. So, in other words, the number of positive comments is much higher than the number of negative comments, and that's continued. So yes, as Andre confirmed, that is an improvement. There is part of what's going on.\nBut the branding part that he also mentioned is an equally significant component, which he suggested. If you look at the premium skin care segment right now, SK-II is the fastest-growing brand within that segment. Now growth on SK-II is going.\nTo.\nBe.\nStrange to follow simply because of the base period dynamics. But, so the important thing to look at is what's happening to consumption trends quarter on quarter. And as Andre indicated, that's given us some.\nConfidence.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey.\nEveryone. Good morning. I know to Chris's question you answered for a few different categories, but if we can maybe dig in a little bit more on consumer health or healthcare, the comp was a bit easier, slowed down a little bit. If just anything in there that we should be aware about. Interesting to know.\nThanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThe trends there, you know, year to year, quarter to quarter are most impacted by the cough cold season, which really hasn't existed significantly at least through the month of December, which is the period of time that we're reporting results for. Currently.\nWe continue to be very happy about the growth delivery and the growth prospects for the broader PHC business and have brands outside of the cough cold space that are growing very well, by the way. Within the cough cold space, we continue to build share. So that's kind of what's going on, and I don't want to wish for illness, but that's less illness; we'll have slower growth, more illness will have higher.\nGrowth.\nOur family is contributing heavily to that growth by the way, and I'm sitting right next to.\nYou. That's not.\nGood.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nEdward Lewis\n\nConsumer Staples Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThanks, operator. Yeah, I just wanted to, I guess, look at the components of the focus on superiority plan and particularly on the consumer value side because I look at this core quarter; it's another quarter of its flat pricing. But if I look back over, say, the last three years, on average pricing is still up around 4%, and you're clearly getting positive volumes. So I wonder if you just talk to sort of what the consumer value side of the focus on superiority is telling you and whether you should have confidence about possibly being able to take more pricing sort of in subsequent quarters or years, with the evidence you're seeing from the data you're getting from the focus on superiority.\nPlanning.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI think we will be taking more pricing as we move forward, as we bring more, as we bring innovation that produces a more efficacious product and a better experience to consumers. The data that you referenced do indicate to us that we have the ability with that combination.\nTo continue contributing to the top line through a modest amount of.\n\nOperator\n\nPricing.\nThe next question will come from Linda Bolton Weiser of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\n\nLinda Bolton Weiser\n\nManaging Director, DADavidson\n\nYes. Hi. You've talked quite a bit about beauty in China, and certainly the SK-II improvement is contributing to that beauty improvement we saw in the quarter. But I was curious about the US side of it and whether what you're doing in Olay in the US, like focusing more on Regenerist as a core grower, if that's paying any benefits in terms of market share changes. And also just in beauty overall, it was a little curious why volume was actually down 1%.\nFor the whole segment for you, whereas volume had been sort of flat to up in the previous quarters. Thank.\nYou.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Linda, good morning. Look, let me start with North America, and it's similar. Beauty is a story of pockets of real strength and some pockets of opportunity, and that's true for North America and the globe. If you look at our antiperspirant and deodorant business in the US, it's growing 11%, and we're the number one whole body segment brand or have the number one position across our brands in that whole body segment. Personal care North America is growing 16%. So again, real source of strength: hair care in North America is up 3% on a base of 15. So real strength you point out, skin care is an opportunity. Skin care is down in North America double digits, and we are working to increase the innovation specifically on the jar business, the new innovation that we've launched.\nSo Olay Melts and Super Serum, those are doing very well, but they are just not big enough yet to offset the decline in the core business of jars where we saw some distribution changes in the club channel, but also I think a shift in consumer benefits base that we need to address. Similarly at the globe, same logic, strength on apdo, strength on personal care, and strength on hair care with an opportunity on skin care.\nAnd, again, same dynamic there. The only point I call out in China, for example, the Olay brand has been historically focused on tone benefits. The market is shifting more towards anti-aging or multi-benefit products, and so we've launched innovation there which is going in that direction. So, work to do on skin care, real strength across the other categories within.\nBeauty.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nRelative to your question on volume, Linda.\nChina.\nBeauty broadly has a higher presence in China than any of our other categories. We're still not out of the woods. We'll use that expression again on volume in China. While sales were 3%, I believe volume was -6%.\nI feel comfortable that's going to continue to improve. But when you look at beauty volumes, you have to realize that China weighting, which in many periods has been a very positive thing, but now presents a.\nChallenge.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Robert Moskow of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRobert, your line is live. You may be.\nMuted.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nSorry about that. Can you hear me?\nNow? They can hear.\nMe.\nYeah. My apologies. I wanted to ask about pricing in a different way. You know, this is the first quarter where pricing has been flat in many quarters. And is there any scenario you could imagine where pricing turns negative, or is there just a line in the sand here where, you know, that just won't happen? And then secondly on mix, you know, mix is positive, and I want to know what's driving that is a geographic. Can we assume that if Europe and US continue to outperform, will that be positive to your mix, or is there something within the categories that's driving instead?\nThanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI can start. John, jump in, please. So price is an outcome.\nThat consistently helps our organic sales growth number. I think John mentioned this. 54 out of 57 quarters. Positive contribution of price mix to our organic sales growth. And the timing of pricing outside of foreign exchange rate pricing or heavy commodity cycles, which has driven a lot of the pricing in the base periods, is mostly driven by our innovation cycle because we like and we tend to take pricing with innovation, and that just falls in different quarters. But generally that effect of modest pricing with inflation or foreign exchange rate in enterprise markets and pricing for innovation is driving that consistent contribution of pricing to our organic sales growth numbers and will continue to do so. What is driving mix here? I would focus less on geographic mix.\nI think what we're seeing is trade up within our categories, and you see that impacting the top line positively and impacting the gross margin line negatively. So as consumers trade up from liquid laundry detergent into unit dose or even within unit dose to the highest performing variants, they pay more per unit and we make more profit per unit. But mathematically the gross margin is lower. That's really the effect you see on the top line, positive effect of mix on the gross margin line, the slightly negative effect of mix, which is exactly what we want. So healthy dynamics on both. We expect both of those, the pricing dynamic with innovation and the mix dynamic to.\nContinue.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe're going to, you know, there is no straight line or red line on pricing. We're going to do what maximizes. We're going to make the choices that maximize value, and we'll be responsive to consumer needs in that context.\nBut I don't think in all the time that I've been working on this business I've ever thought about the question of, you know, would we have negative pricing? It's just not part of our thought process. We're focused on value creation. And as Andre said, pricing is kind of an outcome of that series of.\nDecisions.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question today will come from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nKorinne Wolfmeyer\n\nVP, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to touch a little bit on how you're feeling about or how your conversations with some of your retail partners have been going really across the globe. What are the confidence levels you're feeling with them? Are they still being cautious of inventory orders? Is that more normalized? And then how are you thinking about that heading into the back half of the fiscal year?\nThanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI just spent time.\nWith two of my counterparts who are CEOs of large European retailers.\nI had a top-to-top meeting with the largest customer outside of the US just yesterday. The entirety of those conversations is focused on market growth.\nAnd.\nNow as we pursue market growth, we can do that most efficiently. So working together, we call it one supply chain.\nTo figure out how. There's a lot of power in that because we used to optimize parts of our respective supply chains. But bringing that view altogether has produced significant results both for ourselves and our retail partners. Right now the conversation is very positive generally and focuses on the opportunities that we have in front of us.\nIn the US. So those, that's kind of Europe.\nIn the US in the retail environment currently you have some retailers who are doing extraordinarily well and some retailers and channels of trade that have more challenges. You can imagine that the conversations are slightly different across that universe of customers.\nBut in general.\nFollows the same pattern that I just described for.\nEurope.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAll right, I think that concludes our call. Again, in summary, good quarter, good progress across multiple geographies, cautiously optimistic with a lot of moving pieces throughout the second half. Thanks for your time today. We're available for any follow up questions, so please don't hesitate to reach out and have a great rest of the day. Thank.\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections as required by Regulation G. Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures.\nProcter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I will start with an overview of results for fiscal year 2024 and for the fourth quarter. John will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities, and we'll close with guidance for fiscal 2025 and then take your questions.\nFiscal 2024 was another strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies enabled the company to meet or exceed going in guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, cash productivity, and cash return to shareholders. All this despite significant market level headwinds that were largely unknown when we gave our initial outlook for the year. Organic sales growth for the fiscal year was 4%, our sixth consecutive year of 4% or better organic growth against a strong 7% comp in the prior year and in more challenging market conditions.\nGrowth was broad-based across business units with eight of 10 product categories growing organic sales home care, hair care, and grooming were up high single digits; oral care and feminine care up mid single digits. Fabric care, family care, and Personal Health Care grew low single digits. Skin and personal care and baby care were down low single digits. Focus Markets grew 4% for the year with North America up 5% and Europe Focus Markets up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down 9% versus the prior year driven by soft market conditions and brand-specific headwinds on SK-II.\nEnterprise markets were up 6% led by Latin America with 15% organic sales growth. E-commerce sales increased 9%, now representing 18% of the total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth continues to drive share growth for P&G. All-channel market value sales in the US categories in which we compete grew around 5% in fiscal 2024. P&G consumption grew ahead of our fair share of category growth, driving modest value and volume share growth for the year. We grew global aggregate value share. 30 of 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the year.\nImportantly, the share growth is broad-based. Six of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $6.59, up 12% for the year. Core gross margin improved 360 basis points, and Core operating margin increased 170 basis points. Over $2.3 billion of productivity improvements enabled by significant increase in investment in superior products packages, and brand communication to drive market growth. On a currency neutral basis, Core EPS was up 16%, and Core operating margin increased 250 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%.\nWe increased our dividend by 7% and returned over $14 billion of value to share owners, $9.3 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchase. Moving on to fourth quarter results, organic sales rounded down to 2%, volume was up 2%. Solid sequential progress, pricing was up 1% and mix was in line with prior year. Growth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions. Nine of 10 product categories grew or held organic sales in the quarter. Home care, hair care, grooming, and oral care were each up high single digits, feminine care up low singles, skin and personal care, fabric care, Personal Health Care, and family care were each in line with prior year, baby care was down mid singles.\nFive of seven regions grew organic sales, with Focus Markets up 2% and Enterprise Markets up 2% for the quarter. Organic sales in North America grew 4% with 4 points of volume growth and price mix in line with prior-year European Focus Markets. Organic sales were up 2% against a strong 12% comp in the base period. Volume was up 3%, price mix was down a point as the region has now fully annualized prior-year inflation-driven pricing. Latin America organic sales were up 8%, including high single-digit growth in Brazil.\nOf note, Argentina's overall contribution to organic sales for the region and the company were lower than in the last few quarters due to the divestiture of a portion of the business in March and a notable decline in shipment volume for the remaining categories. As was announced earlier this month, we have divested the remaining portions of our operations in Argentina. As a result, Argentina will be largely removed from our organic sales reporting in fiscal year 2025. Select P&G brands will still be available in the market through a distribution and licensing agreement with the new owner of the operations.\nGreater China organic sales declined 8%, underlying market conditions have remained weak, and the 618 key consumption period was down sharply versus prior year, just as we saw in the 1111, Chinese New Year, and Valentine's Day shopping periods. Also, brand specific headwinds have continued on SK-II due to its Japanese heritage. We expect general market trends and the dynamics related to SK-II to improve over time, though it will likely be another quarter or two until we return to growth.\nVolume trends in some European enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Russia have remained soft. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Global aggregate market share was down 30 basis points as we are now annualizing very strong growth in European Focus Markets; 25 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter.\nOn the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.40, up 2% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 6%, core gross margin increased 140 basis points, and core operating margin decreased 100 basis points. Strong productivity improvements of 250 basis points funding a meaningful increase in marketing investment. Currency neutral core operating margin decreased 60 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 148%. We returned nearly $4 billion of cash to share owners this quarter over $2.4 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases.\nIn summary, we met or exceeded each of our going and target ranges for the year. Organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash return to shareholders. Strong performance again this year in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. With that, I'll pass it over to John.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Andre. I'll start with a few thoughts on results before discussing the strategy. Our team continues to execute the strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past six years: pre-COVID, during COVID, through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle, and through geopolitical tensions. Organic sales growth of +5, +6, +6, +7, +7 and +4 over the last fiscal years. Strong earnings growth and gross and operating margin expansion. Very strong cash generation and over $96 billion of cash returned to shareowners over those six years.\nFor fiscal 2024, going in, organic sales guidance was 4% to 5%. We delivered 4% in a very volatile environment. Flat volume for the year with improving trajectory through the year, 2% growth in the fourth quarter. Strong volume growth in North America and Europe Focus Markets offsetting soft markets in Enterprise regions in China. Going-in Core EPS guidance of 6% to 9% delivered 12%. Core gross margin at a 17-year high with strong productivity improvement funding strong marketing investments.\nGoing-in cash productivity outlook of 90% delivered 105%, which enabled a 7% dividend increase, the 68th consecutive year of increase, and the 134th consecutive year paying a dividend. As Andre said, strong results in a challenging environment. To be very clear, there's still more work to do to continue improving areas in our control, which will be needed to offset the headwinds that are largely not in our control. We'll double down on superiority across all five vectors.\nWe'll double down on productivity up and down the P&L and across the balance sheet. We'll double down on enabling our organization to execute our integrated strategy with excellence to delight consumers and win in the marketplace to deliver the level of balanced growth and value creation results you and we expect. Our strategy is dynamic and sustainable. It adapts to the changing needs of consumers, customers, and society and is focused on growing markets, creating versus taking business, the most sustainable and typically most profitable way to grow a focused portfolio of daily use products in categories where performance drives brand choice.\nThe portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies. As you know, we are active managers of our portfolio. Over the last several years we've made some targeted additions and subtractions in that portfolio. We've adjusted our operating model in several markets. Each of these moves were made with a focus on long-term balanced growth and value creation. The second strategy element, ongoing commitment to an investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value holistically defined.\nLeveraging that superiority to delight consumers, grow markets, and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands and price to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete.\nWe've talked many times about the superiority driven market growth, share growth, and sales growth we've achieved with products like Tide and Ariel Pods, Downy and Lenor Laundry Scent Beads, and Dawn and Fairy, EZ-Squeeze and Powerwash. Two more examples. Oral-B iO Power toothbrushes deliver superior cleaning and delightful user experience. Superior communication includes the insight that manual brushes leave 50% of plaque behind, but Oral-B iO delivers 100% more plaque bacterial removal with its round head and removes plaque in hard-to-reach places.\nThis superior proposition is accelerating Power Brush trial and adoption, bringing new powerbrush users into the category. Driving high single-digit market growth of the powerbrush category. Double-digit sales growth for Oral-B Power and two points of Oral-B value share growth over the past 12 months. Native, our premium personal care brand, is delivering superiority across all five vectors and across multiple product forms including deodorants, body wash, shampoo, and conditioners. Superior performance with fewer ingredients and irresistible scents. Transparent labeling and clean white packaging.\nSuperior retail execution and strong retailer partnerships. Showcasing the full range of forms and scents. Premium positioning within the category providing superior value for the consumer. Looking for an offering with more natural ingredients, Native has driven a step change in market value growth for the US deodorants and personal care categories. From low singles to mid teens, Native sales have grown nearly 10x over the last five years to over $700 million in fiscal 2024.\nThird strategy element: productivity improvement in all areas of our operations in order to fund investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth, to mitigate cost and currency challenges, and to expand margins and generate cash. We delivered very strong cost savings in fiscal 2024. Visibility to more savings opportunities is increasing as the businesses continue to build their three-year rolling productivity master plans. We have an objective for gross savings and cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like Supply Chain 3.0.\nWe're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain end to end versus simply trying to optimize our respective pieces. One example: using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We're also using digital tools to optimize fill rates, forward dynamic routing, and sourcing optimization. $200 to 300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency, and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach.\nWe're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry. A willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends, technologies, and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building in-house. More of the media planning and placement activity using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery.\nLast but clearly not least, sorry, we've designed and continued to refine an empowered, agile, and accountable organization. An inclusive and diverse organization enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. Strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us, no reason to stand still as illustrated by the four focus areas that we've outlined previously. Number one, Supply Chain 3.0. It's delivering productivity. As you can see in the results, we're also driving improved agility, flexibility, scalability, and transparency in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nOptimized, sustainable, and flexible up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this is driving higher quality, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products and, of course, better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strengthen what is already the top-ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys.\nNext, environmental sustainability. Superior propositions for consumers, customers, and share owners that are more sustainable, driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations. Enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. The next focus area is digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers. Streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareowner value.\nOne example is the improvement we've delivered in ad copy qualification and media buying with proprietary digital tools we've developed and the digital molecule development work and fabric care. We've built similar tools to drive faster, cheaper, and better innovation in perfume which benefits almost every product category in the company. We're also digitizing more of our back office work processes to lower costs and drive efficiencies while delivering higher quality output.\nEach of these examples has obvious cost benefits, but they're also driving product and package superiority, superior brand communication to consumers, superior retail execution in store and online, stronger internal controls, and jobs that enable people to focus on higher order tasks with greater business impact. Last focus area: a superior value equation for all employees for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain, and develop the best talent and are best positioned to serve all consumers.\nThese four focus areas are not separate strategies, they simply strengthen our ability to execute our integrated growth strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption of the organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe there's merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy. Starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society, and share owners.\nAt the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. I believe in the capabilities and commitment of P&G people to serve consumers and to do this in the most responsible way consistent with P&G's values and principles. I'm excited about what lies ahead. Of course we'll continue to face challenges, but the future holds great promise. We have many opportunities ahead to grow markets, grow our business, and create significant value for our owners. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the New Year.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThank you, John, as we enter fiscal 2025, we continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer competitors, retailers, and geopolitical dynamics. As John said, we'll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers every step of the way. Our going-in guidance for fiscal 2025 is consistent with our long-term algorithm. On the top line, we currently expect the market in which we compete to deliver local currency sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for the year.\nOur objective is to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth in these markets. This translates to an organic sales growth guidance range of 3% to 5%. For the fiscal year. Apologies, I have my mic muted. On the bottom line, our algorithm calls for middle- to high-single-digit core earnings per share growth. Our core EPS guidance range for fiscal 2025 starts the year at 5% to 7% versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This guidance equates to a range of $6.91 to 7.05 per share, $6.98 up 6% at the center of the range.\nThis outlook includes a commodity cost headwind of approximately $300 million after tax and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $200 million after tax. Combined foreign exchange and commodities are projected to be a headwind of $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025 or 3% point drag on core EPS growth. In addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from several minor brand divestitures, and we expect a somewhat higher tax rate in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to 0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nWe expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to 7 billion of common stock combined a plan to return $16 to 17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. While we are clear-eyed on the challenges in the market and the work needed to continue to drive the business, fiscal 2025 guidance for top line, bottom line, and cash are each consistent with our long-term algorithm.\nA few items for you to consider as you build your quarter-to-quarter estimates on the top line. Please keep in mind that the July to the September period has the most difficult comp for the year, and many of the market-level challenges we've noted will not fully annualize or improve materially in our estimates until the second half of the year. On the bottom line, the foreign exchange and commodity headwinds skew a bit toward the front half of the year, and the back half comps include the benefit of the tax items and minor brand divestitures I mentioned earlier.\nThis outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. With that, I'll hand it back to John for his closing thoughts.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe're very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered over the last year and inclusive of prior years in a very challenging and volatile environment. The earnings power and value creation potential of the company are as strong as ever. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable balanced growth is to double down on the strategy. Excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have a question, please press star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, press star followed by two. The first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I guess the question that we fielded a few times this morning, and if you could touch on this a bit, just the last couple of quarters, it seems like organic sales have come in maybe slower or lower than expected than you were expecting at the start of each quarter. So maybe if you can touch a little bit on just what's developed, especially in the fourth quarter, maybe different than what you were expecting, and then if you can add to that also, just is that true for the market. So at 2% organic sales for this quarter, are we above, below, or in line with market growth? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Bryan. I'll start, and then John, I'm sure, will add some perspective as well. I'll start back where we kind of started the prepared remarks. I think we delivered a year where we exceeded or met all of our ingoing guidance metrics. Now the year wasn't linear as you highlight, and I distinguish two parts of the business, 85% of the business is performing right in line with expectations and right in line with what we would have expected throughout the year. We have strong growth in North America, 4% in the quarter, 4% volume growth in the quarter.\nEurope Focus Markets growing volumes at 3%. Europe Enterprise Markets growing volumes at 6%. Latin America normalizing to about 8% organic sales growth. So that part of the business where the trajectory is not impacted by significant external events I think is moving right along. We expected the normalization in price mix contribution. As we have talked throughout the quarters, if you look at the headwinds that we started to communicate in December, they are really still with us in and throughout the second half, and that's what's driving the volatility in the top line results.\nThose headwinds have accelerated in part, and honestly, in Q4 some of them developed late in the quarter. So when you think about China and SK-II, we were heavily impacted by 618, a weaker key consumption period in China, and overall market sentiment in China has not improved throughout half two. We had highlighted that we expect the China recovery to be slow and to take time, and I think that's playing out in the results we see in second half. The Middle East situation has not really improved.\nSo we continue to see developing stronger impacts on Western retailers in some of these markets. And while the team has implemented many interventions, the execution in store has been limited by some of these headwinds in the Middle East. The last element we saw a softening in Q4 on the Argentina volumes driven by the general circumstances in the market. Strong hyperinflation pricing in Argentina. So there was a softer contribution on organic sales growth in Q4 than what we've seen in Q3. If you step back though, the performance of the business and the way we set up for 2025 I think is very strong.\n85% of the business is developing right in line with what we would have expected. We're growing share in North America, the balance of the markets are growing volume which is really the shift we needed to see. Our growth margin is at record levels, our productivity is very strong. That has enabled us to remain fully invested from a media perspective and from an innovation perspective. And so going into the year we feel all the structural elements of the business are strong. Now, what is important to understand, and we mentioned it in the prepared remarks, those headwinds that we have experienced in half two will still be with us in half one of this fiscal year.\nSo we expect this year not to be linear and we have to accelerate sales growth throughout the quarters as some of these headwinds annualize and we return to growth. But overall, I think we're well set up to deliver against the guidance metrics we just communicated.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nI agree with everything that Andre just said. I would remind you, relative to the comment of performing versus our own expectations. Precisely because of the volatility of the world that we all live and operate in, we don't provide quarterly guidance. We only provide annual guidance. And as Andre said, we met or beat each of those numbers that were provided. There have been two kind of primary questions that we've all been working through. One is can we reaccelerate volume? And as Andre said, that is broadly happening and impressively so.\nSo if we look at North America over the course of the fiscal year +3, +3, +4, +3, if we look at Europe +2, +3, +4, +2, Andre gave you figures for some of the other regions. But broadly, that question of can volume be re-accelerated is answered with an emphatic yes. The second question that at least we've been working through is can that happen in the context of continued margin expansion? If you look at the fiscal year numbers, top line to bottom line, that's definitely happened. If you look at gross margin in the quarter we just completed, which comes in at a 17-year high.\nWe're certainly able to continue to reaccelerate volume growth while holding our building margins. So, like Andre, I approached next year in a realistic fashion and realizing that the first couple quarters are going to look a little bit more like the one that we just completed, but with overall a belief that the fundamentals of the business are in very strong shape and that as we bring the innovation that's planned to market throughout the fiscal year, we're going to be happy with the results in line with the guidance that he's provided.\nOne other element of the strength and health of the business, fundamentally, if you look at the last fiscal year at a brand level, 21 out of 25 brands were growing. 11 of those 25 brands were growing at high single digit or higher rates. So again, from a breadth standpoint, I think we're positioned very well and the team's doing a great job.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Actually, just wanted to follow up on those last two points you made, John, on the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for fiscal 25. Can you just parse out a bit more detail in terms of how you're thinking about the balance between pricing and volume? I know you won't want to be exact, but how you're thinking about that and the 3% to 4% category growth assumption? Do you think there's good visibility there given the slow in pricing?\nAnd then, if you bless me with the part B, just how do you think about earnings flex relative to top line given some of the top line volatility? Obviously significant year-over-year gross margin expansion in fiscal 2024, but that's been dissipating. You boosted marketing a lot. You've got strong productivity as you mentioned, there's a lot going on, sort of, in the margin line items. So, just how do you think about earnings flex next year relative to top line growth, given some of this volatility? Thanks.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Dara. I'm going to turn it over to Andre to take us through some of the details, and then I'll round out the answer. But go ahead, Andre.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Dara. The volume versus price mix contribution is expected to be broadly balanced. We expected markets to return to more sustainable growth rates of 3% to 4%. That is largely happening now. And if you look at the construction of that market growth, about half of that is driven by volume. The other half is driven by price mix. I would expect our construct to look similar for the fiscal year. Obviously it will differ by quarter and half, front half versus back half, but broadly balanced between volume and price mix.\nOn the margin perspective, you saw us make a choice to continue to invest fully in the business. We have delivered very strong productivity, more than $2 billion in productivity for the year, and we have significantly increased our media support, and we see the results for those investments in the strong growth we continue to deliver in North America, including share growth consistently across every period. The strong results in Europe Focus Markets, including strong volume growth consistent across the quarters. So if you're good about those investments, we'll continue to be very disciplined, and, as you can appreciate, not all of those investments will have paid out.\nSo as we do our post-event analysis, we reassess every step of the way, whether those are better flow to the P&L or reinvested somewhere else. Productivity for fiscal 2025 is also very strong as I mentioned in my previous comments. So that will allow us to maintain fully invested both in terms of market support as well as innovation, which is really the underpinning driver for our growth next year.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nI would just add two or three comments. One, as Andre indicated, where you see the increase in marketing investment, that is largely in the geographies where we're seeing the growth, accompany that from a top line standpoint. As he also said, we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of that spending, and we'll adjust either up or down accordingly. Also, I just want to make sure we all understand that the return on those investments is not an overnight occurrence.\nWe have a commercialization cycle that needs to run its course. We have consumer purchase cycles that can be annual in some cases, while our portfolio is constructed to focus on categories where the product is used daily. That doesn't mean it's purchased daily. And so it sometimes takes a little bit of time to evaluate and see the market response to those investments.\nBut if you look at the last several years, it's generally always been there, and it's been one of the reasons for the growth over the last, call it, six years, as I mentioned in my remarks: +5, +6, +6, +7, +7, +4 in a more challenging environment. So like Andre, I feel good about the balance that's implied in the guidance and in our internal plans, but it's something we wake up every day and continue to reevaluate and deliver in an optimal way.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nStever Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning guys, thank you. I was hoping that we could talk about fabric, home, baby, and families specifically. It seems like those are the two segments that drove the most disconnect, at least versus external forecast. The release cites promotional spending and at least a degree of share loss across those segments.\nSo maybe you could just drill down further into the headline numbers, give us a bit more context in what you're seeing both competitively and within your own momentum, and just how we should think about both the drivers and the timing of the build back in those businesses. Noting you've obviously got some challenging first half comparisons, especially in the current quarter, but just you're really understanding where you expect those businesses to trend and land over the course of fiscal 25.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Steve. Look, home care, I think it's just performing outstandingly well. 9% organic sales growth on the year, 13 quarters of sustained share growth, and gaining momentum. So I think I focus my comments on fabric here, and I would tell you two things. Number one, we are annualizing record periods in Europe with differentiated pricing between competitors, where we had a bit of a tailwind last year that is turning into a high base comp. But structurally the business is in great shape. In Europe, Ariel continues to perform extremely well. The innovation across unit dose and the broader portfolio including FE is doing very well.\nSo I expect that business to reaccelerate very quickly. In North America we are just launching the Innovation Bundle, the spring Innovation Bundle which is supported with the right level of investment, including promotion investment and merchandising investment. And that's why you see the negative price mix component in the North American business. But the business is picking up momentum, we're growing share. So I expect also North America to continue to move in the right direction on Fabricare, and we're very encouraged with the innovation, both the innovation that just launched and the innovation that is in the pipeline.\nLast point, maybe on Fabric Care in China specifically, we also made a portfolio choice to focus on the most profitable part of the business. And so there are some short-term implications in terms of base period there again for the longer-term benefit of the China Fabric Care business. I think that's the right decision, but it's part of the softness that you see right now in the current quarter. Baby Care, I'll talk two regions. One is North America. The Baby Care business on the premium end continues to be doing very well. We have Swaddlers growing share by 1.4%. Cruisers 360 is growing.\nSo on the premium end of the spectrum where we've been able to innovate over the past one to two years, we continue to see the momentum accelerating. Across Pampers, we have an opportunity. We had an opportunity on Luvs, the mid-tier brand, where we postponed innovation due to some supply chain challenges. That innovation is now in the market. So again, very, very significant acceleration expected given the innovation just launched in the market over the next few quarters.\nIn Europe, again, base period, mostly. In terms of share data, and that is something we'll need to work through, and certainly in Europe, baby, I think that's one of the areas where we're watching our sufficiency of innovation very closely, simply because the spread versus private label is the most significant. So again, the team is working through strong communication and innovation that will be launching here over the next few quarters.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'm just going to go in a slightly different direction here, Steve. Fully agree with Andre's description. There are also categories and sectors that are making really strong progress, that as we annualize the few challenges within them should manifest itself more clearly than it is now, so we'll have the benefit of those, as we go through the year. What am I talking about? If you look at beauty as an example, the aggregate results are being heavily impacted by two things, SK-II and China, both of which should annualize by the second half of the year. If you then step back and look at the balance of the business, Head & Shoulders, in part behind the Bayer innovation.\nIncreased sales by 7% last year. Pantene, in part behind the Pantene Miracles innovation, grew 10% last year. The personal care side of the business is growing extremely well as well. So I just want to kind of complete the picture in terms of some of the progress that isn't as obvious in the aggregate look, but will make a difference going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Dircetor, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. I was wondering if you could comment a bit because one thing that's been absent is a discussion of the consumer broadly. So I think it could be helpful to get some perspective on the consumer environment. It feels like in US and Western Europe from what we've heard from other companies, that things in the last month or two have kind of gotten demonstrably worse. As a general statement. So, curious your perspective on that and then also differences in channel performance and what you're doing around that in terms of areas of particular focus or investment. Thanks.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nSo, from a consumer standpoint, we generally don't see the dynamic that some are describing, and I'm not meaning to discredit their descriptions, but if you look at a couple of dynamics. Private label shares as an example, which typically would be increasing during a time of significant consumer pressure, that's not what we're seeing. Private label shares generally, both in North America and Europe, are in line with pre-COVID levels and period-to-period. So last quarter to this quarter are not changing significantly. The second data point that we look at to assess the answer to your question is back to volume. Is unit growth declining? And that's again not what we're generally seeing.\nNow certainly there are some consumers that are, I'm sure, under increased pressure and are probably modifying their behaviors and purchases correspondingly. But in our categories, and remember, of course. These are less discretionary categories. These are daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We typically have the best performing product in the market, at least that's our objective, and as a result we're not seeing any significant consumer driven impact.\nI've been in Europe quite a bit recently. I'll be back there tomorrow. Andre was there earlier in the month of June with many of you at the Deutsche Bank conference, but also spend time with our business. And I'm not seeing it there either. So we remain encouraged as we go forward. It's something that we're very cognizant of and watch very closely. But so far so good.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThe market growth rates I think substantiate the point that John made. If you look at the US, I think the key point is over the past one, three, six, 12 months, the category volume growth in our categories is consistently 2%. So consumers are not decelerating consumption across all categories. And similarly, if you look at value growth in Europe, it's also very consistent over the same periods. So as John said, we're watching it but we don't see it in the data.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nAnd even, you know, if we look at the responsiveness to many of our strong innovations I mentioned in my remarks, Oral-B, that's growing, which is a significant premium to the balance of the market, both within the power segment and across power and manual, and it's growing at double digits. We built two share points in the last year. So just an example of responsiveness to strong innovation in these categories where performance drives brand choice.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, EvercoreISI\n\nGreat, thank you very much. A couple of follow up. Could you just talk a little bit about the Enterprise Markets, what they would have looked like ex Argentina, and then as you look at your guidance, how much of an actual rebound in China are you assuming? How much, if any, rebound in the Middle East issues, are you assuming, and is that part of the range, or is there no rebound at all in the range? If that's clear. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nLook, hey Robert, Enterprise Markets I think in aggregate are performing strongly for the year, up 6%. Last year they were up, I think 10%. So I think very strong continued growth. Latin America, as we said, is growing on the year 15% and in the most recent quarter 8%. Europe Focus Markets up 8% for the year. Where we see headwinds is in the Middle East in line with what we have described. So you see our Asia, Middle East, and Africa markets impacted by those Middle East headwinds, and again we expect those to be temporary. The Argentina contribution to the total number is decreasing by almost a point quarter-over-quarter. So it was only 30 basis points in the current quarter.\nMost importantly, we divested the Argentina business so that effect will not matter anymore in the current year because it will be removed from the organic sales base as we move through the quarter here. In terms of assumptions, I think that's part of the range, right? I would say we largely assume annualization. The upper end of the range would assume some level of improvement. But I think the main contribution to the midpoint of the range would be a normalization and annualization of those headwinds we were describing, including China, SK-II, the Middle East, and again Argentina coming out of the base because of the divestiture of the business.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nRobert, my view of those things, as it's reflected in guidance generally or indirectly, is just as Andre described, which is annualization. I think if things improve either in the Middle East or China, we should have the opportunity to deliver ceteris paribus even better results than the midpoint of the guidance range. On the other hand, we're not assuming, I'm not assuming that they get worse and that can always happen. So I think we're centered on a realistic expectation of outcomes.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. I was hoping if you can talk about a bit of the price and mixes you're seeing in the category. I do understand what John just described as being a very low penetration of private label, and consumers are still driving the preference for your brand. But just curious about in laundry specifically you had some promo, and some of the things that you discussed are not necessarily driven by price sensitivity, but just wondering how you're seeing as we see more pricing coming through and if you're planning embedded in any of these guidance.\nI understand it's a balanced approach to the organic sales growth at the midpoint at 4%, but wondering if there is any ways of like mitigating some of the effects in some of these other places which is natural and therefore we can see some pricing go through inflation-led and some pricing also led by innovation. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Andrea. Yeah. I mean pricing and mix have been a positive contribution to our results for 19 years. I don't expect this year to be different. I think it will be pricing for foreign exchange headwinds in some of the enterprise markets. Which is in line with what the market generally executes. I also expect innovation based pricing and trade up as we have a strong innovation pipeline in the year.\nFrom a promotion environment, we see stability at the moment. We have pockets of incremental promotion. We're still operating at about 85% versus pre-COVID levels, and we see general stability. So, as I said in the guidance deconstruction on the top line, roughly we see the market half price mix driven, half volume driven. I don't expect our fiscal year numbers to be different than that, but they will look different, obviously, half one versus half two because of base period. But the general model is still the same as we executed over the last 19 years.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector or Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the commodity outlook. Andre, you mentioned $300 million in headwind expected in fiscal 2025. Can you maybe talk about the components of the headwind? Some of the key commodities, including pulp, resins, and also on the transportation side, given the recent rise in ocean freight. Any potential impact there? Any. And then, in terms of, I know some of the commodities you cannot hedge, but just the level of visibility given your contract rates on the headwind. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Hey Filippo. The commodity portfolio is actually at the moment relatively stable. Most of that headwind that is in the guidance is pulp at the moment. We continue to see strong demand on some of the grades and limited supply. So that's driving the run up. The rest of the portfolio is actually stable. It won't be that throughout the year, as you know. I mean these things change quickly. So there's a level of variability here obviously, and we're forecasting at spot rate as we always do.\nThe commodity effects, as we think through visibility. Look, I mean the flow through is definitely different by commodity class. But I think we discussed this when we were in the middle of the commodity crisis. It generally takes three months to nine months to flow through the P&L. So I think at the end of Q1 we probably have relatively good visibility on most of it through half one. And then we'll go step by step. But again this is one that we forecast on spot. We don't hedge.\nSo the flow through again is the key driver of latency in terms of P&L, in terms of P&L effect. Transportation, look, generally energy, oil is relatively stable. So overall tempered transportation is flat. Yes, we see some impact from increased transportation on the sea routes, but it is not material in the context of the year at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. I wanted to go back to Lauren's question on the consumer and totally recognize that you may not be seeing some of the indicators that the consumer is under pressure today. But when we think about the 3% to 4% category growth assumptions you're embedding for your outlook, is there any cushion for the 85% of the that are currently performing well could potentially slow it all. You know, totally get the annualization commentary in the Middle East in China, but just would love to get some perspective on what you expect maybe in North America and Western Europe from here. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey. Peter. Yeah. The 3% to 4% is a global number. Look, deconstructing that by market or by region is increasingly difficult, and we somewhat rely on the total aggregate of regions to play out in the 3% to 4% range. To your question on the 85% of the business slowing.\nWhat we see is actually what we had expected, right, that those regions slow down from a market growth in the range of 5% to 8% to this 3% to 4% range because the price mix component is coming down and the volume component is coming up. And that stabilization is built into our assumption for the year. So we expect most of those regions to play out the same way that we're projecting the global number, which is 3% to 4%, half of it volume, half of it price mix.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. I had a question on your beauty segment. You know, China has been a drag to your volumes for a while as you mentioned, and we've been hearing about the ongoing challenges in the region. More recently we're also hearing about the slowdown in the US beauty market. Curious if that's consistent with what you're seeing. Then how should we think about the growth outlook for your beauty segment this fiscal year and if it's fair to assume that these challenges could drive a further slowdown from here. Thanks.",
    "content2": "Andre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Bonnie. If you look at the beauty results outside of China and SK-II, I think they give a better indication of the growth potential and trajectory. The business ex SK-II is growing 6% in Q4, 7% in the fiscal year that we just closed. When you go through the segments and the core brands, if you look at Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, for example, grew high single digits to double digits. Those were the best results in the past five years.\nWhen you look at our personal care business, Old Spice, Secret, and Native double digit growth we talked about, John talked about Native now being and reaching $700 million in sales, 10x what we got the brand with. Our new brands, Mielle and OUAI, are also growing double digits. So I think we see strength across the portfolio there. North America hair care is up 12%, global hair care is up 9%. The personal care business, as I said, is doing very well. I think the core of the core of the piece we are annualizing is really China, both on the Olay business and on the SK-II business.\nAs we said, our expectation is that we'll annualize. We don't yet assume a material acceleration in the fiscal year. I'll leave it there. Again, I think the core of the business is strong. China is the one piece we'll need to see annualize across the first half.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nObviously we play in the majority of the spaces that we play in. Beauty are more foundational versus prestige. I think where some of the commentary in the marketplace is being directed relative to slowdown is really not in the base segments that we play in, and as Andre said, have continued to see very, very strong growth. That's why I wanted to add to the question earlier because I think it's somewhat lost in the aggregate numbers. But I think it's important both for recognition of the team, but also recognition of the potential.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Carey\n\nHead of Consumer Staples Research, Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning. I know we're later in the call, so apologies for another China question, but maybe a bit more focused. It has been sluggish for a few years, which I think is why there's been so many questions about the effect of annualizing. You're not the only company to see slower results in China, so I wonder if you could just maybe comment on? Clearly there are macro dynamics in the market versus micro parts of your portfolio which specifically need some work as Q2 has been well covered by this point.\nSo, perhaps you can speak to some other businesses that are performing in line with your expectations or not so that we can have a bit more of a portfolio view on why the annualization should deliver the outcomes you're expecting into the back half of the year. So sorry for another question on China, but it felt important. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Chris, I'll start and John will add. Let me start by saying, I think the China business coming from a double-digit growth trajectory. Through a significant dip, and we don't expect it to go back to double digits. We expect it over time to go to maybe mid singles. So more in line with what we see in other developed markets. So for sure we don't expect the return to the growth rates that we saw pre-COVID. Many of the effects specifically in China. SK-II, I think the run rate is now stable. So we're already seeing the run rate in terms of absolute volume and absolute dollar sales flattening.\nWhat's not yet there is the base period in line with those run rates. So unless we see a significant run rate reduction, that gives us confidence that the annualization would take place. Maybe other points of confidence here. The toughest category to compete in in China right now is probably baby care. Birth rates are down 15% to 25%, depending on how you define the market. And we've been able, the team has been able to grow sales 6% and grow share in the market. Why? Because the portfolio and the innovation the team designed was very specific to the Chinese consumer, their needs, their preference in terms of superiority, and that's driving results.\nWe've been able to grow the Braun business with strong innovation. So there are pockets of business where we are leading the market. We need to find our way to that across more categories, which we're working on. Fabric Care, as I said, is very focused on the profitable part of the portfolio, which allows them to drive innovation, which allows them to drive category growth. That's really what's playing out across categories. But I think the most mechanical driver is run rates are stable and stabilizing. Therefore, unless we see a further decline in the market, which is entirely possible. But if those run rates hold, that will drive annualization towards the back half of the year.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nAnd just to round that out the largest business for P&G in China is hair care and we've spent the last year plus as we came out of COVID ensuring that we had very strong hair care plans. I am very pleased with the plans that we've put together and the execution of them. On Pantene, the same on Head & Shoulders, really significantly improved propositions, significantly improved packaging, really looking strong. Andre mentioned somewhere in our discussion that we had made the choice to exit the third brand, which was Vidal Sassoon. So that should not be a source of drag going forward. We're still working to be candid on the plans for Rejoice, but the net of all of that is pretty encouraging.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question for both of you. Perhaps just on some context for investment levels, specifically trade, spending, and advertising, which are clearly moving higher. Gross margin and expansion there has naturally been supportive. I know it's not lost on you guys. You've seen what your key competitor in oral care is doing. Advertising and marketing, there was the highest as a percent of sales in at least a couple decades. We've seen trade spending move higher there in their North America segment. Advertising and marketing now for Procter & Gamble moved up 200 basis points this year, including a big step up at 300 basis points in the quarter.\nAnd we talked earlier in the call about fabricators. That's all kind of a big thing. If you could offer some context here for higher investment levels broadly we're seeing in the industry, and then perhaps a push from a Procter perspective: are we satisfied with the top line payback that we're seeing because spending levels are moving higher, and the push would be organic sales, understanding some of the idiosyncratic items in the quarter was a little bit soft, and we're kind of guiding for growth similar to what we've seen historically. So thank you for all that. I'd appreciate your context and color. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Let me start, Kevin. Morning. Generally what I tell you is we're happy with the payout that we're seeing in the markets where we can read the payout cleanly. That's really where 95% of the investment is, meaning Europe focused markets, some of the Europe enterprise markets, Latin America, and North America. I think the top line results support the overall payout of the aggregate of the media spend. We obviously go way lower in terms of penetration, and it is probably the strongest push that both John and I and Shailesh have as we engage with the businesses to ensure that that spending truly is productive, truly is driving market growth and sales growth.\nTherefore helps us to deliver top line and bottom line for the quarter and for the fiscal year. If that's no longer the case, then we will change gears and adjust. In terms of overall spending, I'm actually pleased to see increase in media spend and market support. That's market constructive. I think it helps the consumer understand the category better. It helps drive penetration, which is still a huge opportunity across multiple categories. That's very positive. Again, the promotion environment in aggregate remains productive. As long as those two result in what we see in North America, which is sustained volume growth on the category and sustained value growth on the category, I think we're in a good place.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nYou know, it's something I've been pushing, we've been pushing for some period of time when you have a strategy that's centered on innovation and superiority and you have, in some cases, relatively low levels of advertising reach. That total equation doesn't make sense. We used to call it. David Taylor used to call it confidential superiority. So we do. We're trying to in an effective way and in the most efficient way we can, and I mentioned this earlier. Increase reach so that more consumers are aware of our products and the benefits that they provide them.\nObviously that effort at some point reaches the right level of maturity. But we're still on the incline curve in that regard right now, which I think is entirely the right thing to do. As I mentioned earlier, it takes some time temporally for the business to respond. It does not respond overnight again because of purchase cycles and commercialization cycles themselves. But as Andre said, and you know, take some assurance that you've got a former CFO and the CEO's chair between the two of us, we're not interested in and wasting your money.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst Consumer, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow up on promotion. If you could just talk about how much is competitors catching up on innovation driving you to spend more, to stay superior versus response the tougher macros and needing to make yourself more competitive on price. And then more importantly, you know, you've obviously done substantial innovation at the premium end. What are you doing as we think about this evolving macro in your mid tier products remind consumers and value proposition there. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey Olivia. I think our job is to lead market growth via irresistible superiority, and that starts with product, package, and communication, but it includes value, as you point out. I don't see that equation shifting. The competitive environment in terms of promotion is relatively stable. Our approach to promotion is relatively stable across the regions where we have the highest visibility, which is Europe and North America. So I don't view that that equation as being different.\nAnd again I think our stance on superiority, which we talked about now for almost a year to reset the level of superiority we expect our businesses to deliver, which moves from your job is no longer to just win against the next best competitor in the market, but is to create superiority at a level where consumers are drawn into the category. So we create new consumption, we create new consumers coming into the category, increasing their usage or trading up. That's really what we are measuring ourselves against, and I think we're making very good progress, and I'm very confident in the innovation pipeline we see for the current year.\nI'm sure Jon has to add more on the mid tier absolutely, our job is to be irresistibly superior at every tier we compete in. That's why, you know, the Luvs innovation is a great example, and it's a great example for the strategy at work, because if we're not superior in the mid tier, the consumer tells us and it shows in the results. The counteraction to innovate and drive superiority is what we do and it's really independent of the tier. At any given point in time, we need to make sure that we deliver all five vectors at every tier, every pack size, every price point, in every channel we competed.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nIf you just assume for a minute, Olivia, that we're wrong in the ongoing discussion that we've had about consumers being under pressure. Our contention is that that really hasn't manifested itself as of yet. But just assume that we're wrong or that that changes going forward. And to your question on innovation, it becomes very important that we're innovating in categories. That are going to become that are going to see even higher levels of demand if in fact there's any kind of consumer downturn. Andre mentioned Luvs another example. I mean, what happens if there's a consumer downturn?\nPeople eat at home more often, they're going out less frequently, traveling less frequently. And so categories like hand dishwashing, for example, become important. And our levels of innovation in that category, just as an example, are significant between you know, Powerwash on Dawn and EZ-Squeeze. Andre mentioned the growth rates that we're seeing in our Dish business. Typically this was certainly the case in COVID, which was an extreme condition. But people use more paper products if they're staying home more often.\nSo things like the Charmin Easy Tear scallop perforation, which is driving significant levels of delight and 5% growth on the Charmin business last year, is another example of innovating. Continuing to innovate in categories that are going to potentially be even more relevant in the event of a consumer downturn. And obviously just in general, that hand wash business is more of, if you will, mid-tier business than the auto dish business. So there's no discrimination in terms of our commitment to innovation.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning everybody. Wanted to ask about SK-II more broadly and just how do you see it as part of today's portfolio for P&G? I get the slower improvement in China than anticipated. Just curious, if you take a look over the last, call it four or five years, it does seem like the brand has grown in totality a little bit below what I'd peg is the peer group. I guess I'm curious why you think that is.\nHow you weave in improving trends in China with the overall expectations for the brand on a go forward basis. And I say all that too in the context of weakness predating the wastewater release in Japan. And so what is there, is there more competition? Are you doing more from an innovation standpoint to broaden the appeal for the brand? Can you move it beyond prestige skin care? Just broader strokes again in the context of how does it fit within the portfolio? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGo ahead. Yeah. Hey, Mark, I think your question specifically on China. I would say I don't think our brand portfolio is something that I would be unhappy with. I think the brand portfolio is strong when we get it right and when the consumer is willing to engage. I think we show strong progress on baby care even in adverse market conditions. Jon mentioned the progress we see on hair care, on Head & Shoulders, and on Pantene. I think the parts of the portfolio where we had our doubts. We made the right choices. So we divested without the soon.\nWe believe that was the right change in hair care. We have trimmed the fabric care portfolio to ensure that we can focus on the part of the market where we can create value for the consumer and for the company. So I feel good about the product portfolio. The challenge, I think in China, if I may, part of that is the channel shift because our footprint was disproportionately developed over 30 years to be a brick and mortar footprint. And the digital acceleration obviously with COVID has shifted that into online to a large degree fa ster than anywhere else in the world.\nAnd within that online business, particularly to Douyin, heavily KOL-led and heavily promotion-led. And we're taking our time to transition our portfolio to ensure we end up with the right balance between serving consumers and brick and mortar and creating value there and supporting our brands with the right messaging, equity, price stability, and innovation in the online channels. So that for me that is the transition we're still in but I think that transition is going well, and it will show that that portfolio that we operate, I think, can sustain mid single growth and value creation in China.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nEverybody. Good morning. I know as we get deep into the call, it gets quite granular, but if we could bring it back. A little bit on something I think might have been missed as we chat global versus domestic, which is maybe just thinking about North America specifically in the first half, specifically what is the direction of travel that you're assuming for the consumer? When we think about annualization of pricing and such, should we be modeling a drag for North America in the first half that then reverses? Or is it meant to be closer to that balance for the full year of 50/50?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nKaumil, it's very hard to predict, obviously, by quarter or half one versus half two. I think your incoming hunch is what I would share as I think the price mix neutralization will continue through half one. The volume component I think is relatively stable. As I said, the market is continuing to grow at 2%. Price mix has come down to about 0.5%, and I think that's what I would expect from a market growth perspective for the front half.\nOur objective is, as always, to be within that range. So that's my view. But again that volatility can be driven by different innovation cycles. It can be driven by different promotion cycles, by channel shifts. So there's a lot of variability within that. But purely extrapolating from what we see in the market today, I think your hunch is right.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Robert Moskow of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thanks for the question. I guess the only thing not covered on this call is the Olympics. I think I've seen about 100 ads for Procter & Gamble products, some of them great. I haven't noticed an increase in merchandising activity in our Nielsen tracking data in the US around it. I was just wondering, do you view the Olympic sponsorship more as a brand building exercise for consumers or have you been getting and do you expect to get a lot of merchandising activity around it in the US that we'll be able to see in our tracking? Thanks.\n\nJohn Chevalier\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe definitely view support of the Olympics as a brand building opportunity, as a consumer outreach opportunity, and frankly as a customer outreach opportunity. Where you'll see the activation in store is typically closer to the region of the event, so I wouldn't expect it to have large activation in North America. I'm headed to Paris overnight tonight. I do expect to see significant activation in Europe. I'll be meeting with many of our retail partner CEOs at the Games. We host them there and spend up to a couple days together building plans going forward, which would include both during event and post-event activation of the assets that we've put in place for the Olympics.\nJust like our earlier discussion on return, this is something that we look at annually. But thus far it's proving to be an attractive vehicle when we focus the messaging on brands, and not so much when we focus the messaging on company. Simply because nobody buys P&G, they buy Tide and Ariel, and Pampers and Pantene, and Head & Shoulders, et cetera. So all good. And I'm looking forward to being there with our customers and our European team over the balance of the week.\nHey, before we officially end the call. I just wanted to provide again some longer term perspective. I'm happy to discuss it at any point during the balance of the day. We have been through the collective. We, including you, have been through incredible challenges the last number of years. Whether that's Covid, whether that's inflation. Whether that's war, political divisiveness, regulation, you name it, and one of the things that I think is important to reflect on the quarter is important, and we reflected a lot on that today, which is appropriate. But it's also important to step back and say, you know, how is this strategy working not just for the quarter, but for longer periods of time.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks pre-COVID. During COVID, post-COVID inflation and pricing, and then the big geopolitical struggles that we're all engaged in currently. Over that six-year period, the team has added $17 billion in sales, which puts us at the 88th percentile of the S&P 500. And at the same time they've added $5 billion in profit, which puts us at the 93rd percentile of the S&P 500. They've built more than 200. I haven't looked today, but before today, $200 billion in market cap in that six-year period, which is more value than most of our competitors. I think all but one have created over their entire history as a company.\nSo this is something that is working extraordinarily well, and I think that's important to reflect on as we move forward. We're in a stronger place in terms of executing against that strategy than we've ever been. We've talked about investment and innovation. We've talked about raising the bar on superiority. We've talked about the progress that we're making on productivity. We've talked about the support levels that our business has. We've talked about resuming volume growth in most of the major markets and doing that while building margin and simultaneously increasing our investment in these kinds of things.\nI don't see any reason in a if we do find ourselves in a more difficult environment from a consumer economic standpoint, one of the things we talk about internally is would we change our approach, if we either had confidence that things were going to get remarkably better from a consumer standpoint? Or remarkably worse from a consumer standpoint. Would we not want to be in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice? I think that's exactly where we want to be in either of those scenarios. Would we not want to be able to delight consumers and customers with superior products? I can't imagine how that would be a good idea.\nWould we not want to have the productivity that enables us to fund those investments and accelerate innovation? Would we not want to have a more agile, accountable organizational structure? So all these things to me under any scenario, both because of the results that they've delivered and because of the potential they hold to delight consumers, customers, employees, society, and share owners are the right path forward. Which is why we talk about continuing to double down. I've said many times this will not be a straight line. There are all sorts of things that affect the trend line in the business, but over periods of time, this is by far if we just look at our history as a company.\nIt has produced significantly positive results and I expect that to continue. So I just wanted to share that as we close out the call. Again, that is not trying to minimize some of the challenges that we've been discussing on the quarter and in the first half of next year. Those are real, they're important to talk about, but I don't think they're controlling as we think about the mid and longer term. Have a great day and look forward to catching up with you soon.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures.\nProcter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its investor relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market share results and another quarter of strong earnings and cash results. The strong results we've delivered in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners. Specifically on the numbers, organic sales grew 3%. Volume was in line with prior year, showing sequential progress.\nPricing contributed three points to sales growth as we continue to annualize price increases taken last fiscal year.\nMix was neutral to organic sales growth, and growth across categories continues to be broad-based, with 8 of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales in this quarter. Grooming organic sales grew double digits. Home care and hair care up high singles. Oral care grew mid-single digits. Fabric care, family care, feminine care, and personal health care were up low singles. Skin and personal care and baby care organic sales were lower versus prior year. Growth was also broad-based across geographies. North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific focus markets, and Latin America and Europe enterprise markets are each growing organic sales.\nGlobal aggregate value share was up versus prior year, with 29 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Focus markets grew organic sales 2% for the quarter, and enterprise markets grew 4%. Organic sales in North America grew 3%, with three points of volume growth.\nOver the last four quarters, volume growth in North America has been +2%, +3%, +4%, and now +3%. These results include over a point of impact from retail inventory reductions, primarily in personal health care. Consumer demand for P&G brands remains very strong in the US, with our outlet consumption value growth of 5%. Our outlet value share was up 10 basis points versus prior year. US volume share was up 40 basis points, reflecting continued strong volume growth ahead of the underlying market. The gap between consumer offtake of 5% compared to our US sales growth of 3% reflects the aforementioned trade inventory reductions in the quarter.\nEurope focus markets were up 7%, with four points of volume growth. Value share in Europe focus markets was up 100 basis points over the past three months. Latin America organic sales were up 17%.\nArgentina is a significant contributor to this result, given the pricing taken to offset the more than 400% devaluation of the Argentine peso since the start of the year. Mexico and Brazil are annualizing high base periods with organic sales growth in the 20s and 30s, and we expect will normalize back to pre-COVID levels in the mid to high single digits. As we noted last quarter, there are some specific issues affecting other markets. Those challenges continue to impact results in the quarter. Greater China organic sales were down 10% versus prior year. Progress versus the December quarter, but still impacted by weak underlying market conditions and headwinds for SK-II and other\nJapanese brands in the market. SK-II sales in Greater China were down around 30% for the quarter.\nWe have seen some month-to-month improvement in overall Greater China sales trends, though we expect it will be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some of the European enterprise and Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, and Malaysia have remained soft since the start of the heightened tensions in the Middle East. Also, shipments in Russia continue to decline, double digits given our reduced footprint and curtailed investments with consumers and retailers. Combined, the headwinds from Greater China and Asia-Middle East Africa markets were a 150 basis points impact on total\ncompany sales for the quarter. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.52, up 11% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, Core EPS increased 18%.\nCore gross margin increased 310 basis points, and operating margin increased 90 basis points. Strong productivity improvement of 320 basis points enabled continued strong investment in superior products, packaging, and consumer communication to drive market growth. Currency-neutral Core operating margin increased 220 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 87%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. Over three quarters, more than $10 billion returned to share owners in dividends and repurchases.\nLast week, we announced a 7% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners. This is the 68th consecutive annual dividend increase, and the 134th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend.\nIn summary, again, we'll continue to be a challenging and volatile operating environment. Strong overall results enabling us to increase our earnings projections for the year and to maintain our guidance ranges for organic sales and cash generation, all while sustaining strong investment in superiority to both category consumption and to restore business growth in China and in the Middle East. Our teams continue to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past five years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation.\nA portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value for each price tier where we compete.\nWe are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of our operations to fund investment in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins, and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technology that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is empowered, agile, and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with four focus areas: strong progress on supply chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability,\nand a superior employee value equation. These four focus areas are not new or separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization reinforce and build on each other.\nWhen executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales, and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. Moving on to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer, and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong results year to date enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year.\nWe're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5 for the fiscal year. We're squarely in the middle of this range, fiscal year to date.\nThis outlook assumes continued normalization in underlying market growth rates that we've seen over the past few quarters. Markets will be lapping the last waves of cost recovery pricing, and volumes slowly begin to recover. We also expect the market-level changes we faced through Q3 to continue in Q4, though with some directional improvement. On the bottom line, enabled by 15% Core EPS growth year to date, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2024, core earnings per share from a range of 8% to 9 to a range of 10% to 11. This outlook includes continued strong investments in innovation and brand building to grow markets and extend the superiority of P&G offerings to\nconsumers. We now estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $900 million after tax in fiscal 2024, based on current spot prices.\nThis is a modest improvement versus the outlook we provided last quarter, though nearly all of this benefit has been booked in the first three quarters of the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $600 million after tax for the fiscal year. The change versus prior guidance reflects volatility in Argentina exchange rates, including a period of currency appreciation in Q3 and a revised devaluation outlook for Q4. We also reflect a reduction in Argentina FX exposure due to the divestiture of our Argentina fabric and home care business, which we completed in mid-March, and reduced assumptions for future volume and pricing given the current rate outlook and\nrecent shipment trends. The net impact of these changes is a relatively modest help to the bottom line, which is reflected in our updated EPS outlook.\nWe expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%, and we expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 to $6 billion in common stock. Combine the plan to return $14 to $15 billion of cash to share owners for the year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, or major production stoppages\nare not anticipated within these guidance ranges.\nFinally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping a close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain a superior value for consumers and for retailers. The entire P&G organization remains focused on excellent execution of our integrated market constructive strategy, which has delivered strong results in a challenging operating and competitive environment. While we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we are confident the best path forward is to double down on this strategy, remain fully invested to drive irresistible superiority across\nevery part of our portfolio, and stay focused on delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for our share owners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you have a question, please press star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, please press star followed by two. Your first question today comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Andre, I wanted to talk a little bit about market growth versus market share. So first off, if you could just, I know you said volatile a few times, but just if you could give us a sense for sort of a high-level expectation for global market growth over the next 12 months. And then digging in a little bit more specifically, you offered comments on share performance, particularly in North America and also in Europe focus. But I was curious if you could talk maybe about market share trends or the degree you can tell in China. And maybe let's talk about it excluding SK-II because I think that's an issue unto itself, but just a sense of P&G's performance versus the China\nmarket overall. Since it's been lagging for quite a while, arguably, things that you guys are seeing, addressing, doing differently, or considering doing differently to shift that trend? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nVery good morning, Lauren. So let me start with overall consumption strength because it really is and continues to be strong. The consumption trends in the markets are stable despite multiple headwinds, and P&G is growing consumer offtake in terms of value share in 29 of our top 50 category country combinations. Globally, we are growing value share by 10 basis points, and the consumption trends are really strong across markets, with few exceptions, which we'll get into. US consumption in Q3 was 5%, and P&G value share is up. So our consumption actually grew ahead of that, both in terms of value and in terms of volume, actually with volume share being up 40\nbasis points on all outlets in the most recent period. So continued strength in consumption trends in North America and continued strength in terms of P&G performance within that consumption.\nEurope-focused markets' consumption is in the range of 8% to 9, also very strong, and we are growing by more than a share point within that market. Both volume growth is very strong with four points in the quarter and three points of price mix. LA and Europe enterprise markets are growing, and so the business from a consumption standpoint, which really for us is the most important metric, is in a good place. We continue to deal with very specific headwinds in Q3 that we've discussed already in Q2, but they continue. There's a soft market consumption in China. We'll get more into that to the second part of your question.\nSK-II continues to be a headwind in the quarter, and we see some impact from tensions in the Middle East.\nWhen you sum it all up, that's about a point and a half impact on the global top line. And then we have the inventory reduction in North America, which is about a point on the global top line as well. And if you put it together, two conclusions. One, the headwinds that we're calling out are temporary in nature. So first of all, the inventory reduction, which is a point on the top line, we expect that to be a single event, not a continued phenomena to observe. It was mainly driven by personal healthcare because the supply situation is stabilizing after a softer season, so retailers don't need to hold safety stock. And the headwinds in China on SK-II and in the Middle East will ease\nover time and eventually annualize over the coming quarters. That does not mean that we will ignore any of the headwinds.\nWe are fully focused on accelerating growth in China on SK-II and driving sustainable growth in Asia, and Middle East markets, but it explains that we can hold our organic sales growth guidance at 4% to 5. We're very confident in that, and fiscal year to date, as we mentioned in the script, we're right at that level. Last point on that topic, we remain fully invested, and the growth margin progress the team has made is actually enabling us to continue to double down on investments, drive market growth, and drive our own consumption and share within that. Specifically on China, to the second part of your question, Lauren, I think it's a good way to look at China excluding\nSK-II, as you suggest. We are making sequential progress.\nThe share in the most recent read is flat, and our shipments or our organic sales in China are improving quarter over quarter. If we look at Q2, our organic sales excluding SK-II in China were down 10%. In the most recent quarter, they were down 3%. So we're making progress. The market is not yet recovering, but we see the trajectory going in the right direction. We have pockets of strength. Baby care, for example, in China has grown 11% in the current quarter. Our appliance business is growing 14%. We are making strong investments in our haircare business with a more streamlined portfolio, and we feel good about our ability to continue to drive market growth, be market constructive\nin China, and see the upside, as we've articulated before, on a longer term on participating in the Chinese market. Will it be a straight line to recovery?\nNo, it probably takes a few more quarters before we turn back to growth, but we see the trend line improving.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, great, and good morning, everybody. Andre, I think you mentioned that nearly all of the commodity benefits that you expected this year, you've essentially fully benefited from through the third quarter. We've seen year-to-date in the calendar year rises, obviously, in oil resin components. I guess just some thoughts on that in terms of how that impacts your early planning for fiscal 2025. Maybe sort of related to that, just your confidence and your view, visibility into the productivity pipeline. Can we expect and do you have confidence you can run at an accelerated cadence of productivity over the next 12 to 18 months as well based on that pipeline? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, Steve. Yeah. So commodity benefits, as we've mentioned in the script, and you correctly state, have been really impacting fiscal year to date results. Any remaining change, and we see obviously the impact of oil running up a little bit and also other commodities like pulp, for example, where the supply situation is a little bit tighter, are coming up. There will be some impact on the current fiscal year but given flow through of contracts and various holding policies, I expect that to be limited. And we've anticipated that within our updated guidance ranges. So no impact to the current fiscal year. Obviously, if spot prices hold, you correctly state, it will have an impact on next year.\nBut I do feel strongly about our ability, and I think we've proven it over the past two years, that with a combination of strong innovation, good reasonable pricing combined with that innovation, and strong productivity, whatever comes our way, we'll be able to handle. On the productivity pipeline, I feel very good about where we are. We have now, across all businesses, a three-year, what I would call a productivity master plan, which is something that we invested a lot of energy and time on in each business to make sure that we generate enough ideas, even those that take longer to implement, specifically as we work with our retail partners and we work with our supply chains to really\nfundamentally improve the efficiency of some of our combined processes. We have great visibility over three years. The pipeline is sufficient to what we need it to be.\nSo the part I feel really strong about is productivity. It's fully in our control, and I think the teams are doing a great job creating projects and creating visibility to a very strong pipeline over the coming years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, Brenda. Good morning, everyone. Andre, I was hoping if you can elaborate a little bit more on the flat price mix in the US in fiscal Q3. Are you seeing any downtrade within your portfolio, or is that self-inflicted as you offer more IGM on the lower price points or anything about packaging that we shouldn't be aware of? And also related to that, I saw you mentioned in your release about the pricing-related volume declines in baby care. Is that mostly China? Is that anything you can elaborate, or is that also the US? And I think to Steve's commentary about commodities and question about commodities, anything you can talk to us regarding the lag that we're going to see\nthat coming through into fiscal 2025?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Andrea. Look, the flat price mix contribution to organic sales growth in the US is an outcome of simply annualizing the price increases that we had taken in previous periods. That was anticipated, and it's consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the composition of the market growth across the US. The volume component is coming up, getting closer to about 2%, and the value component is coming down. Different players have priced at different points, so that's really the differential between market and us. There is no trade down of note that we can observe.\nPrivate label shares and value shares are actually very stable, 16.4% past one month and 16.4% past 12 months. So consumers are not trading down within the US towards private label.\nIf anything, we continue to see when consumers trade into P&G, which they continue to do because both volume share up strongly in the US and value share up. Once they trade into P&G propositions, they continue to trade up actually within those propositions, be it from liquid detergent to unit dose to Power PODS. We continue to observe that. No worries in terms of trade down. On baby specifically, look, baby is annualizing a very strong base period and obviously was heavily exposed to the commodity run-up and therefore took pricing, and in combination with productivity and strong innovation. The volume decline, I would say, is really differential by region.\nIf you look at China, the business is growing very strongly. It's actually 11% growth in the quarter, share growth of more than a point in China, and that's with birth rates contracting.\nSo the portfolio strength in China is remarkable. When I look at the US, the premium tier, so when you look at Swaddlers, you look at Cruisers and Cruisers 360, those tiers we have been innovating in very strongly over the past 12, 15 months, and they are growing. They are growing share, and they are growing sales. Where we have an opportunity in the US is on the mid-tier. On Luvs, for example, we have not been able to push the full innovation pipeline out for different reasons. And that's what the team really is focused on, to reestablish superiority on those few businesses where we feel that we let value get a little bit out of sync with what the consumer needs.\nBut the plans are there, so now it's a matter of execution.\nSo I feel very good overall about the baby care business, strong innovation pipeline, and that I think will address the isolated superiority gaps that we might have. On commodities, it's very difficult to say when they would actually flow through. I think it's safe to say that there's at least 60 to 90 days of delay. Many of the commodities will take longer to flow through simply because of contract structures that use certain trigger points or holding periods. So I would say at least 60 to 90 days for many of them, probably longer. The only one that tends to flow through quickly is fuel, diesel, obviously because it's captured in transportation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Dara.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo we just touched on pricing. Maybe we can switch to the volume side. Can you just talk about your level of visibility and perhaps a bit of magnitude that you're expecting in Q4 in terms of returning to volume growth going forward? Obviously, a flat result this quarter, but there were some items that depressed volume. They get better going forward in terms of US inventory, SK-II weakness, etc. So just looking for some perspective going forward, particularly as pricing presumably continues to decelerate a bit. And also maybe you can just touch on, given the heavy marketing this year, presumably with the SG&A increases, the level of payback and ROI you think you're getting on that higher\nmarketing in terms of volume. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nOn the volume side, look, I think the effects that we described that are holding us back in the current quarter, the inventory effect in the US of two points, which is a point on a global basis. I don't expect that to hold. So I expect the US to continue to grow in terms of volume beyond the 3% that we're seeing in the current quarter. I expect some of the negative headwinds in China, the Middle East, and SK-II hopefully will improve sequentially. But in aggregate, I fully expect the markets to continue to recover, shift more towards volume growth as we've seen consistently over the recent periods. And since we're growing or holding volume share in most geographies, that will also flow into\nour results. So sequential progress on volumes, many open questions still, but I expect the line to point upwards. On marketing spend, you're right.\nWe continue to invest in reach frequency with strong quality of communication across the markets. We are very diligent in pre-ROI analysis and very diligent in post-event analysis to ensure that we understand whether the spending is effective. If you look at the results, I would argue it is. The strongest combinations of great product innovation with a very sharp consumer insight translated into a great copy drive strong results. If you look, for example, at our skin and personal care business, Old Spice and Secret total body deodorant, great consumer insight, great product, great packaging, strong communication, and the business is growing 11% in North America.\nIf you look at our home care portfolio, those are categories that are expandable. Swiffer PowerMop, for example, getting new users to use Febreze plug-ins. Those marketing investments grow the market, and they grow our share within the market.\nSo expandable categories is a big investment area for us. So we continue to drive high levels of discipline. We will not spend if there's no ROI. And you're right, we're watching the same and asking the same question to ensure that we remain on the right side of that line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Andre, just to pick up on that last point, I guess if we think about year to date and I guess as it translates to the full year and the base, we have some headwinds that shouldn't recur, right? The weakness in corporate chemicals, the destock that you just mentioned, SK-II, I guess, being more negative than overall market in China for the reasons we know. So I guess as we kind of think about next year, right, and confidence in being able to be in line with long-term organic sales targets, does the comps make it easier? Should we be thinking about the macro environment maybe not being supportive?\nJust try to put some context around the organic sales growth this quarter, right, which decelerated from the last quarter.\nJust, is there anything we should be thinking about as we start thinking about our models for next year? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Hey, Bryan. I would point first to the market growth expectation, which we said we expect markets to be in the range of 3% to 4 in terms of value growth. And that will be a combination of two points of volume and one to two points of price mix. That is still our assumption. Our role per our growth algorithm is to be growing slightly ahead of that by driving market growth, which in turn will drive share and a bigger part of us leading the market. So that would be my answer. On the current fiscal year, obviously, by reiterating guidance of 4% to 5 and being right in the middle of that range fiscal year to date, that means mathematically we expect Q4 to be in the 4% to 5 range.\nIf you project that out, I think with the market growth dynamic I was describing, I think that will give you a good starting point for next fiscal year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick clarification on your guidance. You maintain your FY24 organic sales growth of 4% to 5%, but that implies a step up of growth in Q4 to get to the high end of your range. So I guess I wanted to clarify if you still expect to be at the high end or should we assume coming in at maybe the midpoint of your top line guide for the year is more realistic? And then maybe just a quick question on your SG&A expense, which did step up quite a bit during the quarter. So just maybe hoping for a little more color on the drivers of this. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Morning, Bonnie. We did not reiterate the top end of the range, but we reiterated the range. And that means 5 is still possible. Is it probable? I don't know. Probably more 50/50 than it was before. So the range is valid. I wouldn't point today at the top end of the range. On the SG&A line, we continue to invest in marketing as we discussed in previous question, and we really saw an increase in our marketing spend of about 14% year over year. That's the main driver. It's offset by productivity on the SG&A line, but really I would point to continued investment, productive investment to drive market growth and push out our innovation.\nAnd that's the main driver of the SG&A increase that you've seen.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you. My question's about mix, which flattened out this quarter after about a year and a half of improvement. So clearly, you guys have been adamant that we're not seeing trade down, but as you look at this, how much of that is trade up is just harder to do now. You've obviously been very successful of late with Powerwash, EZ-Squeeze, and PODS, etc., etc. So is that becoming harder? And could you talk about mix expectations over perhaps the next 12 months? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Thanks, Olivia. I don't think the fundamental dynamic in terms of consumers trading into the P&G portfolio and trading up is changing. We've not observed it over the past two years, and we've not seen it in the most recent period. There are some drivers and headwinds to mix. The biggest headwind I would mention is SK-II being down 30%. It's our highest value per or one of the highest value per unit items, and that obviously has a material impact on mix. Outside of that, we really don't see in any of the regions a significant downtrading within our portfolio. As I mentioned, in the US, we continue to see trade up.\nActually, the premium tiers on baby care doing better. I mentioned that in the context of Luvs.\nSo we continue to think that the way that we innovate, providing value with innovation and showing the superiority of our premium items in the portfolio is resonating with consumers. And as long as we do that and as long as that value is real and tangible for consumers, I think we can hold on to that mixed trend that we've seen consistently.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nChris, you still there? We can't hear you.\n\nOperator\n\nChris, your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nNow we can.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. Just regarding that, just one quick follow-up on the organic sales range for the full year. The slight change, and I know the range is still in scope, can you just frame maybe how much of that was the inventory dynamics in the US, maybe a little bit less pricing in Argentina versus anything that has fundamentally developed through the quarter? And just connected to that, if you could, you mentioned the elasticity dynamics in baby and feminine care in the press release. Can you just comment on what you're seeing from a broader perspective, specifically as you may need to contemplate some incremental pricing next year with the moves we're seeing on the cost side? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Chris. I think you gave the answer on the organic sales line. It's exactly that. I think Argentina, as we said, the peso requires a little less pricing. That's an impact on organic sales. And the business is also smaller and responding maybe more aggressively to the pricing. So that is one building block. The other building block, I think, is the biggest one is really the US inventory reduction. So as I think about the step up that we need to see in order to be within that 4 to 5 range, we assume that that inventory reduction is a one-timer, and that's what we expect in the guidance range. The elasticity in general is not changing. I think we've done, and you see it in the results.\nI think the teams have done a very good job of making sure that we maintain a healthy value equation for our retail partners and our consumers with strong innovation, with pricing, only pricing where necessary, balancing pricing with strong productivity. So I do feel overall the business is responding very favorably even after we had to take the pricing that we took. The volume is coming up as we would have expected both in the market and for P&G. Our biggest geographies were growing volume share consistently. So I do feel overall the elasticity is doing well. Baby is a very elastic category. And especially, as I mentioned, we've not been able to consistently innovate across all tiers.\nAnd that actually is a confirmation of the model.\nSo where we've not been able to push the innovation out and hold the full level of superiority as we took pricing, the consumer is responding. We know the answer to that, which is push the innovation that we know how to do and communicate the superiority. I'm confident that we'll recover the elasticity here. I don't see a broader issue. Actually, I see a lot of upside with the strength of the innovation pipeline going into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to come back, please, to Andrea's question on trade down. I think, Andre, you had pointed to the stable private label market share as a sign that there is no trade down. And I want to push back on that a bit. I think we all know that the consumers under the most pressure at the moment are the low-income consumers, many of whom were probably already using private label products in the first place. And so my question is, is it not possible that volume reductions and cutbacks amongst the low-income cohorts sort of who were already using private label a year ago are offsetting the trade down impacts and sort of masking that\ntrade down in that flat market share number that you're talking about? And that could also explain why category growth has weakened so much.\nI guess just to add to the question, I'm surprised that private label market share is the metric that you're pointing to to justify lack of trade down. Just wondering, do you not track consumers longitudinally over time to measure trade down and what consumers are doing? Is private label market share really the best metric that we have to track this?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nFair questions, Callum. Look, I'd be worried that the phenomenon you're describing would be a driver if, A, the volume in the market wasn't growing, which it is, and if we weren't able to grow volume share but only grow value share. So I don't think that's the case. We're growing volume share. The market is growing in terms of volume. And one of the hypotheses I would have for you is that a lot of our consumers are actually not switching with private label heavily at this point in time. On the metrics that we use, look, private label share is the most visible metric that we can point to, and it's also visible to you. So it's one that is convenient to use and objectively verifiable.\nSo that's why we're using it. Internally, obviously, we use a lot more detail.\nWe track exact consumption by tier, by product form, by retail channel. We check our share versus competitive share at that level of detail. So there's a lot more internal discussion on, do we see trade down within our portfolio? Do we see trade down across our portfolio with competitors to lower tiers? But private label is just the most visible and robust measure that we can point to that is visible to you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector and Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning. I wanted to go back to the US market. The 5% consumption level was pretty strong, and we see in truck channel data. Are you expecting from a reporting standpoint to get closer to that level in Q4 as you don't have the negative impact from the inventory, or what are the puts and takes in Q4? And then just specifically on laundry in the US, your largest category, there were some recalls in Tide PODS recently. So maybe you could talk about any potential impact from that in Q4. And then longer term, you announced the innovation on Tide evo. So maybe some color on the rollout of that brand and that product and your expectations. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Hey, Filippo. You're right. We hope US market growth continues in the high fours, low fives. And I think the trend line is pointing in that direction. And unless we see any major inventory reduction, I would expect us to continue to trend in that same direction. We are driving market growth in most of our categories in the US, and that should mathematically then result in stable to increasing shares both on the volume and value side. And that's certainly the objective the team has on all the US businesses. The laundry recall, it was a very limited recall on a packaging defect on one SKU on Tide PODS.\nOut of an abundance of caution, the team decided to recall the product. It's no impact or very limited impact actually on the quarter or the fiscal year.\nAnd again, that product itself is safe, so no issue with the product. It was a small packaging defect, but in any case, the team decided to go ahead and recall. We're very excited about the evo innovation. The fiber spinning innovation has been one of our core developments. So seeing it in market is exciting, but it's very early. So we run these test markets to validate product-market fit, validate the commercial execution, validate everything from packaging color to packaging sizes. And it'll take us a few months before we have anything of substance. But yes, the innovation is very exciting, but it will take time before it has an impact on overall laundry growth in the US.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Two follow-ups. First, can you talk a little bit more about Europe? Very strong market, and your results have been extremely strong. So perhaps what's driving the strength of the market, your market share gains, and is this something that you think can flow through into 2025? And then second, kind of coming back on China, there's been significant channel shifts that we're noticing, certainly in the beauty area. It's 50% to 60 online with TikTok being half of that. So kind of number one, wondering to what extent you're adapting to that and are prepared to adapt to that shift. And then second, for the non-beauty business, do you also see the online\nbusiness moving to TikTok as well? And maybe talk about your share online and offline in those categories, the main categories in China. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Robert. Indeed, Europe results have been outstanding. Aggregate Europe, between Europe focus markets and Europe enterprise markets, we now have, I think, 12 consecutive quarters of 5% or higher growth, which is outstanding. I think the strength of the business; maybe let me focus on the focus markets here for a minute. The strength of the business has been consistent because of the execution of the team. Strong innovation pushed out over an extended period of time as we were taking pricing. Very strong productivity work in the region across every part of the P&L to limit the amount of pricing we needed to take.\nBut brilliant execution of the pricing that was taken, respecting key price points, respecting retailers and consumer constraints. I think that's playing out.\nWe've also invested very strongly, probably more than ever, in terms of marketing support of those innovations in the focus markets. We are building the same digital capability in terms of consumer targeting to become more effective and efficient with our spend in Europe that we've used in the US for an extended period of time. All of those would be contributors to growth. On the enterprise market side, I would caution, it's not without headwinds. Russia continues to be a headwind that we called out with a reduced portfolio and very little support of the business. We have work to do in Turkey as Turkey recovers from the heavy inflation-based pricing and some of the Middle East\noutflow of tensions. It's not without headwinds, but I think the underlying performance of the European business continues to be strong, and it's built the right way.\nYou're correct on the channel shifting in China. Obviously, Douyin is a significant driver, most heavily probably in beauty. We've been talking about this before. What we want to make sure is we keep a healthy balance between building brand equity versus simply low funnel transactional execution via KOLs that only make sales via deep discounting but don't do anything for the brand equity or for our superiority messaging. That's what we're doing. We're building brand houses on Douyin. We're making sure that we have a good balance between transactional communication and equity communication. We have innovation that is launching on Douyin first.\nHead & Shoulders Premium would be a good example of most recent innovations. So we're playing in the channel, but we're playing with a sense of value creation and balance between top-line growth and profitability.\nThe channel is relevant for other parts of the business as well, and the same principles apply. We are careful to ensure that we are balanced across top-line and bottom line, and we protect and grow underlying brand equity.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Andre. And good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. Maybe one quick housekeeping. Can you maybe just help us understand how much of the stronger earnings guidance was related to the improvement in FX? Andre, I know the FX guidance became more favorable, but I think you also mentioned you're reducing your exposure due to the divestiture in Argentina. So I just want to make sure I understand the moving pieces as it relates to the FX impact on the earnings range. And then just a quick follow-up on SK-II in China. I think month-to-month improvement was mentioned. So just any color you can provide on the exit rate relative to the 30% decline in the\nquarter, I think would be pretty helpful. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nOkay. Morning, Peter. Yeah, the foreign exchange headwind is an interesting one because the $400 million reduction, as we said, was all related to Argentina. We had assumed in the previous guidance that whatever exposure is generated in Argentina will have to be offset with pricing within the fiscal year in Argentina. So as the assumption changes and the business size reduces, the net outcome to the P&L is very limited. So yes, we saw a technical reduction because of the improving peso and the lower, smaller size of the business. The net effect to the P&L will be very limited because of the underlying assumption we made from the very beginning that we would\noffset that impact of FX via pricing in the market. SK-II in China is, I think, bottoming out in terms of the shipment pattern.\nAs we said, we're about 30% down in the quarter. It's very encouraging to see some positive signs in terms of consumer sentiment as the team continues to innovate. The team drives very strong communication on the core benefit space of the SK-II proposition, focusing on Pitera as a core ingredient and reason to believe. We are leveraging, continue to leveraging the core consumer in China, very loyal to the brand, to amplify that messaging, and it's starting to resonate. So we see positive signs. It will take time until that translates into shipment flow. I think retailers are sitting on a little bit of stock, and I think they will be hesitant to order until they see good signs of\nconsumption increases. So I would caution, I don't expect this to be a fast recovery. This will take some time.\nMaybe last point on SK-II outside of China, the business is doing very well. We're growing double digits in Japan. So I think the fundamental proposition is healthy. We just have to sort through this period in China. And again, we're pointing, I think, in the right direction, but it will take time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nNik Modi\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a few kind of housekeeping items. Andre, just wanted to confirm that the de-stocking in the US was isolated to the consumer health business. And then the other two questions I had, the Tide evo, the technology that you've developed, would that be applicable to other brands and other cleaning solutions within the P&G portfolio? And then just the final thing is, I think there's a lot of the theme I'm hearing just broadly from speaking to investors along this call is the delta between obviously how P&G is performing and how everyone else is performing.\nAnd I think the competition that you're dealing with, I think generally are struggling for volume growth. So as you think about guidance, how much have you contemplated a step up in competitive spend? Right?\nI understand the fact that you guys have a momentum and you're gaining share and the innovation's working, but I just wanted to get an understanding of kind of how measured your guidance is in relation to potential competitive response. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble",
    "content2": "All right. Thanks for the question, Nik. Destocking in the US was broadly personal healthcare related. That was the biggest effect in, again, an okay season, but significantly weaker than last year, and generally an industry-wide recovery of the supply chain. So if you're a retailer, you no longer see the need to hold safety stock. You're convinced that when the season restarts and you need product, you can order and you'll get it. There was some of that also in the Tampax business, in the tampon business, as we have stabilized the supply chain there, similar dynamic. And there was a little bit of destocking in haircare because we had upstocking in the base, but the majority of it, to keep it\nsimple, is healthcare. Indeed, the evo technology, so the fiber spinning technology, is a technology that can be applied in broader context.\nWe've applied it to facial cleaning in beauty, and there are many other applications. This is one of our platform technologies, if you think about it. The ability to spin chemistry into a fiber and avoid water as a carrying agent has so many efficiencies and advantages in the chemistry that we can put together, and obviously in the logistics and cost side that, yes, we would want to apply it, but step by step, we got to make sure the evo's proposition works well, and that's why we're in test market, and we talked about this earlier. Competitive spending, if done the right way, would be a good thing. If we see competitors innovate, if we can see competitors communicate in market\nconstructive ways, drive incremental spend in marketing dollars, that's a good thing. So we hope to see that.\nOn the promotion side, we don't really see a dynamic that would point to anyone escalating promotion. We see stable depth of promotion in Europe, a little bit of increase in frequency. In the US, we are operating at about 85% business sold on deal, which 85 index versus pre-COVID level, sorry; that's about 29% of business volume sold on deal. We see competitors at similar ranges, and it's stable over a period of time. Again, if we see market constructive spend, great. Nobody seems to have an interest in heavy promotion at this point in time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, everyone. Good morning. I guess as we get towards the end of the call, putting a lot of it together, lots of information on volume, on organic revenue, also why it should get better sequentially. I think putting that in the context of what your earnings have grown year to date versus the guidance of 10 to 11, implying almost a flat for Q, I think that suggests a very significant step up in reinvestment or maybe in something else. So can you maybe just try to reconcile each of those pieces?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Kaumil, the main driver here is the profile of some of the tailwinds and headwinds. I don't expect a major step up in spend quarter over quarter. I think we will sustain good investment levels. And again, as I said, we will be ROI-driven. So it's up to the teams. But I don't expect a step up as the main explanation of why Q4 looks different in terms of EPS growth. The main driver is a lot of the commodity help has been booked in the front half of the year. And if anything, there's a little commodity hurt coming in Q4, as we talked: oil potentially, as reflected in diesel rates, and maybe some of the pulp impact will hit this fiscal year.\nAnd then the foreign exchange rate, so forget about Argentina.\nI think we've discussed that, but the balance of the foreign exchange rate will mostly hit in the second half, and that's heavily in Q4. Then the last element is just base period. Q4 last year was very strong because of a different profile. This profile looks a little bit different for the reasons I explained, but don't expect a material change in spend behavior. It's really more of the macro drivers that impact the profile.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. One follow-up on SK-II. Last quarter, you talked about your research suggesting that brand sentiment was improving. I didn't hear that. I guess, is that still the case? Are you still doing more work on what's going on, I guess, specific to what's happening in China? And then more broadly, reinvestment has just been considerable this year, obviously, because gross margin has expanded, or at least in part because gross margin has expanded so much and allows you to do that. As you think about the setup from here, commodities unknown, but probably not as big of a tailwind, net-net, and pricing clearly not as big of a tailwind as\nit's been. So as you go into next year and you presumably have a little less gross margin to play with, how do you think about what the reinvestment levels look like?\nWhat is the contribution? I mean, I know it's a squishy question, but how much contribution do you think you've had from 300+ basis points of reinvestment back into the business to drive share volume, value, etc.? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Mark on SK-II, I think the brand sentiment has been sequentially improving. The work the team is doing on innovation, on communication, and credentialing, I think, is resonating with the consumer. And as the overall sentiment towards Japanese brands is improving, we are also getting a bit more bold in the breadth of the communication, the reach and frequency that we use. So I think all of that is pointing in the right direction. As I mentioned, I think the order behavior might lag. So we might see improvement in consumption before we see improvement in shipment. So that's why I was cautioning that while we see consumer sentiment improving, that first\nhas to translate in increased consumption, and that then has to translate into increased orders and shipment, and that will take some time.\nSo the team is doing the right work, and I'm glad they're actually doing it in a very balanced way to ensure that we're rebuilding this brand for the long term. In terms of spending, I think this will really be done business by business, geography by geography. So it's hard to give you an answer. The only thing I point to is we are planning on significant productivity to continue in the marketing spend area. So that in and of itself would be somewhere between $400 and 500 million of productivity in the space. That is always up for discussion. Do you reinvest or do you flow it through? And it will really depend on the level of innovation we are able to drive.\nMore innovation means more spend and hopefully better return. And I'll leave it at that in terms of the ROI.\nI think I've answered the question before. It's there in the aggregate discipline of the categories, but I wouldn't want to go into more detail. I think it's really down to the category country combinations at which we measure it and at which those decisions are made.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Today's final question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Cooper\n\nManaging Partner, Consumer Edge Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. One follow-on next question. Over the last two quarters, some of your peers or competitors have talked about elevating their rate of growth. You touched on this a bit before, but I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity or capacity for category growth rates to elevate further if more players are deploying strategy that you execute. How do we see that come through with respect to volume or price or mix? Then just finally, if there's anything that you need to do with respect to elevating innovation more or do anything in light of what may be a more competitive environment on that front? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Look, I think if more of our competitors adopt a market constructive strategy and innovate and spend in that way, that's good for everyone. If you look at the category development globally, there's still so much opportunity to grow, even in the most developed markets, to grow category penetration in places like fabric enhancers. That is a big opportunity. In many of the markets where we play, the category development index is index 30 or maybe slightly higher. There's plenty of opportunity to be market constructive. That's a good thing. We are constantly looking at our superiority and our innovation.\nThat's inherent in the strategy of irresistible superiority. We've talked about resetting the bar. We've done that with exactly that in mind.\nWhat will it take for us to continue to be market constructive, win consumers for the next five years instead of just looking back at the success we had over the past five years? So that is part of the growth model and part of how the organization operates. All right. Thank you for your time today. If you have additional questions, John, myself, we'll be available during the day. Thank you for your time, and thank you for your interest.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for the October to December quarter. Jon will add perspective on our recent results and strategic focus areas, and capabilities. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2024 and then take your questions. October to December was another strong quarter. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market share results and another quarter of strong margin progress, delivering strong earnings and cash results for the quarter.\nThe strong results we've delivered in the first half of fiscal 2024 enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners. We continue to see the upper range on organic sales, and core EPS as likely outcome for fiscal 2023-2024. Moving to Q2 numbers, organic sales grew 4%. Volume rounded down to a decline of one point as continued volume acceleration in North America and Europe focus markets was offset by softer shipments in Greater China, Eastern Europe, and Middle East Africa regions due to local issues in select markets. Pricing contributed four points to sales growth, consistent with the guidance we provided. Mix was neutral to organic sales growth.\nGrowth across categories continues to be broad-based, with eight of ten product categories holding or growing organic sales this quarter. Home care, hair care, and grooming grew sales high single digits. Fabric care, family care, feminine care, and oral care were up mid-single digits. Baby care was in line with prior year. Personal health care was down low singles against a very tough comp and a late developing cold and flu season this year. Skin and personal care was down mid-singles due to SK-II in China. Growth was also broad-based across geographies, with North America, Europe, Asia Pacific focus markets, and Latin America and Europe enterprise markets each growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter, and enterprise markets grew 7%. Organic sales in North America grew 5%, with four points of volume growth.\nOver the last five quarters, volume growth in North America has been -3%, flat, then 2% growth, +3%, and now +4%. Strong acceleration well ahead of the underlying market trends. Europe focus markets were up 7%, with three points of volume growth. As expected, both regions saw a step down in pricing contribution to sales growth as a large portion of price increases from last year have annualized. Importantly, volume accelerated in both regions to partially offset the pricing impact. Latin America delivered another very strong quarter with 17% organic sales growth. Continued strong results in these regions. There are some targeted issues affecting other markets. Greater China organic sales were down -15% versus prior year. Underlying market growth was down mid to high single digits as consumer confidence weakened further.\nThe SK-II brand in Greater China was down 34% due to soft market conditions and a temporary headwind for Japanese brands in the market. Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving, and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half. Underlying market trends have softened in some European enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey following multiple rounds of pricing to offset inflation and due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 28 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was up 20 basis points versus prior year. US volume share was up 50 basis points, reflecting strong volume growth.\nValue share in European focus markets was up 90 basis points over the past three months. In summary, North America, Europe focus markets, Asia Pacific focus markets, and Latin America, which combined represent three quarters of company sales, delivered over 6% of organic sales growth in Q2, with three points of volume growth and three points of price mix. These same markets grew 9% in Q1 with around two points of volume growth and seven points of price mix. Continued strong organic sales growth with accelerating volume growth to mitigate the anticipated annualization of pricing consistent with our guidance. The balanced 25% of company sales, including Greater China, Eastern Europe, and Middle East Africa, were impacted by local market issues we described. Q2 organic sales for this group were down five points versus prior year.\nWe expect most of these effects in these regions to be temporary or annualizing. SK-II consumption is sequentially improving. We continue to expect China market growth to improve and over time return to mid-singles, and we expect market pressures in the Middle East and Turkey to ease over time. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.84, up 16% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core operating margin increased 400 basis points as 520 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation, and foreign exchange impacts in SG&A. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 470 basis points. Productivity improvements were very strong. 340 basis points helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%.\nWe returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall progress in the first half of the year, keeping us on track for our fiscal year guidance ranges. Now I'll pass it over to Jon for his perspective.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by underscoring a few points Andre made in his discussion of the top line trends. Overall, continued strong top line progress. 22nd consecutive quarter of 4% or better organic sales growth. Volume acceleration in key markets. Increases in aggregate market shares. This despite several notable headwinds, which should be temporary. Tensions in the Middle East will hopefully ease. Enterprise market volume impacts following price increases are usually temporary. While we can't talk specifics of future pricing in any market, more stable foreign exchange and commodity costs will ideally reduce the need for additional large price increases. I spent six days in China with the team two weeks ago. I met with consumers in their homes, with retail CEOs, with our team, and with several government officials. In my view, the long-term China opportunity remains intact.\nThe near term is likely to present some challenges. We'll see what happens with the global cough cold season as a soft start to the season either reverses or eventually annualizes. No guarantee of immediate bounce back in any of these, but reason to believe they will improve over time. In addition to continued aggregate top line progress, a very strong bottom line. Mid-teens Core earnings per share growth two quarters in a row while increasing investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth. Our team continues to execute our strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past five years: pre-COVID, during COVID, and through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle. I want to thank them both for what they delivered and for what they're working to continue to accomplish. Our integrated strategy is unchanged.\nA focused portfolio of products and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies for several years. The announcements we made in December to change our go-to-market approach in Argentina and Nigeria will further sharpen our focus and strengthen our value creation potential. A good example of the dynamic nature of our strategy and our desire to aggressively allocate resources to where they create the most shareholder value. Next strategy element, ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners.\nThe plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than at any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights, communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands. Priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. Smooth Tear Charmin Ultra Soft with scalloped edge perforations, a great example of consumer insights driving innovation to improve the end-use experience. Consumer response to the new product has been overwhelmingly positive and is driving word-of-mouth recommendations in social media. Gillette's superior propositions, like the GilletteLabs razor, with an exfoliating bar that removes dirt and debris before the blades, continue to drive growth in the global grooming category.\nGilletteLabs has reached shares greater than 20% in markets like Spain and France and is building momentum in the US and China. The global grooming category is on track for $1 billion of retail sales growth this fiscal year, with Gillette driving 2/3 of the increase, well ahead of our global share. Superior innovations like Dawn Power Wash and Dawn EZ-Squeeze in the US and Fairy Power Spray and Fairy Max in Europe are disproportionately driving market growth in hand dishwashing, with value share in the US approaching 67%, nearly 50% across Europe focus markets. Third strategy element, productivity. Improvement in all of our operations to fund investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth to mitigate cost and currency challenges and to expand margins and generate cash.\nWe're re-accelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings and cost of goods of up to $1.5 billion before tax. Visibility to more savings opportunity is increasing, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like Supply Chain 3.0. We're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain, end to end, versus simply trying to optimize each piece. One example, using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We're also using AI tools to optimize fill rates and for dynamic routing and sourcing optimization. Two to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity. More efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach.\nWe're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. The team has delivered strong cost savings in the first half of the year and plans to build on this momentum. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry. A willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends, technologies, and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we've designed and continue to refine an empowered, agile, and accountable organization model.\nAlso, an increasingly diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. So strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas we've outlined previously. Supply Chain 3.0 is delivering productivity as we just talked. We're also driving improved capacity planning, greater supply agility, flexibility, data transparency, scale, and resilience, all the way up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this is driving higher quality, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course, better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strengthen what is already the top-ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys. Environmental sustainability. Superior propositions for consumers, customers, and share owners that are sustainable.\nDriving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint, and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. A good example is the four-chamber Ariel Platinum PODS innovation that we launched in a new cardboard package. Extending our superiority advantage in product performance while improving sustainability by enabling great wash results even in cold water, already contributing to a two-degree Celsius reduction in wash temperatures in Europe against a five-degree target. Also extending packaging superiority with a more attractive and more sustainable cardboard box. Digital acumen. Leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value.\nFourth, the superior value equation for all employees, inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages, and abilities, for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain, and develop the best talent in our best position to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not new and separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe that there is merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society, and shareholders. Now back to Andre for guidance.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Jon. Thanks, Jon. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer, and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong first-half results enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. This outlook includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that we began to see in our Q2 results as the market lapsed the last waves of cost recovery pricing. For P&G, we expect the pricing contribution to top-line growth to reduce by an additional one to two points in the back half of the year. We will continue to price for new innovations when warranted and to mitigate FX impacts.\nOn the bottom line, enabled by very strong earnings growth in the first half of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal 2024 core earnings per share from a range of 6% to 9% to a range of 8% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. This guidance implies slower bottom-line growth in the second half. As we highlighted last quarter, the second half of the fiscal year will see less pricing benefit as we annualize more prior year increases. We will also see less commodity cost benefit in the second half. Wage and benefit inflation continues throughout the supply chain and in our direct costs, and FX headwinds will increase versus the first half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we continue to expect organic sales and core EPS growth toward the upper end of the renewed guidance ranges.\nWe estimate commodities will be at a headwind of around $800 million after tax in Fiscal 24 based on current spot prices. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to expect foreign exchange will be a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax for the fiscal year. The vast majority of this impact is driven by Argentina and is heavily skewed towards the back half of the year. This outlook is based on a forecast for continued significant devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect to largely offset with appropriate price increases. We now expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%.\nWe expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 to $6 billion in common stock. Combined, the plan to return $14 to $15 billion of cash to shareholders this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain superior value for consumers and retailers. Now I'll hand it back to Jon for closing thoughts.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe continue to be very pleased with the strong results P&G people are delivering in a challenging operating and competitive environment. Continued excellent execution of an integrated market constructive strategy. I want to thank each of them for that. While we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we remain confident that the best path forward is to double down on the strategy that has enabled strong results and remain committed to delivering balanced top- and bottom-line growth, and value creation for shareholders. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have a question, please press star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, press star followed by two. Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys. So just wanted to focus on the back half. Clearly, the 4% Q2 core sales growth result wasn't as strong as the 7% Q1 delivery, which is a very robust result. So obviously, some quarterly volatility here. Can you just give us some perspective for the fiscal back half relative to Q2 in light of that first-half volatility as you think through some of the key geographies and volume versus price mix, and some of the temporary impacts Jon mentioned? And then just same question on EPS, basically. Obviously, very strong first half that continued in Q2. Full-year guidance implies a more muted second half. So is there some conservatism baked in there? Help us understand that. I know Andre touched on it, but maybe give us a bit more detail there on the back half from Andre's perspective. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah, morning, Dara. Let me start, and Jon will add. On the top line, if you look at the first half, we are right in line with what we're projecting for the year, an average of 5%, and we obviously then expect about 5% for the back half. We see volatility, as you had pointed out, in some geographies that we mentioned in the script. I think the core point, though, is the core geography. 75% of the sales are performing very well. We continue to see acceleration in volume growth in North America with 4% volume growth, 5% sales growth. Europe is very strong. Latin America is very strong. We continue to see volume acceleration in most places. So that gives us confidence that that projects well for the second half of the year.\nWe also expect some of the volatility that we experienced in Q2 to disappear or at least improve in the second half. The SK-II sentiment is improving based on our consumer research in China, and we are continuing to drive innovation, equity investment, and really relying on our most loyal and passionate user base to help amplify that messaging, which is working well. So we expect the effects to improve year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. From an enterprise market standpoint, we also view the pricing impacts that are impacting some of the markets like Turkey to disappear over time as pricing in the market is established. Competitive pricing catches up. Then the impact of the tensions in the Middle East certainly, hopefully, will improve as well.\nSo very strong continued performance on the core markets, which are 75% of the sales, and we expect somewhat improving trends, and stabilization in the other 25%. On the EPS side, very strong performance in the front half, 17% in Q1, 16% in Q2 sets us up well for the upper end of the guidance range, which is reflected in the tightening of the guidance. However, to keep in mind, we see a reversal of a number of effects that have supported the half one results. We saw the majority of the commodity help flow through in the first half, and this is part of the improvement in Q2 EPS. We see the flow through happening faster than we would have anticipated in some instances. So that leaves less of a contribution for the second half.\nWe also have the majority of the foreign exchange hurt in the second half. About 75% of FX hurt of the $1 billion will hit the second half. As we indicated, the majority of that is Argentina, so we will try to offset via appropriate pricing. Nevertheless, the growth impact is tilted towards the back half. Price mix contribution will ease. We saw still significant contribution in the first half. That will lower by one to two points in the back half, which also has an impact on EPS growth. And lastly, we continue to see wage inflation in our own operation as well as in our supply chain flowing through. Now, that being said, if everything goes well, could there be upside? Sure. But we believe that guidance is appropriately reflecting the potential variability here. So those are the core drivers. Jon, any perspective?\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI have nothing to add on Andre's bottom line perspective. I would just reiterate one thing and add one thing on the top line. There are two questions that we've been discussing as we've gone through the first half of the year. The first relates to our ability to re-accelerate volume, which we've talked about several times in this conversation this morning. And I just want to reiterate how encouraging that progress has been. We've said it before, but it's worth saying again, in our largest market, North America, past five quarters, -3, 0, +2, +3, +4. Europe, which tends to be fairly price sensitive, volumes +3. So that gives us confidence in terms of the momentum of the business on a forward basis.\nThe other thing I would just call out that adds to this discussion is the breadth of the top line progress that the team has been making. 8 out of 10 categories held their group sales in the quarter that we just completed. 21 of our top 25 brands did the same. And if you look at our top 12 brands, nine of those are growing at high singles or better rates. And that's inclusive of all the challenges that we're managing around the world. So that gives us confidence that the top line growth that we've been delivering should continue, just as Andre said. And that should provide the ability to continue to deliver decent levels of bottom line growth as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I want a clarification, Andre, to your answer to Dara's question, and then I have a question. So the clarification, I think when you responded regarding organic sales growth for the back half and tracking to the year, the 5%, is it that Procter is tracking to 5% organic sales for the year, or were you saying an expectation for 5% organic sales growth for the back half? I wasn't quite sure if you were talking full year or specifically about the back half.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey, Brian. No, what I was talking about was the full year expectation. So again, we reiterate the range of four to five, but we see the possibility and strong probability that we'll be able to deliver towards the upper end of that range for the fiscal year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. So with the very sizable gross margin delivery this quarter and the outlook for the full year, there's a ton of reinvestment going back into P&L, right? And this quarter, you called out the specifics, but I think also that's pretty well implied for the second half as well. So I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about incremental areas of reinvestment because the basis points are big and the dollars are even bigger. And so I don't know, it might sound ridiculous, but it gets to a point where you start to worry externally: is there an excessive amount of reinvestment? So I'd love it, Jon, if you could talk through your perspective on that, on making sure there's not money effectively being spent less efficiently in the P&L simply because you have that much flexibility. Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nAre you saying, Lauren, that you want 30% core rates for share growth? Just kidding.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nWell, that's kind of what I'm getting at, right?\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. All right. I'll speak first on this, and I'm sure Andre has some perspective as well. But if you look at the amount of innovation that's coming to market, both currently and in the future, and if you look at the opportunity to fully penetrate households with that innovation in ways that delights them and improves their lives, now is not the time to be pulling back on investments in marketing or commercialization efforts of that innovation. And that's where the majority of the incremental spend has come from and will come from. We look very carefully, I don't want to ignore your question, on the effectiveness of that spend and continue to see through the addition of many tools and data sets that we can increase the effectiveness of that advertising, increase the return rates of that advertising, as you see in our bottom line, while increasing reach.\nSo that's what we'll be focusing on. We'll be very disciplined in that effort. Neither Andre or I or the rest of the team has any desire to spend money that isn't working for us.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. And maybe just to add, we just talked with our team actually about being very granular about the assessment of the ROI. So we don't have good investments cover for bad investments. So really go down to the country level, to the brand level, to the channel level when we assess whether we are getting a payout on the investments. But the majority of the spend, as Jon said, is really focused on driving market growth. When you think about the opportunity on FE, for example, we've created 100% of the market growth in North America on FE, and it's still the biggest opportunity the team has in order to continue to accelerate both our own growth in a constructive way and the market, given the low penetration FE has fabric enhancers.\nOral-B, another example, Oral-B iO, we've launched Oral-B iO10, and we're also expanding distribution of Oral-B iO3, 4, and 5. We've led 70% of global market growth with those launches. So communicating the benefit and driving penetration is a huge opportunity. So be assured, we look at ROI very carefully. And again, market growth continues to be the main area of focus when we invest incrementally.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nTerrific. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on the state of the consumer in your two most important markets, the US and China, how consumer demand developed through the quarter and into January. And when you talk about China, if you could also touch upon travel retail and maybe what SK-II was on a Greater China basis, including travel retail as well. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'll start. Morning, Robert. Look, the US continues to be very solid, continues to impress with, I think, a very smooth transition from pricing annualizing and overall consumption coming up in terms of volume, which is enabling us to post the volume improvements Jon was quoting over the past few quarters and still accelerating ahead of market with 4% volume growth and 50 basis points of market share growth. We continue to see trade-up within our propositions. So as consumers come in, maybe at a lower tier and a lower value proposition, they continue to trade up in the US, which speaks to the health of the proposition, but also the health of the consumer, and willingness to invest. The last data point I'll give you on the US is we are able to grow as private label shares are slightly up. We are up the same range.\nSo some consumers will look for value in private label, but an equal, if not higher, amount of consumers find better value in our propositions as we drive continued superiority via innovation. So we feel very strongly about the US. We'll continue to invest to drive more market growth there, but the consumer is resilient and the business is doing well. On China, I'll begin. I'm sure Jon has an incremental perspective, but the China opportunity remains intact. If you look at the underlying market size, if you look at the potential development of the middle class, if you look at the ability to drive category penetration in our categories, all of those are huge opportunities for us. And all of those point to continued investment and commitment to the Chinese market. We have a very capable organization, and we continue to be very optimistic that we can create value.\nHonestly, when the market requires market growth to be driven by manufacturers, I think that positions us very well with our retail partners in China to have a competitive advantage and execute the model that we know how to execute in many parts of the world. In the short term, we mentioned it in the script; consumer sentiment is not fully recovered yet, and that is reflected in the results. Again, if you want to take a silver lining, we see the attractiveness of key opinion leaders and heavy discounting in key consumption periods decreasing. And that's actually good for us. And we believe that a focus on brand equity, a focus on strong everyday value via superiority will allow us to help grow the market back to mid-single digits and strengthen our position in the market. Last point on SK-II, no specifics.\nThe numbers we're quoting, obviously on the quarter, -34%, include the domestic travel retail channel. Nothing else to add there other than we remain confident that as the sentiment improves, which we see already with continued investment in SK-II, we see that business recovering over the back half.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nRobert, as Andre suggested, I'll just provide a little bit of additional color on China, having spent a fair amount of my career involved in that market and having just spent almost a full week there. In digesting the Q2 numbers, the P&G numbers in China, you have to think about a couple of things. One is SK-II, which just for clarity for everybody, is really driven by an anti-Japanese brand sentiment, which Andre described in our opening remarks, that's related to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear facility.\nAnd we've had not identical, but similar consumer sentiment dynamics in the past as it relates to this brand and as it relates to the relationship between those two countries. And it has always resolved itself with SK-II moving to higher heights. So if you look at the decline in China on the quarter on our business, I don't know the exact number, but basically think of it as 50% of that being the dynamic I just described and 50% of it being the market dynamics. The second thing that Andre referred to is important to understand as well. The heaviest purchase period historically in China was in November. I'm talking years past. And that was always a little bit disconcerting for us because a disproportionate amount of product moved during Double 11. It filled consumer pantries. It filled some retailer pantries. It often or inventories and warehouses.\nIt often moved at heavily discounted prices. The amount of movement during that period this year was much lower. As Andre said, we view that as a good thing. It's a temporary impact, a quarterly impact, a Q2 impact on the indices. But it moves us into a healthier position. If you think about the medium to longer term, Andre mentioned the expected addition of 200 million middle-income consumers to China's population. That's very encouraging. Also, I mentioned I was in homes, I was in stores, I was with our retail partners. They remain encouraged about the future of China. I was talking to our organization at the end of the trip, our organization in China.\nAnd I told them I had never seen as much alignment in the market between our intentions and our strategy, our retailers' intention and their strategy, and the government's intention and their strategy, all focused on what's being referred to as quality market growth. As Andre suggested, that's a very good thing for us. We can play very effectively and help with that agenda, help society on a parallel path. And so you put all that together, and I agree with Andre, and I said it earlier, I think the growth potential here remains intact. There are some specific items that exacerbate the trend that you're seeing on the quarter, but I expect this will continue to be a source of both growth and value creation for P&G. Sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Good morning. At the risk of provoking another long answer, I guess what struck me this morning is just the confidence and front-footedness, if that's a word, in both of your comments this morning. I think, Jon, your strategic perspective just struck me as particularly assertive. I say that in the context that, on the outside, I think, faced with some of the market challenges you've called out in China, the Middle East, et cetera, this quarter, concerns grow that P&G is likely to be thrown off course or maybe getting complacent. My question is, why is that wrong? What to you are the keys to keeping the organization's eye on the ball, focused, grounded, and executing on all those strategic pillars that you went through?\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Steve. I want to step back first. We do face a lot of challenges in the world that we all live in, and those have impacted our business. But stepping back probably five years, the level of challenge has always existed, whether it was COVID, whether it was the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, whether it was the 50% reduction, 5-0, in our profit over two years as a result of commodities, foreign exchange, and transportation costs. And this organization overcame all of that. They've overcome the challenges we faced in the last quarter. And that gives me a huge amount of confidence that we have the ability, the skills, the strategy, and the agility to continue to meet challenges face-first and work through them in ways that are constructive for consumers, for customers, for employees, for society, and for share owners.\nWe talk a lot internally about the complacency and the evils associated with it. So it's front and center in our thought process. I have a couple of kind of trite sayings that I use in communicating with the organization, and one of them is that complacency kills. You don't see a complacent organization when you're looking at the breadth of growth that they're delivering. When you're looking at the continued, after a decade, continued work on productivity, yielding the kind of margin progress that we saw this quarter, you don't see it as they reinvest that into growing markets and to growing household penetration and shares. We're not immune to it, so you're right to raise it.\nBut I feel, as you said, I feel the organization, not just myself, are very much on their front foot as they move to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. I've frankly never seen as many opportunities. Now, there's a lot of work associated with capitalizing on those opportunities, and there will be lots of challenges and forces that will be working against us in that endeavor. But the accomplishments of the midterm past, the most recent past, the reflection of the work that the organization is doing all the way down the income statement, and the innovation progress that I'm seeing not only in market or coming to market, but as we review the pipelines across each of the categories, also give me a good degree of confidence.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Jon, I wanted to go back to China. You mentioned clearly that there was an impact from the cycling of the 11/11 shipment. And can you give us some sense of how down was China and SK-II during that period and maybe some of the exit rate coming out of December that gives you some confidence in the improvement in the country in the second half? Thank you.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI apologize. I honestly don't operate at that level of data aggregation, so I don't have the answer with any degree of specificity. But I know the impact was there. I know it's a good thing for us, long-term. And, apologize, but I'm just going to leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Chris.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThe US volume growth improvement is very constructive. It's quite a bit better than what we can see in the US Nielsen data, for example. I know the data is far from perfect, but I wonder if you can just help characterize whether you have any non-track channel boost or, in general, talk about some of the specifics of what has really driven this volume improvement over the past five quarters. I think maybe just connected to that, if you could, there's a lot of debate right now across consumer staples around just what does drive volume improvement, whether that's promotional activity, increased advertising, or just the lapping of pricing. I find it interesting today that this dynamic of sequential volume growth.\nI wonder if you can just maybe talk about, in general, why this seems to be happening, what you're doing to drive this, or whether this is just the natural evolution of markets post substantial pricing. Thanks so much for that.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah, hey, Chris. Let me start. On the non-covered channel side, we've seen non-covered outpace covered channels for a period of time. This is not different. There's nothing specific happening there. We see a trend of some consumers going into larger pack sizes. Those are in club. Those are online. And many of those effects continue, but there's nothing differential between covered and non-covered channels. Both are performing well. Non-covered a little bit ahead of covered, so that's why you don't see the results in the track data. What's driving the growth? I would argue it's all of the above that you've mentioned, right? I think we're seeing pricing lapping, consumers seeing the pricing normalizing on the shelf. We don't see an increase in promotion depth or frequency, quite frankly. We are still operating at about 85% of pre-COVID levels from a volume sold on deal perspective.\nCompetition is in a similar range, so there's no escalation of promotion. But what drives it is strong innovation, innovation that is focused on growing the market and strong communication of that innovation in a very targeted way, leveraging our capability to be very detailed and very intentional on who we talk to at what point in time with what messaging. And the US is probably our most sophisticated market in that regard, and it shows in the ROIs and in the results back to Lauren's question earlier. Few examples, just the Gillette business, innovation on the core with the GilletteLabs razor provides a growth driver. But adding new jobs to be done, like female facial hair removal or male and female body hair removal, incremental jobs that, when communicated appropriately of the benefit of the product, drive incremental consumption. I mentioned Oral-B, penetration still low on the electric toothbrush.\nAnd as we're converting more and more users, that drives incremental growth with more innovation, but also expansion of the lower-priced options of Oral-B iO3, 4, and 5, and then the launch of Oral-B iO10. Last example I'll give you, and then I'll let Jon add, is OLAY Super Serum. Just to cover a few of the categories here, it is a new serum, the most successful new serum in the category. 30% of those users are new to the category. So again, communication, strong innovation, premium propositions, and bringing new users to the category is what's driving that accelerated volume growth.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'll just pile on with, I agree with everything that Andre said. Just a couple more examples to show you, again, the breadth of the innovation that's being commercialized currently. He talked about OLAY, very exciting innovation in our haircare business as well. An example, Head & Shoulders BARE, which is a more efficacious anti-dandruff offering with the bare minimum number of ingredients, nine to be exact, in an eco-friendly package, 45% less plastic. It's one of the drivers of growth, particularly in North America, on the Head & Shoulders brand, which is up 8% fiscal year-to-date. Another example, in a different category, Swiffer PowerMop, which is driving that business up 11% fiscal year-to-date and has built both volume and value share at about a point-and-a-half level.\nSo, that's it, and back to Steve's question on complacency. This is what we need to keep doing. That's why we talk about the best path forward being doubling down on exactly these things. They do drive market. They do drive volume. They do drive sales, and they do it profitably.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to that 4% volume growth commentary in the US and 3% in the EU focus markets. And despite the tough comparison for the cold and flu season, it seems that you had market share gains in laundry and some other key categories. So can you comment on how you exited the quarter for the cold and flu season in the US and in Europe? And separately, it seems like you secured more distribution in the balance of this fiscal year. So any comment on that? And a clarification on China, you said that you're confident that the growth will resume to the mid-single-digit level. I'm assuming that's not a comment for this fiscal year.\nAs you commented on, Jon, in terms of Head & Shoulders, and I know haircare is a big category there, and you're comping easy comps in hair. So I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on SK-II in particular. Thank you.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nLet me just take China real quick and then turn it over to Andre on the cough, cold trend, et cetera. The mid-single-digit number that we referred to is an expectation of longer-term market growth. You're correct. It is not an expectation of ours for either the market or our business in this current fiscal year. On the broader beauty question, when you take SK-II and the market impacts in China out of the equation, you see a business that's performing extraordinarily well. I mentioned Head & Shoulders, which is the largest shampoo brand in the world, up 8% fiscal year to date. If you look at North America Pantene fiscal year to date, up 15%. Our skin and personal care business up double digits. The same is true for the beauty business in enterprise LA and in Europe.\nSo it's a very strong business benefiting from the exact same strategies, obviously applied differently, that we're executing across the balance of the company. And that will, over time, as the market corrects itself, be demonstrated in China as well.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nSo on the other two questions on PHC, Andrea, look, the business is obviously very, very strong, past four-year average growth rate of 13%. So the underlying strength of the business is very healthy. We see an impact of the cold cough season. The season is still above average, but it's below a record season last year. And it's developing a little bit slower in the current profile, which means there could be some upside coming as time goes by. Last year, Vicks was 28% in the same quarter, so you can see the high base that we mentioned in the prepared remarks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nJust one thing on that. Sorry to interrupt, Andre. I think it's relatively straightforward, but it's worth mentioning. As we were all coming out of COVID, going through our first non-COVID or light COVID cough cold season, it's not surprising having spent time in our homes for the last two to three years that the level of immunity was not high. And therefore, the level of incidence was very high. So that's what we're annualizing against, combined with a slower start to the normal season. As Andre says, we'll wait to see how that all materializes. We have seen some increase in incidence. You can probably hear a little bit of a frog in my voice this morning, and I heard one on Andre's.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nRight. We're contributing. There we go. Hey, just last point on PHC. If you look at the share development, in every treatment area that we cover in PHC, we're up in share. In every treatment area, we're up in organic sales across regions. So again, it's purely a seasonal element. On distribution, Andrea, I won't give you an answer other than obviously driving innovation, driving incremental sales for our retail partners, driving category growth helps with their desire to have our brands present on their shelves.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS",
    "content2": "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I know you maintained your commodity outlook this morning, but just given the first half performance, the outlook does not imply as much of a tailwind from here, which you alluded to, Andre. Can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing across your key cost buckets? Where are things getting better? Where are things getting worse? And maybe just based on current spot rates, how should we think about the phasing? Would you expect deflation in both Q3 and Q4, or is there any potential for cost to become a headwind as we exit the year? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHey, Peter. The commodity basket is wide, complex, and changing very quickly. So the best guess we have is what we told you, $800 million of tailwind for the year, which the majority of which has been flown through the P&L in the front half. What I'll leave you with, I don't expect any headwind from commodity in the second half. It continues to be a tailwind. The second thought I leave you with is the impact on the P&L, given the time it takes for commodity changes to flow through our contract structures and our own variance holding policy, makes the time lag significant. So even if we saw significant volatility on commodity spot prices, the impact on the fiscal will decrease over time simply because of those two dynamics. But continue to expect tailwinds, just less than you saw in half one.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJason English\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in and a belated Happy New Year to y'all. A couple of questions. We've talked a few times about the North America volume strength. I had in my notes that you're lapping some under-shipment that should have been a couple-point benefit to this quarter, yet I don't think you've mentioned it so far. So A, am I wrong? Was there not a sizable transitory benefit this quarter? And then it's encouraging to hear the confidence that you're expressing around sort of it sounds like an imminent improvement in SK-II with words like recovery and improvement throughout the back half. With the decline sort of half related to Japan boycotts and half related to market conditions, where are you seeing the improvement? Is that dissipating concerns around Japanese brands, or are you actually seeing improvement in market conditions? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nSo the volume, we don't see a transitory effect on the volume side, Jason. Morning, first of all. So the base, there's always some base volatility, as you know, in terms of inventories, in terms of our ability to ship, but there is no material impact that I would call out that would have to be taken into account as you look at the US volume results. So nothing there. The SK-II improvement, again, I want to pace expectations, but the improvement is really in the consumer sentiment that we're seeing, where we had very high social media coverage in Q1, leading to negative sentiment and negative top-of-mind awareness of the brand. That is now dying down. And honestly, most consumers have gone back to a neutral position, open to SK-II.\nAnd so what we're doing is really doubling down with innovation and doubling down with communication on the efficacy, the quality of the product, the quality of the brand, and leveraging the most loyal and passionate consumer group to help us make the case for SK-II, which we believe will help us improve run rates in the second half. The market dynamics we continue to see bumpy even over the next quarters, improving, but there will be volatility there.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nIt's just an N of one, Jason. So it's kind of irrelevant. But I was in the home of a heavy SK-II user in Beijing, and I asked her about this dynamic and how it was affecting her purchasing. And she kind of laughed. And it wasn't the normal nervous laugh. And she said she followed that up with, If Japanese consumers aren't afraid of this, why should I be? And she said, I'm much more afraid of the pimple that I will get if I don't use this than I am about. So it's starting to normalize again. That's N of one. It was also interesting to me to see what was happening with her kind of personal inventory and just looking at the liquid fill levels in the bottles, which were low.\nSo I think there's a dynamic as well where a number of consumers just kind of waited to see how this whole thing played out and reduced their personal stocks in the process. But again, that's probably neither here nor there, but I thought it was worth sharing.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning. My question, guys, is about your enterprise market restructuring, which I think in the release you describe as substantial liquidation of the affected markets in places like Argentina and Nigeria. And I guess, look, recognizing that these are not huge markets for you today, from a profit perspective, this still feels like a fairly extreme decision and clearly a challenging macro backdrop today in those markets, but in the case of Nigeria, probably one of the highest long-term potential economic markets. So my question is, Jon, I know these enterprise markets were your baby, so to speak, for a number of years. Just hoping you can walk us through what I imagine must have been a difficult strategic decision.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah, these decisions are not taken lightly. A couple of points. One is where we're moving to an import model, which will be the case in Nigeria. We maintain an option on the future of those brands in those markets. We're just choosing to operate in a way that's, frankly, is viable. You get into some tough situations in some of these markets with currency controls, with pricing controls, with the ability to dividend money out of these markets. And at some point, you run into a set of conditions that just make it impossible to operate. You can't source dollars, as an example, in order to purchase the ingredients and raw materials you need to manufacture your products.\nAnd so we've come to a decision when those situations present themselves to be pragmatic, to be value-creative, and to flow resources to bigger opportunities that present more near-term opportunity, while in some cases maintaining our optionality on the long term. Andre, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah, I just want to clarify because the strategic intent really is what Jon described, right? We are moving in Nigeria to an import market. We will still be present, but it's a better way to serve the consumer and a better way for us to create value. In Argentina, we are divesting our fabric and home care business and, again, are looking to find a better go-to-market model. The language you're quoting, Callum, is substantial liquidation. That's an accounting term. And that accounting term is really defining the point at which we recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss in those markets, which is part of that non-cash restructuring that we talked about. So the accounting term doesn't represent the business execution. It is a technical term that once we get to that point of substantial liquidation, we will recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nBy the way, the prior CFO would have had no hope of explaining that to you as eloquently as the current CFO just did.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI won't comment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Clearly, you've generated some impressive growth in the US and Europe, so I wanted to bring it back to the developed markets. And you've held on very nicely to price. So I wanted to ask you about competitive response and any pushback from retailers or increase in promotion from competition given the share gains you've made, and whether you're seeing any response there. Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYou want to talk competitive promotion, Andre, and then I'll talk customers.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nHappy to. Hey, Olivia. So I started to mention this in the US. Our promotion level is still below pre-COVID, about an 85 index, competitive promotion level around a 90 index, so very similar. We don't see a substantial increase in either depth or frequency in the US. In Europe, we do see an increase in frequency. We do not see any increase in depth. Actually, both frequency and depth are still below pre-COVID levels, but frequency is increasing. So competitive environment is still stable. And I think it's also driven by the fact that we are driving growth. We are driving market growth. And that contributes to the share growth, which means we can grow, but also it doesn't drive necessarily negative cycles in terms of pricing in the market.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThe whole idea, just building on Andre's last point there, is to create business, not take business. And that works out well for us. It works out well for the categories that we compete in, and it works out well for our retail partners. And that is really the focus of the existing interchange with our retail partners. It was number one, two, and three supply. As we've solidified our supply chains, the conversation moves very quickly to how do we work together to grow markets. That's a win-win win proposition, a win for them, a win for us, a win for consumers, and of course, adding a fourth win for share owners. So that's the state of play. And I experienced that in Europe. I experienced that. I was in Europe just before Christmas. As you know, I was just in China.\nThat was the nature of the conversation there. It's clearly the nature of the conversation here in the US.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to China for some of the break time, I guess, on this call. The last quarter, you guys had talked about a portfolio structure examination. I guess I'm curious whether there's any updates on that or what even does that mean. Maybe specifically, any underlying changes in consumer attitude towards beauty as a category, including what is perceived to be relevant by brand or efficacy? Also sort of related to that, it just seems a bit more of a fickle category, more trendy category than some of the others that you're in. I guess I'm specifically talking in China as opposed to globally. You can sort of parse out that, I guess, if you want.\nAny thoughts on maintaining a presence in a category that has more subjective sort of usage than some of your other categories on everyday usage? Thanks.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nI'd offer a couple of thoughts there. One, China is our second largest market, sales and profits. Beauty represents a significantly disproportionate amount of the business. So if we weren't committed to the beauty business in China, you'd have to ask yourself a different question. Second, when we did our significant portfolio restructuring, however many years ago that was now, into daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, we did the same with beauty. Exiting the most fickle, to use your semantics, portions of the business, we exited what I call fashion, fragrances, and flavors. The brands that we have remaining and the categories that we play in, there's real opportunity to drive long-term loyalty with superior performance. That's true in China. That's true outside of China. And there will always be a higher trial rate in that category than in many other categories. That's not a bad thing.\nIt helps demonstrate the superiority of what we do offer, and people come back to our brands. So if the question is commitment to beauty in China, the answer is yes.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Lewis\n\nPartner, Redburn Atlantic\n\nYes, thanks very much. We've been accustomed to strong performance in the US for a number of years, but notable to see the strong performance in Europe again with volume and price. I guess that comes at a time when there's plenty of scrutiny over here on pricing levels. So can you talk more about what's behind the strong results for Europe at present?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nLook, I think the execution of the strategy in Europe is really behind the strength of the results. The team has done a fantastic job in combining the price increases that needed to be taken to recover the commodity cost increases with very strong innovation that delights the consumer at the time when they see higher pricing materialize on the shelf. And that's really behind the benign volume impact as we took the pricing and behind the acceleration of volume growth now that pricing is established in the market. We've done that. A few examples. Jon mentioned Ariel. I'll mention Ariel as well. But Ariel pods in a more sustainable packaging launched with the price increase that we needed to take has been building organic sales by up to 20% or higher.\nThe results are really a combination of strong innovation, pricing, and therefore maintaining consumers coming into the franchise and trading up, not different from the US.\n\nJon Moeller\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Procter & Gamble\n\nWe convinced ourselves for years that what mattered most in Europe was price, specifically the lower, the better. That wasn't an uninformed decision. You had the highest development of heavy discounters, for example, in Europe, which would indicate that price is an important part of the consumer value proposition. But as Andre said, in the last number of years, we've really pushed innovation as a driver of value, not forgetting about value, but delivering it through performance. That, combined with the executional capability of that market, which has just been phenomenal, and I want to thank them all as long as you've given me the opportunity to do that, has led to just really terrific results, and I believe sustainable results. Great. Thank you for your time this morning. I know it's a little bit of a difficult quarter to unpack. There's a lot going on.\nThe net of that, although, is very positive, strong, really strong earnings per share growth, while increasing investments in the business, both present and future, maintaining top-line momentum, building volume momentum, and building share. As I expressed before, I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve a level of success going forward, and that's based entirely on both the strategy and the ability of our organization to deliver against that. Look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a month or so, and we'll advance the conversation at that point. We're around. John Chevalier is sitting across the table from me right now. He's around all day. Andre's around. They'll get angry if you call me, so call them. But have a great day.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Have a great day."

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its investor relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nGood morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is Jon Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. This fiscal year, Jon Moeller, Chairman, President, and CEO, will join the mid-year and year-end calls, and I'll be leading the Q1 and Q3 calls. Execution of our integrated strategy drove strong results in the July to September quarter, broad-based organic sales growth across categories and regions, global aggregate market share growth, strong productivity savings enabling increased investment in superiority of our brands, while also delivering very strong earnings growth. These strong first-quarter results put us on track to deliver toward the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth and core earnings per share, and continued strong cash productivity and cash return to share owners. Moving to first-quarter numbers, organic sales grew 7%, pricing added 7 points to sales growth, and mix contributed 1 point.\nVolume rounded down to a decline of 1 point, with overall modest volume growth outside Greater China. Top-line growth was broad-based across business units, with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care grew low teens. Personal health care was up double digits. Feminine care, oral care, fabric care, hair care, and grooming each grew high single digits. Baby care and family care were up mid-singles. Skin and personal care grew low singles. Growth was also broad-based across geographies, with five of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 6% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 7%, and Europe focus markets were up 15%. Greater China organic sales were down 6% versus prior year. Underlying market growth is soft and choppy as consumer confidence remains weak.\nSK-II was down low teens in Greater China due to soft market conditions and a temporary reduction in social retail merchandising. Enterprise markets were up 13%, with Latin America up 19% and Europe enterprise markets up 15%. Shipment volume in the U.S. grew 3% again this quarter, and we returned to volume growth in Europe focus markets. Mexico, Brazil, and India, some of our largest enterprise markets, continued to deliver solid volume growth. These gains largely offset volume declines in the Greater China, Asia-Pacific, and European enterprise regions, primarily driven by underlying market contraction. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 32 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 50 basis points versus prior year, with seven of 10 categories holding or growing value share in the quarter.\nUS volume share was up 60 basis points, reflecting 3% volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 40 basis points over the past three months. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.83, up 17% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 21%. Core operating margin increased 240 basis points as 460 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation, and foreign exchange impacts on SG&A. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 340 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 210 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 97%. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchase.\nIn summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, a very good start to the fiscal year across top line, bottom line, and cash. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past five years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily-use products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value across each price tier we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy.\nProductivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins, and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in the volatile environment we're in. Finally, an organization that is more empowered, agile, and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with four focus areas: Supply Chain 3.0, Digital Acumen, Environmental Sustainability, and the Employee Value Equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation, and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization reinforce and build on each other.\nWhen executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grows share, sales, and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. Moving to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer and geopolitical dynamics. We attempt to reflect these realities in our guidance ranges. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal 2024. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in July. However, within this estimate, there have been several moving parts.\nWe've seen incremental relief on some commodities like pulp, which have been offset by higher costs in other commodities such as fuel. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us, and we now expect a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax, an increment of $600 million impact since our initial guidance for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits, and we expect higher year-on-year net interest expense of approximately $200 million after tax. As we are just one quarter into the fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for organic sales, core EPS growth, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, which, with each, solidly on track after a very strong first quarter. Guidance for organic sales is growth of 4%-5% for the fiscal year.\nThe range includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that is likely to occur through calendar year 2024 as the market lapses the last wave of cost recovery pricing and as market volumes return to growth. For P&G, we expect 3-4 points less pricing benefit in each of the next two quarters compared to our first-quarter results. On the bottom line, our outlook for fiscal 2024 core earnings per share is 6%-9% growth versus last fiscal year. We're holding the range despite the incremental $600 million after-tax headwind from foreign exchange. With now a 7-point EPS impact from FX, this outlook translates to 13%-16% core EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%.\nWe expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion-$6 billion in common stock, combined, a plan to return $14 billion-$15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. As you consider the cadence of earnings for the year, keep in mind that the back half of the year will see less pricing benefit as we progressively annualize prior year increases. We should also see less commodity benefit as we move through the year. Labor inflation continues throughout the supply chain and in our costs. FX headwinds will increase versus Q1.\nAlso, with a strong start to the year, we'll be reinvesting to further strengthen our plans and to maintain strong momentum. Finally, we'll be closely watching the health of the China market and the balance of regions. Energy costs are rising as we head into fall and winter. Household saving levels have reduced, especially in Europe. Slower economic growth, higher energy costs, and higher interest rates for longer have an impact on consumer confidence. To conclude, while we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we remain confident in our strategy and the results that it delivers. We are focused on driving growth in our categories, and we are committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for our share owners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have a question, please press star followed by one on your phone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, press star followed by two. Your first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Good morning, Andre. I guess just picking up on your comments on organic growth over the balance of the year, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the progression of price versus volume versus mix over the remainder of the year. And then I'm curious as to whether your approach to balancing those various drivers differs at all between your focus markets, particularly the U.S., and the enterprise markets where you're experiencing more of the currency headwinds. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Steve. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect the market to return to a lower, more sustainable growth rate, more in line with historical growth at around 4%. That will have a stronger contribution on the volume side. We would expect that to be around 1%-2% of pricing and maybe a point of mix impact. That will occur over the next few quarters. And as always, P&G is intending to grow ahead of the market. So really, our expectation for the year is to be slightly ahead of the market in terms of volume and slightly ahead in terms of price. We continue to believe that we can price with strong innovation, and we gained even more confidence over the past two years that our strategy of pricing with innovation to drive superiority and create value for the consumer is working.\nSo we fully expect to return to that pattern. And again, pricing has been a core component of our growth for 18 out of the last 19 years, so we expect that to continue. Specifically, I think the pricing will start to lap in Q2. So you will see probably the price contribution drop by three to four points in Q2, and that was expected. And we then sequentially expect volumes to pick up and offset part of that, but do expect a lower overall market growth rate for the balance of the year. To your second part of the question, enterprise markets versus focus markets, I think the only differential would be foreign exchange, and we'll continue to price for foreign exchange. We've done that very successfully across the world.\nTurkey is a major example where we've been able to price for the significant devaluation of the Turkish lira, but we are able to grow share, grow sales, and grow profit. We'll continue that model. Outside of that, we'll continue to do and drive the same business model we're driving in focus markets, innovate, drive superiority, price, grow markets, and thereby grow sales, profit, and share.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys. So just to follow up on that, can you characterize what you're seeing competitively in terms of the pricing environment? Obviously, it'll be different by geography and product category, but in general, what type of behavior are you seeing from your competitors? And any thoughts around retailer pushback as commodities have turned favorable year over year? And just then in terms of volume growth, it sounds like we should expect a return to volume growth. Just what do you think your level of visibility is around that and how much comfort you have in ultimately returning to volume growth as pricing drops at all? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Dara. When you look at the total market, it's very consistent with previous periods. You still see average market growth of around 6%-7%, and you see still the pricing component being a significant driver. Volumes are stabilizing at a global level, minus a point to flat depending on the geography you look at, the only exception being Greater China. So the price component and the price rollover is consistent period over period. So no differentiation there from a competitive standpoint, at least not that we see it. Promotion continues to be promotion levels, and other indicators continue to be below pre-COVID levels. In the U.S., for example, volume sold on deal is now at about 29%. Overall promotion level still index 80 versus pre-COVID. In Europe, we also see promotion still down, and actually sequentially decreasing.\nNow, it's a different dynamic by market, obviously, but when we aggregate up, it looks like over the past few quarters, promotion activity is actually still decreasing. And that makes sense. If you look at the relatively little or small help to commodity costs, we see about $800 million after-tax help offset by about $1 billion of foreign exchange. And recall, we're coming from two years which combined have an impact of $7 billion of headwinds. So I think everybody is still recovering, so the current pricing dynamic makes sense. We have not experienced retailer pushback beyond normal discussions on how to maximize value for their shoppers and for consumers overall. And again, our model of driving innovation and therefore superiority and sales while we price and create value for retailers and shoppers seems to be resonating.\nOn the volume side, we feel very good about where we are in the trajectory of volume growth. Again, excluding China, we are already seeing volume growth of 20 basis points, sequential improvement versus the prior quarters, which we would have expected. And again, that's in the context of 7% pricing still flowing into the market. We expect volumes will continue to grow. U.S. strong, as we said, Europe strong, Latin America, and India strong. So we continue to see us progressing on that trajectory.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Ottenstein\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. I want to drill in on China a little bit. Number one, kind of in the short term, how's the business there progressing? Any visibility or improvement there? And when do you think that may turn positive? And then a little bit longer term or kind of strategically, we are hearing from some of the other companies we talked to that the Chinese market may not be as profitable and attractive as perhaps they may have thought a number of years ago, and that perhaps the nature of competition is changing in China. Again, so I'd love to get your thoughts on both China in the short term and the long term. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nThanks, Rob. Morning. I think we said all along that we don't expect the China recovery to be quick, extensive, or linear. And I think that's playing out. The business health in China is really all driven by market dynamics right now. So total market volume continues to be down. It has been down over the past few quarters between 7% and 9%. Value is down around 5% over the past few quarters, and that's the market I'm describing. So we're operating within a market that is still contracting post-COVID reopening. That said, we do believe that China continues to be an attractive place for us to do business. We've been there for 30 years. We have a very strong organization on the ground, R&D capability, supply chain capability, and commercial capability. The Chinese consumer is a demanding consumer.\nThe Chinese retail environment is a demanding retail environment, and that generally plays to our strength. So we believe that, A, we can play a value-creating role in China, and we expect the Chinese market to return to mid-single-digit growth here over the coming periods. If you just look at the consumer structures, middle-income consumers, we have about 450 million, we estimate, in China today. That will grow probably north of 700 million over the next five years. So there is a class of consumers that we believe are attractive for our businesses, and therefore we believe that our business in China can create significant value over the next few years and will continue to remain invested.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. You'd mentioned the return to volume growth in European focus markets, which is great to see. And obviously, market shares have generally held up well. But we started to see some pickup in private label share trends across Europe. You mentioned the European consumer being under pressure. So just kind of curious, maybe some more broad thoughts there on Europe, on market share trends that you're seeing more real-time versus what's kind of already transpired in the reported results, more of the go-forward look on European shares and volume trends. Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYep. Morning, Lauren. Thank you. Look, Europe, let me focus here on the Western European side because I think that's where your question is relevant. Look, we've seen 15% organic sales growth in Europe focus markets, which is incredibly strong, a combination of 2% volume growth and strong price mix. We have 40 basis points of share growth across the same geographies, which is very encouraging. The market is returning to volume growth, and that generally are positive signs. Yes, private label shares in Europe are growing. They continue to grow at about an 80 basis points clip month over month. But that still enables us to grow share in the same geographies. And I think that share growth is enabled by a strong portfolio across different brand tiers, across different cash outlays.\nThe fact that we are present in all relevant channels across Europe, and that allows us to effectively compete. Even as consumers look at the private label versus branded value equation, the balance seems to be still in our favor.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, Andre. I guess I have two connected questions. One is, if we look at the first quarter and even your commentary about guidance, maybe higher end of the ranges, I know you've talked a lot. You've talked a bit about some of the risks in the market. But just what's been better so far this year is one question. So just that. And then related to that also, you talked about reinvestment. So if you can just give us some sense of kind of the sizing that reinvestment and maybe where those dollars are going.\nMorning, Bryan. If you look at the Q1, I think we are encouraged by the combination of factors here on the consumption side. Again, return to volume growth outside of China. We expect that China to be choppy, as we said all along. But even with China down, we've been able to grow 7%. And that certainly has been encouraging to us. And the depth and breadth of that growth, both across value and volume outside of China, is really encouraging us and giving us confidence that the model will continue to drive results that point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. On the reinvestment side, we will continue to look for opportunities to invest when the return of that investment is attractive. It won't be driven by availability of funds. It will be driven by ability to create an attractive return.\nOur first priority, as you can imagine in this current environment, is to invest in ideas that drive market growth. So investing in products, investing in innovation that is driving new jobs to be done, investing in media spending that is driving household penetration, investing in communication to the consumer that drives usage in the right way to drive better delight for the consumer will be key. A couple of examples. Ninjamas in bedwetters was a sleepy category. We entered a couple of years ago; categories growing 7%. We were able to drive 60% of that growth, which is six times our fair share. Those are great examples where we can continue to invest, drive growth for the business, drive growth for our retailers, and create value for shareholders. We continue to see opportunities in media.\nAs we get sharper and sharper on our targeting across media around the world and our capabilities are scaled, the ROI gets better. So we'll continue to drive up reach. We continue to drive up frequency. And again, that is a core driver for us to drive household penetration, drive trial, which will turn into loyalty and repeat. The last bucket I will give you is investing in supply resilience and productivity. Our supply chain resilience, we see as a core competitive advantage for our retail partners and for ourselves. So we'll continue to ensure that our capacity-to-demand ratio is where we want it to be. And investing in productivity, we believe, has a high payout and is critical for us to continue the investment in superiority, which is part of the business model. So those are the headlines.\nBe reassured, we'll do it on a very disciplined basis with return on investment as the top priority.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. Andrea. Your comments about volume, I would like to drill down a little bit. You mentioned China. I believe you are still looking to a mid-single-digit growth and obviously understand the choppiness of the market. And you had SK-II down in the low teens. So I'm assuming for that to happen, you're expecting SK-II to gradually improve or lap easier comps as we go through the balance of the year. And then when you mentioned doing the math, when you said pricing as we decompose your guidance, right, the 4 to 5 for organic total company, you mentioned expect sequential 3%-4% decline in the benefit of pricing, right? So it was a good 7%. So you'd be implying to us 3%-4% the next two quarters.\nSo with that being said, it implies in the next two quarters some sort of improvement in volume, right, or at least some sort of inflection. So I was trying to figure that out in the context of what you said about China and what you said about total company, basically what it regresses to an improvement in China. Is that what we should be thinking?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nSo, first part, good morning, Andrea. First part of your question, we obviously want to see SK-II return to growth, but the volume impact of SK-II is relatively limited because the volume to organic sales ratio obviously is very high unit sales. So China, we believe, will return to mid-single-digit growth. When exactly that's going to happen is really hard to predict. And I would say, like we have delivered 7% organic sales growth in Q1 with China down, I think we'll continue to operate and not counting on China recovery as the core catalyst to growth for the coming quarters. On your sequential question on volume, you're right. As we said, the pricing contribution to organic sales growth will decrease 3-4 points over the coming quarters. And we expect volume to progress sequentially. The exact trajectory of that progression, I think, is questionable.\nI won't make a prediction here, but I'll tell you that the progress we're seeing from minus six to minus three to flat to minus one to now flat is pointing in that right direction. We see we're on the right path, and we will continue to invest to drive household penetration and create that volume growth in our business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning. Andre, you talked about the changes in FX and how you've been able to absorb that into the fiscal year outlook. Can you discuss what's embedded in your outlook in terms of the consumer, the economy, obviously increasing risk or concerns around trade down, slower volumes, and macros in general? So if you could talk about that and then also your ability and, quite frankly, your agility to switch between spending that is either net to sales versus operating expense in light of potentially volatile conditions. Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Thanks, Olivia. Morning. Look, the consumer continues to be remarkably resilient. As we said, in the U.S., the consumption levels are actually stable. Our volume share and our value share are growing. That's true in Europe and in most parts of the world. I interpret that as our portfolio doing exactly the job that it's supposed to do. Building a portfolio that is grounded in superiority in daily use categories that are non-discretionary, I think, is serving us extremely well. We're able to add value, bring value to the consumer. We are doing that in every tier, not just in a premium tier, but in the mid-tier, and in value tiers across the world, which allows us to serve the consumer even as their spending preferences might change. Now, we haven't seen a significant change in their preference yet.\nIf anything, consumers that are choosing P&G products continue to trade up within our portfolio. But you can see our ability to grow in markets even when we see private label shares expand. And so we don't expect a significant change in that profile. And we believe we are well set up to grow even if the consumer feels a bit more of a pinch here going into the fall or winter season. The main intervention for us continues to be investing in innovation and continue to invest in media support to communicate the strength and the value that our brands can provide. We don't see a significant need to drive price promotion. Our focus, if we promote, if we look for in-store support, is really to drive regimen.\nSo we view it as a strategic tool to drive either trial or habit formation, i.e., regimen steps added to the laundry regime or the haircare regime, for example, because that drives incremental consumption. It drives growth for our retail partners and for us. In many cases, our innovation is strong enough to get in-store support. And that's really what we're after. When the product in and of itself generates enough traffic and consumption for retailers who want to support it, that's the golden grail we're after.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Carey\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning. I was wondering if you could expand on two categories which have been important for volume growth and seemingly should be important ahead. Just first, on laundry, we've seen an improvement, a reacceleration in trend. Can you just expand on what's driving that and the durability? And then second, in personal healthcare, I believe that was an important driver of volume growth in the quarter. Can you just expand on what exactly was driving that in the quarter? And if you think those trends are also sustainable, go forward. So I'm just trying to get a sense of some of the volume durability that we saw in the quarter go forward, specifically in the context of potentially some volatility out of China likely to persist. Thanks so much.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. Good morning. The laundry business is very encouraging. Results around the world are very strong. Let me focus on the U.S. market because it's the biggest market and you have the highest visibility too. But if you look at the trends, they are very encouraging. We are now growing value and volume share in U.S. fabric care. Value share has been flat over the past three months. Volume share has been up 1.6 points. So we continue to push the laundry business forward. We have record high fabric enhancer shares, and we have record high laundry consumption in the U.S. Most importantly, I think, is the fact that we're driving 70% of the category growth in laundry, and we're driving 100% of the category growth in fabric enhancers. And it's really driven by strong innovation, strong superiority, and doubling down on consumer-relevant communication and in-store support.\nSo I fully believe that this will only accelerate. To your question, yes, it is sustainable because it's just in line with the business model. PHC is doing extremely well around the world. Obviously, the seasonality here plays a key role. Going into the season, we see strong results, which is part of the strength and volumes that you see. The last part I'll leave you with is we've invested significantly and continue to invest in strengthening our supply capability in personal healthcare, which will be needed to support that strong growth going forward. But feel good about both businesses. Yes, I think the trajectory is absolutely sustainable.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, Andrea. Just a question on gross margin. Clearly very strong performance in the quarter, big inflection in terms of the year-over-year increase. You seem like you have pretty good visibility in the first half, at least on the commodity front. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking the second half will play out, especially as pricing contribution comes down? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Filippo. Yeah. When we talked about the cadence of earnings, I think it's important to understand the drivers of the gross margin expansion we saw in Q1. We expect some normalization of gross margin. We were certainly benefiting from a high price contribution in Q1. As we said, that price contribution will ease over the coming quarters. The biggest part of the commodity help, about 33% of the $800 million after-tax commodity help, has materialized in Q1. That's a positive to gross margin relative to the balance of the year. The foreign exchange rate headwinds will accelerate over the coming quarters. On the other hand, we will accelerate and continue to drive strong productivity. We will continue to drive trade up and innovation.\nWe continue to drive every other element of productivity, not only in gross margin, but across the P&L and the balance sheet. I want you to take away that the gross margin expansion in Q1 is very strong, but we have headwinds going into the balance of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. And good morning, Andrea. I hope you're doing well. So I wanted to ask specifically on Latin America, 19% growth in the quarter, very strong. And you may have alluded to this, but are you already seeing a return to volume growth in the region? And then just thinking through the performance in the quarter, can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing in terms of broader category performance versus how much of this growth is a function of share gains? Thanks.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nMorning, Peter. Look, the Latin America business is on fire. I think it is on fire because we've chosen, maybe opposite to the market, to double down on superiority. When we saw the need to price for foreign exchange and commodity impacts in Latin America, the team made the choice to double down on innovation and price for the innovation and to offset foreign exchange rate, inflation, and commodities. That clearly has played out well. We are seeing growth in our categories, and we are seeing share growth in Latin America. The growth is both on the volume side and on the value side in the biggest markets, in Brazil, Mexico, for example.\nI think the biggest headwind that we have to acknowledge is Argentina, where it's very difficult to make progress at this point in time, given the level of inflation, some constraints in terms of ability to price. So outside of Argentina, I can only paint a very positive picture of the Latin America growth construction. And again, it's grounded in the superiority of our brands. And I feel very strong about the sustainability of that model.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nThanks. Morning, everyone. Two sort of unrelated follow-ups. One just on China. Given your commentary about the middle class, I think everybody's obviously aware that there's just a growing middle class and that they'll ultimately consume more. But any sort of changes in your view about how quickly the middle class premiumizes purchases? Obviously, SK-II may be sort of a one-off. But any changes there in terms of how quickly you think that they can go for more premium-priced products that potentially change how Procter thinks about its product positioning or portfolio positioning in the market? And then on the gross margin versus marketing spend sort of decision tree, if gross margin moderates, how do we think about the incremental reinvestment or marketing investment from an SG&A standpoint as we go through the year? Would that inversely kind of move with gross margin?\nOr I should say, would it move with gross margin, meaning less gross margin expansion, less reinvestment? Thank you.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nYeah. Morning, Mark. Look, I really don't have any more insights on the China recovery timing. You see the volatility in the market. That will directly correlate with consumer confidence, income levels, and therefore recovery timing. I think we're hoping for faster, but we're prepared for longer. That would be my answer here. On the gross margin versus marketing spending side, when I say we're ROI-driven, I really mean we're ROI-driven. So there's no direct correlation between availability of funds and investment levels. If we continue to see strong response to the marketing spend increases that we deliver in Q1, I think there's a strong incentive for us to continue that level of investment. I also expect that our gross margin expansion and our overall growth contribution availability will continue to enable us to drive strong innovation and drive strong support of those innovations. That's part of the business model.\nThat's why, again, it has to be a combination of driving very strong productivity to reinvest in superiority, to grow markets, and we have to keep that cycle spinning.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Lewis\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nYes. Thanks very much. Another strong quarter in the U.S., seeing both volume and value growth. Just looking back at 2020, when we were dealing with, obviously, a lot of COVID headwinds, you were talking about growing about 4% to 6% as a sustainable rate of growth in the U.S. In light of all that's gone on in the past few years and seeing where we are in the U.S. at the moment with the consumer, are you still comfortable with that range over the longer term?\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nLook, I won't give you guidance on a market-by-market basis. I think what is proving out is that the business model we're driving in the U.S. is very successful. If we are successful in continuing to drive market growth, that will continue to drive sales ahead of that market growth for us while being sustainable because we create business instead of taking business from somebody else. If that model is successful, which I believe it will, I feel very strongly about the growth prospects of the U.S. And again, we're doubling down in every dimension of superiority. We're doubling down in every dimension of market execution. So my overall confidence in the U.S. market capability and growth trajectory is very high. Operator, are there any more questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, Procter & Gamble\n\nOkay. Thank you very much for joining us today. Again, very strong first quarter on the year. We'll look forward to speaking with you. If you have any questions, Jon and I will be available all day. Please feel free to call or email. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results for materially from these projections.\nAs required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n[indiscernible] today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for fiscal year '23 and the fourth quarter. John will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities, and we'll close with guidance for fiscal '24 and then take your questions.\nFiscal '23 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategy continues to yield broad-based strong sales growth across categories and regions. Strong earnings in the face of significant cost headwinds and continued strong return of cash to P&G share owners. Organic sales for the fiscal year grew 7%, our second consecutive year of 7% organic sales growth and fifth consecutive year of 5% or better organic growth.\nStarting fiscal 2019, 5%, 6%, 6%, 7% and 7%. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew mid-teens, Feminine Care grew double digits. Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care, up high single digits, Skin and Personal Care, Baby Care, Family Care and Grooming, each grew mid-singles.\nOral Care grew low single digits. Focus markets were up 5% for the year, and we delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 6% on top of a strong 8% growth comp in the base period. Greater China organic sales were down low single digits versus the prior year, with trends improving in the back half as the market continues to slowly recover.\nEnterprise markets were up 15%, led by Latin America with 24% organic sales growth. E-commerce sales increased 7%, now representing 17% of total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth is, in turn, driving share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 7% in fiscal '23.\nP&G consumption grew ahead of fair share of category growth driving modest value share growth and volume share up 50 basis points for the year. We held global aggregate market share, 29 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based. 7 of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year.\nCore earnings per share were $5.90, up 2% for the year despite a 24 percentage point earnings growth headwind or $1.38 per share from higher material costs and foreign exchange. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS were up 11%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We increased our dividend by 3% and returned over $16 billion of value to share owners, $9 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase.\nMoving to the April to June quarter. Organic sales grew 8%. We've now delivered 7 consecutive quarters with 5% or better organic sales growth. Pricing contributed 7 points to organic sales growth, mix was up 2 points, volume declined 1 point, improving sequentially versus the March quarter as expected. The strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength.\nEach of our 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Skin and Personal Care, Personal Health Care, Home Care, Feminine Care and Family Care, 5 of our 10 categories each grew double digits. Baby Care, Hair Care and Grooming grew high singles. Fabric Care grew mid-singles and Oral Care was up low single digits. Each of our 7 regions grew organic sales with focused markets up 7% and enterprise market up 13% for the quarter.\nOrganic sales in the U.S. grew [ 6 ]%. Importantly, this includes 3 points of volume growth a return to positive volume in our largest market for the first time in 5 quarters. Greater China organic sales grew 4%. We continue to see sequential market recovery, but as expected, at a slow pace. European focus market organic sales were up 12% and despite volume pressure from wider pricing gaps. In enterprise markets, Latin America led the growth with organic sales up 22%.\nGlobal aggregate market share increased 10 basis points, 29 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 22%. Core operating margin increased 190 basis points as benefits from strong sales growth and productivity improvements more than offset higher material costs, foreign exchange headwinds, wage and benefits inflation and reinvestment in higher media reach and frequency.\n[ R&C ] neutral operating margin increased 310 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 136%. We returned approximately $2.3 billion of cash to share owners in the quarter.\nIn summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Strong performance again this year in a very difficult operating environment.\nNow I'll pass it over to John.\n\nJon R. Moeller\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Procter & Gamble Co.\n\nThanks, Andre. I want to talk briefly about this company, its strategy and our organization, both as a step-back reflection of what's been accomplished and as a glimpse forward into what's possible. Three quick reflections looking back. First, pre-COVID, during COVID and since COVID, pre-inflation and sense inflation, consistent strong top line growth across categories and geographies. Core earnings per share growth each of the last 5 fiscal years, a consistent cash return to shareowners.\nOur strategy has sustained us through all of this; second, look back in the past 2 years, nearly half of our earnings wiped out by commodities, transportation and foreign exchange headwinds. Yes, we still grew earnings per share in each of those years. while delivering 7% organic sales growth each year, increasing investment in innovation, brand building and growing markets and growing market share in aggregate in the process.\nAs I said last quarter, if you told me 4 years ago that we would grow top line, bottom line and deliver strong cash return to shareowners through a global pandemic with employees challenged to get to the workplace in the context of a war in Europe, major disruption in global supply chains, rapidly escalating costs, the highest consumer inflation in 40 years and fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and channel relevance, it would have been hard to agree.\nBut that's exactly what this team has done. Over the last 5 years, they've added over $15 billion in incremental sales, growing our share of the global market, growing core earnings per share by 40% and returned over $80 billion of cash to shareowners.\nTwo more granular examples testing both strategy and execution in some of the harshest conditions. Latin America, significant devaluation across all major currencies. Inflation in Brazil peaking above 12%, 9% in Mexico, over 70% in Argentina. Despite this, our team has delivered 3 consecutive years of U.S. dollar sales growth, mid-teens in fiscal '22 mid-20s this year. Market share growth on both -- volume and value basis, nearly 30% profit growth this year in dollars, over 50% on a local currency basis.\nOne more test, Turkey. Over the past 2 years, lira has devalued more than 300%. We've had to take multiple ways of significant pricing. Still, the strength of our strategy and its execution by the organization has enabled us to grow dollar sales, grow volume, sequentially improve market share and maintain dollar profitability in the market. As you well know, past performance is no guarantee of future results and certainly no excuse to stand still quite the opposite.\nThere will be bumps in the road ahead. We're still navigating through plenty of challenges right now. Each of these look backs, though gives us confidence in the effectiveness of the strategy grounded in and focused on consumers.\nAnd an appreciation for the capability of our talented, creative, agile and committed organization. Our integrated strategy, a focused portfolio of products and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. Superiority through innovation across the 5 vectors of product package, brand communication, retail execution and value, holistically defined, leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them, to jointly create value with our retail partners. Productivity to offset cost challenges while funding investments in innovation and brand building and market growth.\nWe're reaccelerated productivity back to pre-COVID levels, with an objective for gross savings and cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity. More efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste. Constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry to adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that often extend our competitive advantage. In an organizational structure that's increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable. An increasingly diverse organization, now with 50% female representation in manager roles across the world.\nWe're strengthening the execution of our strategy [ 4 ] focus areas. First, with Supply Chain 3.0. We're driving improved capacity, greater agility, flexibility, scalability, transparency and resilience along with greater productivity. We recently launched a platform of supply chain services to enable best-in-class service and streamline the end-to-end supply chain. These initiatives have been very well received by retailers.\nOur next step to drive joint value creation with retailers is to simplify our SKU portfolio, to improve the shopping experience, increase on-shelf availability and further streamline supply for the entire ecosystem. Higher quality, more transparency, increased supply assurance and higher on-shelf availability of our product, each improved superiority with consumers, and improves what is already the top-ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys.\nAll of this is a huge value creation opportunity for P&G and our retail partners. Next, focus area, environmental sustainability to create superior propositions for consumers, customers and shareholders while improving our environmental impact, reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges.\nOur third digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value; and fourth, a superior employee value equation for all genders identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. At the end of the day, P&G serves people. with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families.\nWe stand by people and support them in small but meaningful ways every day with superior performing products at a superior value. We strive to do this in the most responsible way consistent with P&G's values and principles. This approach with consumers at the center and an organization built to serve them has served us and our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as we move forward.\nIf we do this effectively, consumers will benefit, customers will grow their businesses, employees will develop and thrive, society will benefit and shareholders will continue to be awarded for their investment, not measured by a quarter or even a year, but over time.\nI believe in this company, in our organization, its capabilities and in the commitment of P&G people to serve consumers. I'm excited about what lays ahead. Of course, I have my worries and concerns and we'll continue to face challenges and some dark days and nights, but the future in general holds great promise. We'll continue to be guided by our purpose, values and principles and relentless execution of our strategy to move forward to an ever-brighter dawn. P&G celebrates its 186th anniversary this year. I believe we have an even stronger hand to play today than we've had historically.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jon. As we've said in each guidance outlook for the past 3 years, and as Jon indicated, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead. And while supply chains and input costs have become more stable as we enter fiscal '24, the challenges we face are multifaceted, economic, geopolitical and societal putting pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets.\nWe'll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy, guided by consumers with every step. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24. Foreign exchange rates continued to be a headwind. And based on current rates, we now expect the $400 million after-tax impact.\nWe still face above normal levels of wage and benefit cost inflation in our cost structure and higher costs for third-party services. In addition, we expect the below-the-line impact from higher net interest expense to be roughly $200 million after-tax earnings headwind. With this context, I'll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 4%, with the drivers of market growth normalizing as we move through the year, pricing becoming less of a driver and volume returning to modest growth.\nWith the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for fiscal '24. On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% versus fiscal year '23 EPS of $5.90. This guidance equates to a range of $6.25 to $6.43 per share, [ 634 ] or up 7.5% at the center of the range.\nWith a 3-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 9% to 12% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year.\nSo top line, bottom line and cash guidance for fiscal '24, all consistent with our long-term algorithm. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges.\nThese guidance ranges also do not assume a further reduction in commodity and material costs versus current levels. If this should occur, it would generate great flexibility to invest more in value accretive innovation and marketing opportunities.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts.\n\nJon R. Moeller\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Procter & Gamble Co.\n\nWe're very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging operating cost and competitive environment over the last 5 years. Excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable balance growth is to double down on the strategy starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. With that, Andre, and I will be happy to take your questions.",

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nExecution of our integrated strategies drove strong results in the January to March quarter. Organic sales grew across all 10 categories and in 6 out of 7 regions. Global aggregate market share is holding steady. Productivity savings are accelerating and enabling sustained investment in the superiority of our brands.\nIn-market execution across all 5 vectors of superiority is strong and consistent: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value. Superior offerings continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and, in turn, for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan enables us to increase guidance for organic sales growth and cash return to share owners and to maintain guidance for core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity.\nMoving to third quarter numbers. Organic sales grew more than 7%. Pricing added 10 points to sales growth, and mix was a modest positive contributor for the quarter. Volume declined 3 points, including a 1 point headwind from portfolio reduction in Russia.\nGrowth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Feminine Care was up low teens. Personal Health Care, Home Care and Hair Care each grew double digits. Grooming, Oral Care and Fabric Care grew high single digits. Baby Care was up mid-singles, and Family Care and Skin and Personal Care grew low singles.\nGrowth was also broad-based across geographies with 6 of 7 regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 5% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 6%, including modest unit volume growth. Europe-focused markets were up 8%.\nGreater China organic sales were up 2% versus prior year as the market begins to recover from COVID lockdowns and as consumer confidence improves. We continue to expect further recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Longer term, we expect China to return to mid-single underlying market growth rates for our portfolio of categories.\nEnterprise Markets were up 15% with Latin America up nearly 30%, and Europe enterprise markets up low teens. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which all 5 sectors grew organic sales double digits in enterprise markets.\nGlobal aggregate value share was in line with prior year with 30 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Excluding Russia, global value share was up 20 basis points.\nIn the U.S., all outlet value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 8 of 10 categories holding or growing share in the quarter. U.S. volume share is up 90 basis points versus the prior year driven by 2 points of absolute volume consumption growth in a market that is still down modestly versus prior year.\nStrong U.S. share growth in Personal Care has been led by innovation on the native brand and deodorants as well as successful extension into body wash. Cascade Platinum Plus has driven strong share growth in auto dishwashing, and Dawn share continues to be up more than 1 point with ongoing leverage from the powerwash and easy squeeze innovations. Vicks continues to be a growth leader in Personal Health Care, and we've delivered strong share growth in the Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol brands.\nIn Europe, the new 4-chamber area of platinum pots are driving strong consumer demand in Fabric Care. Fairy Power Spray is growing the dish category and building market share in Home Care. The new Gillette Labs exfoliating razor, male and female intimate grooming innovations and cardboard packaging upgrades are driving strong growth in Grooming.\nMoving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.37, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 13%, good progress as we faced $0.31 per share of cost and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter.\nCore operating margin increased 40 basis points. That 150 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by SG&A investments and inflation impacts. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 160 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 290 basis point help to the quarter.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity was at 92%. We returned $3.6 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 3% increase in our dividend, again, reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareowners. This is the 67th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 133rd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend.\nIn summary, against what is still a challenging cost and operating environment, continued good results across top line, bottom line and cash for the third quarter. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past 4 years and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice.\nOngoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the 5 vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy.\nProductivity improvements in all areas of operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is incredibly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.\nThere are 4 areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization.\nOur strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior proposition, consumers and retail partners.\nNow moving to guidance. As we work towards the end of the fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic. We remain confident in our strategies and the organization's ability to execute them with excellence. We continue to expect more volatility in the macro and consumer environment and expect sustained pressure in costs and foreign exchange as we move forward.\nOn the whole, our consumer markets remained relatively resilient with U.S. and China volume trends improving, but with inflation pressures in Europe weighing more heavily on consumption. We continue to think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on execution and excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time.\nRaw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation, have largely stabilized over the last few months but still remain a significant headwind versus last fiscal year. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.2 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23.\nForeign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind, and rates since last quarter have moved modestly against us. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact to the fiscal year.\nFreight costs have moderated throughout the year, and we now expect them to be roughly in line with prior year. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.5 billion after tax or $1.40 per share, a 24 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year.\nIn addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits and higher year-on-year net interest expense. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility.\nAs noted in the outset, our strong results over the first 3 quarters have enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 4% to 5% to approximately 6% for the fiscal year. This would put fiscal '23 in line with 6% top line growth we've averaged over the last 4 years, which were 5, 6, 6 and 7 from fiscal '19 to '22, respectively.\nOn the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. Significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as value-creating opportunities are available.\nWe continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We now expect to pay nearly $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7.4 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year.\nThis outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.\nTo conclude, we continue to face highly volatile consumer and macro dynamics. We also continue to see high year-over-year input costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets.\nAs we said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of our business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results.\nWe continue to step forward. We remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements, to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures.\nProcter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, The Procter & Gamble Company\n\nGood morning. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the October to December quarter, growing organic sales in 9 of 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, continued productivity savings, improving supply efficiency, sustained investment and superiority of our brands across all 5 vectors: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn, for P&G shareholders.\nProgress against our plan fiscal year-to-date enables us to increase the guidance range for organic sales growth and maintain ranges for core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Moving to the second quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 5%, pricing at 10 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 6 points driven by a combination of market contraction, trade inventory reductions and portfolio reduction in Russia.\nGrowth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens, Feminine Care, Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Hair Care was up mid-single digits. Baby Care, Family Care, Oral Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up low single digits. Grooming was in line with prior year.\nFocus markets grew 3% for the quarter, with the U.S. up 6%. Greater China organic sales were down 7% versus prior year, as the market continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns and weaker consumer confidence. We continue to expect a slow recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Long term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates.\nEnterprise markets were up 14% with each of the 3 regions up 10% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year with 27 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was in line with prior year with 7 of 10 categories holding or growing share.\nU.S. volume share is up 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter delivering sequential improvement from quarter 1. Recent innovations like Downy Rinse & Refresh in fabric enhancers and Dawn Powerwash in hand dishwashing are extending superiority advantages and driving value and volume share growth. Innovation also serves as a catalyst for pricing across our other brands and forms in their category segments.\nOn the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.59, down 4% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 5%. Core operating margin decreased 170 basis points, primarily due to gross margin pressure from commodities and foreign exchange. Currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 70 basis points.\nProductivity improvements were 110 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 72%, primarily due to a temporary reduction in payables. We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase.\nIn summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, continued solid results across the top line, bottom line and cash for the first half of the fiscal year.\nMoving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past 4 years, and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice.\nOngoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the 5 vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. As discussed during our Investor Day in November, we are renewing our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy.\nProductivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in this volatile environment.\nFinally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly reporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are 4 areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies, supply chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value creation.\nThese are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. We expanded on each of these at our Investor Day in November. If you weren't able to attend or listen in remotely, I encourage you to review the materials on our IR events website.\nOur strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grows share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with commitment to deliver irresistible superior propositions to consumers and retail partners.\nNow moving to guidance. We continue to expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time.\nRaw and pack material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation are still a significant headwind versus last fiscal year though we have seen some modest sequential improvement. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23.\nForeign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind. But like raw and pack materials, we've seen modest directional improvement. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.2 billion after-tax impact for the fiscal year.\nFreight costs remain higher versus prior year, and we continue to expect the $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.7 billion after tax, $1.50 per share, a 26 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year.\nFor perspective, recall that we began the year expecting approximately $1.33 of cost and FX headwinds. So despite some modest relief since last quarter, our current outlook is still $0.17 worse than our ingoing position. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings, we are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility.\nAs we've said before, we believe this is a bottom line rough patch to grow through with continued investment in the business and underlying strategies. As I noted at the outset, our solid first half results enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 4% to 5%.\nWithin this company-wide range, we -- there are many puts and takes. As I mentioned, we expect to see some modest improvement in China, but European markets have softened as high inflation affects consumer spending. The U.S. remains relatively strong to date, and most enterprise markets remain resilient.\nOn the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. The significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as opportunities are available.\nWe continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion of dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges.\nTo conclude, we continue to face high year-over-year commodity and transportation cost inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. These macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G and we won't be immune to the impact. We attempt to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary.\nAs we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward towards our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We are committed to driving productivity, improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we're happy to take your questions.",

We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions.\nExecution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the July to September quarter and provides a solid start to the fiscal year. We're growing organic sales in all 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, accelerating productivity savings and improving supply sufficiency.\nTogether, this progress enables us to maintain guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners despite continued high commodity and transportation costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets.\nMoving to the first quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 7%, pricing added 9 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 3 points, primarily due to lower shipments in Russia.\nGrowth was broad-based across business units, with each of our 10 product categories organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens. Feminine Care was up double digits. Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up mid-singles. Family Care and Oral Care grew low single digits.\nFocus Markets grew 4% for the quarter, with the U.S. up 5%. Greater China organic sales were down 4% versus the prior year, modest sequential improvement in the market still affected by COVID lockdowns and weak consumer confidence. Longer term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates.\nEnterprise Markets were up 16%, with each of the 3 regions up 13% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year, with 26 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was in line with prior year, with 6 of 10 categories holding or growing shares.\nOn the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.57, down 2% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 7%. Core margin decreased 160 basis points and currency-neutral core margin was down 130 basis points. Higher commodity, materials and freight cost impacts combined with a 550 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 120 point headwind. Productivity savings and pricing provided 580 basis points of offset.\nSG&A costs as a percentage of sales were lower by 90 basis points as sales leverage and productivity improvements more than offset inflation and foreign exchange impacts. Core operating margin decreased 70 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 10 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 230 basis point help to the quarter.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity was 86%. We returned nearly $6.3 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $4 billion in share repurchase. In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, good results across top line, bottom line and cash to start the fiscal year.\nOur team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrating strategies that have enabled strong results over the past 4 years, which are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily-use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. So priority across the 5 vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.\nProductivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments is a priority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation; an approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in this volatile environment; finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.\nGoing forward, there are 4 areas we are driving to improve the execution of integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build the priority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Jon touched on each of these in our July earnings call, and they will be a central part of our discussion at Investor Day in November.\nOur strategic choices on portfolios, on priority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which, in turn, grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners.\nNow moving on to guidance. We fully expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time.\nRaw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation, have remained high since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices at latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.4 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23.\nFreight costs have also remained high. Though we have seen some easing in spot prices, we've made a modest downward adjustment in our outlook and now expect a $200 million after-tax headwind for freight and transportation costs in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange has continued its strong move against us as the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against essentially all major currencies around the world. Based on current exchange rates, we forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact, an incremental hit of $400 million versus our initial outlook for the year.\nCombined, headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.9 billion after tax or $1.57 a share, a 27 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. We will offset a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We will continue to invest in irresistible superiority, which is even more important as we compete in some markets with local or non-U.S.-based competitors that don't see the same foreign exchange rate impacts.\nAs we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. As I noted at the outset, our good first quarter results enable us to confirm our guidance ranges for the fiscal year across all key metrics.\nWe continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%. On the bottom line, we are maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. However, the steep increase in foreign exchange impact pushes our current expectations towards the lower end of the range.\nWe continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock. Combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year.\nThe outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.\nTo conclude, the macroeconomic and market-level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we weren't immune to the impact. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business.\nWe're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward towards the opportunities that we may fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nI'll start with an overview of results for fiscal year '22 and the fourth quarter, Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas, we'll close with guidance for fiscal '23 and then take your questions.\nFiscal 2022 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies continues to yield strong sales, earnings and cash results in an incredibly difficult operating environment. We delivered broad-based strong top line growth across categories and regions, earnings growth in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong return of cash to P&G shareowners.\nOrganic sales for the fiscal grew 7%, up 13% on a 2-year stack, up 19% on a 3-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew 20%; Fabric Care and Feminine Care grew double digits; Baby Care, up high single digits; Oral Care and Grooming, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care, Skin and Personal Care and Family Care each grew low singles. Focus Markets were up 5% for the year; Enterprise Markets, 10%.\nWe delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 8%, up 16% on a 2-year stack. E-commerce sales increased 11%, now representing 14% of company total. Our integrated strategies continue to drive strong market growth, and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 6% in fiscal '22. P&G value share continued to grow, up 90 basis points for the year.\nGlobal aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. 9 of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share grew 3% for the year despite a 22 percentage point headwind to earnings from commodities, freight and foreign exchange. Our initial outlook predicted $1.8 billion after tax of headwinds. We ended up at $3.2 billion. So despite an incremental $1.4 billion of earnings pressure versus ingoing plan, we delivered core EPS growth within our initial guidance range for the year.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 5%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 93%. We increased our dividend by 5% and returned nearly $19 billion of value to shareowners, $8.8 billion in dividends and $10 billion in share repurchase.\nMoving to the April-June quarter. Organic sales grew 7%. Pricing contributed 8 points to organic sales growth as additional price increases reached the market. Mix was flat and volume declined 1 point, which is due to reduced operations in Russia. Volume for the balance of the business excluding Russia was up 1 point. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength.\n9 of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew mid-teens; Fem Care was up low teens; Fabric Care grew double digits; Oral Care, up high singles; Baby Care and Family Care, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care and Grooming, each grew low singles. 5 of 7 regions grew organic sales with Focus Markets up 3% and Enterprise Markets up 18% for the quarter.\nOrganic sales in the U.S. grew 6%, up 24% on a 3-year stack. European Focus Markets were up 3%. Excluding Russia, Europe Focus Markets were up 7%. Greater China organic sales were down 11%, mainly due to COVID-driven lockdowns in major regions of the market. Since lockdowns have eased, we've seen sequential market recovery but somewhat slower than expected when we gave guidance last quarter.\nIn Enterprise Markets, each of the 3 regions grew organic sales 14% or more. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 29 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.21, up 7% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 12%.\nCore operating margin decreased 30 basis points as gross margin pressure were largely offset by sales leverage and productivity improvements in SG&A. Currency-neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Free cash flow productivity was 99%. We returned $3.5 billion of cash to shareowners this quarter, nearly $2.3 billion in dividends and nearly [$1.3 billion] in share repurchase.\nIn summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year: organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Strong performance in very difficult operating conditions.\nNow I'll pass it over to Jon.\n\nJon R. Moeller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Board, The Procter & Gamble Company\n\nThanks, Andre. P&G employees have delivered great results over the past 4 years in a very challenging macro environment against very capable competition. In those 4 years, P&G people have added more than $13 billion in annual sales and roughly $5 billion in after-tax profit, executing our integrated strategies with excellence. I want to publicly thank our colleagues in product supply and R&D, who have enabled this progress with formulation, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics agility and extraordinary commitment to serve consumers, customers and each other through walk-downs, inbound supply shortages, outbound truck shortages, port blockages, natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. What P&G's people have accomplished together is truly extraordinary.\nStill, we're very clear-eyed about the trials ahead. The list of challenges we face heading into our new fiscal year is longer than any I can recall. The progress we've made and our collective commitment to our strategies give me confidence we can manage through these challenges. We've never been better positioned. A portfolio that's focused on daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, in-store execution and value; leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them; creating business versus taking business, powerful with our retail partners as we work to jointly create value.\nWe've developed a productivity muscle that helps address some of the challenges we face. We remain fully committed to cost and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet in each business and corporately. Productivity improvement is a necessity to drive balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation.\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry and in this dynamic and challenging environment requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important.\nOur organization structure is yielding what we intended: a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other. This improved agility and accountability have been important enablers of our strong results in the dynamic environment we faced.\nGoing forward, there are 4 areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of the strategy. The first is supply, improved capacity, agility, cost efficiency and resilience for a new reality and a new age. The capability investments we made prior to COVID to improve our manufacturing and distribution networks have helped us to manage through the last few years with relatively few prolonged issues. We're already making the next round of investments needed to ensure we have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs, sufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing demand and flexibility to meet the changing needs of all types of retailers.\nThe second area is environmental sustainability, integrated into our product packaging and supply chain innovation work, irresistibly superior offerings that are sustainable. New cardboard packaging on Gillette razors is an improvement for the environment and a noticeably superior experience for consumers at the first and second moments of truth. New fully recyclable paper packaging on our premium Always cotton protection pads recently launched in Germany. Laundry detergent formulations that deliver superior cleaning in cold water, reducing energy usage, saving money and extending garment lifespans for consumers.\nThird, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision-making. Increased digitization on manufacturing lines. More use of AI, more use of blockchain are not ends onto themselves. There are tools we can use to delight consumers and customers at the most reasonable cost possible.\nFourth, our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. By definition, this must include equality. To deliver a superior employee value equation, there must be something in it for everyone.\nThese are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority and reducing cost to enable investment to value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead.\nThe operational costs and currency challenges we faced over the last 2 years will continue in fiscal '23. We began the new fiscal year with consumers facing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years. We know one of the most pressing questions out there is how we plan to deal with the severe cost and currency impacts we're facing: $6.5 billion after tax in just 2 years, nearly an $8 billion hit to operating profit.\nI'll repeat what I said on our April 2020 earnings call: the best response to uncertainties and challenges we face is to double down on the integrated set of strategies that are delivering very strong results. It won't be easy, there will be bumps along the road, but we have the portfolio, superiority, productivity and in my not-so-humble opinion, the best organization in the world. We have everything we need. So again, I think we are very well positioned.\nWe're committed to keep investing to strengthen the superiority of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity to deliver superior value for consumers in every price tier in which we compete. Alongside our productivity work, we'll continue to offset a portion of the cost impacts with price increases. Whenever possible, we'll close a couple of those price increases with innovation. Those moves will be tailored to the market, category and brand.\nAs consumers face increased pressure on nearly every aspect of their household budgets, we invest to deliver truly superior value in combination of price and product performance to earn their loyalty every day. So far, elasticities in most categories where we've taken price increases have been better than our historical experience.\nOur strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, and the 4 focus areas that I mentioned strengthen the execution of that strategy. When all of this is executed well, we grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These integrated strategies are a pathway to delivering a balanced growth.\nWe've been talking about the importance of balance for a long time in the context of needing both top line and bottom line growth to deliver value for shareowners. We're in a world that needs more from us now. We need to expand that concept to serve and delight consumers, customers, employees, society and our shareowners. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do any of those, we will fail to do all of them.\nOur consumers increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. Our world requires that we do our part in this regard. This challenge is also a wonderful opportunity to extend our margin of superiority, further grow our categories and create more value, all while positively impacting the environment and society. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move forward.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2023.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, The Procter & Gamble Company\n\nThank you, Jon. As we've said in each guidance outlook for the past 2 years, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead. This rings true again as we enter fiscal 2023.\nThe combined year-on-year profit headwinds from foreign exchange rates, freight costs, materials, fuel, energy and wage inflation are an even greater challenge in fiscal '23 than they were in fiscal '22. Based on current spot prices and supply contracts, we estimate commodities, raw materials and packaging material costs to be a $2.1 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023.\nFreight costs are expected to be higher in fiscal '23 compared to the average cost paid in fiscal '22 by roughly $300 million after tax. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us even since our presentation at the Deutsche Bank conference in June. We now expect foreign exchange to be a $900 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined, headwinds from these items are now estimated at $3.3 billion after tax, roughly equal to the challenge we faced in fiscal '22, a 23 percentage point headwind to EPS growth or roughly $1.33 per share as we start the year.\nAs Jon said in his review of our strategies, we're working to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds through a combination of innovation to create and extend the superiority of our brands, productivity in all aspects of our work, and pricing. With this context, I'll move to the key guidance metrics.\nWe expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 3% to 4% with strong price contribution, offset by modest decreases in unit volume. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow at or above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal '23.\nOn the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus fiscal '22 EPS of $5.81. This guidance equates to a range of $5.81 to $6.05 per share, $5.93 or up 2% at the center of the range. Considering a 6-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 6% to 10% EPS growth on a constant currency basis.\nThere are many possible scenarios that could cause us to be outside of this range to either side, high or low. While it's relatively easy to envision many possible scenarios, steeper inflation, deep recession, further geopolitical disruption or commodity cost reversion, easing inflation, peaceful conflict resolution, it's very difficult to assign probability to any single scenario. As a result, we set the range we feel is most probable based on market conditions as we see them today.\nWe expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes a step-up in capital spending as we begin to add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock. Combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.\nNow I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts.\n\nJon R. Moeller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Board, The Procter & Gamble Company\n\nThe macroeconomic and market-level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results.\nWe'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

Today's event is being recorded for replay.\nThis discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.\nAs required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\n\nAndre Schulten\n\nCFO, The Procter & Gamble Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We will keep prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. This was another strong quarter, strong top line growth across categories and regions, sequential earnings growth progress in the face of significant and still increasing cost headwinds.\nStarting with a few highlights on the March quarter. Organic sales grew 10%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth. Pricing added 5 points as additional price increases began to reach the market. Mix added 2 points to sales growth for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength.\nEach of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew more than 30%. Fabric Care was up low teens. Baby Care and Feminine Care grew double digits. Oral Care and Grooming up high singles. Home Care and Family Care up mid-single digits. Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low singles. Focus markets grew 9%, and enterprise markets were up 12%.\nIn focus markets, U.S. organic sales were up 11% on 7% growth in the base period. On a 2-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales up 18%. Focus markets in Europe were up 10% and Asia Pacific, up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down mid-single digits versus a comp period that was up 22%.\nMarket conditions continued to soften in the March quarter due to COVID-driven lockdowns. In enterprise markets, Europe grew 18%; Latin America, up 16%; and Asia Middle East Africa grew 8%. Broad-based growth across geographies with 6 of 7 regions growing organic sales high singles or better.\nGlobal aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G.\nAll channel market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew nearly 9% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow, up 1 point versus same quarter last year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. 9 out of 10 product categories grew share over the past 3-, 6- and 12-month period in the U.S. and globally.\nConsumers continue to prefer P&G brands, recognizing the superior performance and value. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.33, up 6% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 10%. Within the EPS results, we estimate Ukraine, Russia was a negative impact of about $0.01 per share.\nCore gross margin decreased 400 basis points, and currency neutral core gross margin was down 380 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 490 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 130 basis point headwind, mainly from product form and pack size mix impact.\nPricing and productivity savings of 260 basis points partially offset the gross margin headwinds. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 380 basis points due to strong top line leverage. Advertising investments remain strong as we continue to communicate the superiority and value of P&G offerings across price tiers.\nCore operating margin decreased 10 basis points. Currency neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Productivity improvements were 170 basis points helped to this quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 74% as receivables and inventories increased due to strong sales results. We returned $3.4 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners, many of whom rely on the steady, reliable income earned with their P&G investment. This is the 65th consecutive annual dividend increase and 132nd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend.\nSo 3 quarters into the fiscal, organic sales up nearly 7% on broad-based growth across categories and geographies, solid global value share growth, sequentially improving EPS growth, strong cash productivity and an increased income commitment to owners of P&G shares.\nMoving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down on our efforts to delight consumers.\nThe strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation; a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.\nSuperior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. This drives value creation for our retail partners and build market share for P&G brands. Noticeable superiority is perhaps the most important inflationary environment we are now facing -- is most important in the inflationary environment we are potentially facing.\nA great example is the formula innovation we've launched on Tide and Ariel laundry detergents to enable superior cleaning performance in cold water washing. We're strengthening the communication of the cost benefits to consumers and the environmental benefits for the planet on the package and in our advertising.\nFor consumers, the savings from switching from hot to cold washing can nearly offset the cost of Tide or Ariel liquid detergent in each load. The superior cold water performance is a strong competitive advantage, enables immediate energy cost savings for our consumers and avoids the cost of rewashing, which may be necessary with less effective detergents. In addition, washing with cold water improves sustainability by reducing the energy required to heat water in the process and by improving garment lifespans.\nSuperior innovation delivering multiple benefits and improved value for consumers even while we price to offset a portion of the cost increases we are absorbing. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chain and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world.\nBuilding on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases. We closed a couple of price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way.\nThe strategic need for investments to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity.\nWe are committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation.\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important.\nOur organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are 4 areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of our strategies. Leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce costs and enable rapid and efficient decision-making, next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapted to a new reality. And our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicity, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and to develop the best talent.\nThese are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority in reducing cost to enable investment and value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead.\nThese strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit.\nThese strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move forward.\nMoving on to guidance. We said each quarter that we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. We've seen another step in cost pressures, and foreign exchange rates have moved further against us.\nTransportation and labor markets remain tight. Availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and markets. Inflationary cost pressures are broad-based and continue to increase with little sign of near-term relief and have resulted in consumer price increases across CPG categories and beyond.\nThe recent spike in virus cases in China and resulting lockdowns are affecting consumption and have caused temporary work stoppages in our operations and those of our suppliers. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to their impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on execution excellence have positioned us well to manage through these challenges over time.\nBased on the current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.5 million after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Since our last update, we've seen continued cost increases in nearly every type of material we use and in diesel and in natural gas. Freight costs have continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be a $400 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22.\nForeign exchange rate has also moved further against us since our last guidance. We now expect FX to be a $300 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We are offsetting a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings.\nIn the start of the fiscal year, we've taken price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the U.S. You may recall, it was 1 year ago when we announced price increases in the Feminine Care and Baby Care categories. Over the last year, input costs have continued to increase substantially. And as a result, the Feminine Care business has announced an additional price increase in the U.S., which will be effective in mid-July.\nAlso as a result of these increased cost headwinds, we recently announced price increases on certain items in the U.S. Home Care category that will be effective at the end of June and in the U.S. Oral Care business that will be effective mid-July.\nAs always, each category in each market is continually assessing the cost impacts they face and the potential need for pricing. If there are decisions to price, the degree and timing of those moves will be very specific to the category, the brand and sometimes to the individual SKU. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach.\nAlso, just as we've done over the past year, we'll look to close a couple of price increases with new innovation that offers our consumers more value, continue to drive category growth and maintain our competitive superiority advantage. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis.\nMoving to key guidance metrics. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 6% to 7% for the fiscal year, a 2-point increase versus our prior guidance of 4% to 5%. Pricing was a sequentially stronger contributor to top line growth in the third quarter and will continue to be a driver again in the fourth quarter as we get the full effect of increases taken over the past few months.\nWe are closely monitoring consumption trends for signs of changes. So far, elasticities have been in line or better than our expectations. Demand for our best-performing, premium-priced offerings remain strong as do our market share trends.\nOn the bottom line, we're maintaining the core earnings per share growth range of 3% to 6%. But given cost challenges we're facing, we now expect to be at the low end of the range at 3%.\nWithin this guidance, we expect an additional $0.04 per share of negative impact in the fourth quarter from higher costs and limited operations in Ukraine and Russia. The impact from commodities, freight and foreign exchange has increased significantly since the start of the fiscal year. Our initial guidance in July assumed $1.8 billion after tax or about $0.70 a share. This increased to $2.3 billion in our October outlook, $2.8 billion in January, now a $3.2 billion after-tax headwind to fiscal '22 earnings.\nOn an EPS basis, the headwinds are now approximately $1.26 a share or a 22% headwind to core EPS. So in the face of an incremental $0.56 per share of negative cost impact since the start of the year, we've held our going-in EPS range, and we've maintained strong investment superiority with new product innovation and fully funded advertising programs.\nOf note, the majority of the recent $400 million increase in cost and foreign exchange headwinds will impact us in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95% for the year. We continue to expect to pay $8 billion in dividends and now expect to repurchase approximately $10 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year.\nThis outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions and store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges.\nTo conclude, our business continues to exhibit strong momentum. And we believe P&G is well positioned to grow through and beyond the immediate issues we are facing. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and market volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times.\nWe'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions.\nQ2 was a strong quarter, very strong top line growth, sequential earnings progress in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong cash productivity. Our progress enables us to confirm fiscal year EPS guidance while increasing our estimates for top line growth, cash productivity and cash return to shareowners.\nOrganic sales grew more than 6%, volume contributed 3 points of sales growth, pricing added 3 points as September, October price increases flow through and as year-on-year promotion comparisons normalize. Mix was neutral for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew or held organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew 20%; fabric Care and Feminine Care were up double digits; baby Care, up high singles; Grooming, grew mid-singles. Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low single digits. Family Care organic sales were in line with prior year.\nFocus markets grew 6% and enterprise markets were up 7%. In focus markets, U.S. organic sales were up 9% despite 12% growth in the base period. On a 2-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 21%.\nEurope-focused markets were up 5%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year against a strong 12% base period comp and due to slower market growth in the quarter. In addition, we took proactive steps in the quarter to encourage our network of distributors to reduce inventory levels to reflect short-term consumer demand softness in the market.\nLatin America led the growth in enterprise markets, up 15%. Global aggregate market share increased 60 basis points. 38 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew nearly 3.5% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow, up nearly 1.5 points versus same quarter last year, now at 34%.\nImportantly, the share growth is broad-based. 9 of 10 product categories grew share over the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods in the U.S.\nConsumers continue to prefer P&G brands and superior performance they provide even as inflation is impacting household budgets. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.66, up 1% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 2%. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points, and currency-neutral core gross margin was down 410 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 460 basis points hit to gross margins. Mix was a 140 basis point headwind, mainly from product mix impacts. Productivity savings and pricing each provided partial offsets to the gross margin headwinds.\nWithin SG&A, advertising spending increased versus prior year as we continue to invest to communicate the superiority of our brands. However, overall marketing expense as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points driven by sales leverage and savings in nonworking marketing costs. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin declined 240 basis points. Productivity improvements were 150 basis points help to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 106%.\nWe returned nearly $7 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $4.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, while input costs and supply chains remain challenging, we delivered good results for the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, keeping us on track to deliver our going-in earnings estimates and to raise estimates for sales, cash productivity and cash return to share owners, which I'll come back to later.\nMoving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stays focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the 3 priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices.\nFirst is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs; third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.\nSuperior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth in our categories. This drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. The superiority model works in each of our categories. Take the 3 category growth drivers this quarter: Personal Health Care, Fabric Care and Feminine Care. Very different categories, different competitors, different geographic footprints and different materials and manufacturing processes, each delivering superiority and each growing organic sales double digits. In each of these categories, P&G is driving disproportionate share of overall category value growth, growing the pie for all participants.\nWe've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chain and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world.\nBuilding on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases. We closed copper price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation.\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices of portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which, in turn, grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during these volatile times, and we're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move through and beyond the crisis.\nMoving on to guidance. We said last quarter that we would undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. The Omicron variant has certainly proven this to be correct. As we saw in the first half of the fiscal year, growth results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects, along with these realities of current year cost pressures, foreign exchange volatility and continued effects of the global pandemic on supply chains and consumer behavior.\nTransportation and labor markets remain tight. Availability of materials remain stretched. In some categories and in some markets, inflationary pressures are broad-based with little sign of near-term relief. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time.\nThe recent spike in virus cases and resulting lockdowns increased the risk of additional work stoppages in our operations or in those of our suppliers. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Since our last update, we've seen continued increases in diesel and chemicals, with little offset in other materials.\nTrade costs have continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $300 million after-tax headwind for fiscal '22. Foreign exchange rates have also moved against us since our last guidance. We now expect FX to be a $200 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We will offset a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings.\nWe've now announced price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the U.S. Increases in Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, Hair Care, Grooming, Oral Care, Skin Care are now effective in market. We also increased prices on mid-tier liquid detergents and powder detergents over the last few months.\nIn mid-December, we announced to retailers that effective February 28, we are increasing pricing on the balance of our Fabric Care portfolio. This includes Tide, Gain, Downy, Bounce [and unstoppables] and includes all forms, liquid and unit dose detergents, sand beats, liquid fabric softness and dryer sheets.\nJust yesterday, we announced to retailers that we are increasing pricing on certain personal health care brands in the U.S. effective mid-April. The degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity, freight and foreign exchange impacts. As we've said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis.\nMoving to the key metric guidance. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year, up from our initial range of 2% to 4%. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reaches store shelves, we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. So far, we haven't seen noticeable changes in consumer behavior. Demand for our best-performing premium-priced offerings remains very strong as to our market share trends.\nOn the bottom line, we're confirming our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of 3% to 6%.\nIn total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight and foreign exchange is now a $2.8 billion after-tax headwind for fiscal '22 earnings or roughly $1.10 per share, a 20 percentage point headwind to core EPS growth. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands as pricing goes into effect. And as we annualize the initial spike in input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal.\nWe are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity to 95%, and we are raising our guidance for cash return to shareowners. We continue to expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends, and we now plan to repurchase $9 billion to $10 billion of common stock; combined a plan to return $17 billion to $18 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity price and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges.\nTo conclude, our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

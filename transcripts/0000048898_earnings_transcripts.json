Welcome to the Third Quarter 2025 Hubbell Inc. Earnings Conference Call.[Operator Instructions] Please be advised conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter. The press release and slides are posted on the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company. These are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference on this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures, which are included in the press release and slides. Now let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's Third quarter 2025 results. Hubbell delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth in the third quarter driven by strong high single-digit organic growth in Electrical Solutions and grid infrastructure as well as a lower year-on-year tax rate. In Utility Solutions, T&D markets remain strong as utility customers invest to interconnect new sources of load and generation on the grid, while aging infrastructure continues to drive solid hardening and resiliency activity. Our grid infrastructure businesses achieved high single-digit organic growth in the quarter. While the pace of inflection in grid infrastructure growth was steadier than we anticipated in our July outlook, markets and order activities are strong, and we anticipate further improvement in year-over-year organic growth in the fourth quarter. While Grid automation sales declined 18% in the third quarter on large project roll-offs, we anticipate these headwinds to fade in the fourth quarter as the business returns to more normalized comparisons.\nIn Electrical Solutions, we delivered high single-digit organic growth with continued margin expansion and double-digit adjusted operating profit growth. Our segment unification efforts and strategy to compete collectively are driving outgrowth in key vertical markets, most notably in data center, where new product introduction and capacity additions contributed to strong performance in the third quarter, with visibility to continued strength in the fourth quarter. We continue to simplify our HES segment to drive productivity and operating efficiencies, which we are confident will drive long-term margin expansion. Turning back to overall Hubbell. While cost inflation accelerated from the first half as anticipated, our pricing and productivity actions have been successful in more than offsetting these costs. Our strong positions in attractive markets and our execution in proactively managing our cost structure drove positive price/cost productivity in the third quarter and positions us well to drive continued profitable growth going forward. We are raising our full year 2025 outlook this morning.\nOperationally, we anticipate the impact of lower organic growth to be fully offset by stronger margin performance. while a lower full year tax rate drives higher adjusted earnings per share relative to our prior outlook. As we look ahead to 2026, we anticipate a year of strong broad-based organic growth across the portfolio. Hubbell is uniquely positioned at the intersection of grid modernization and electrification, and we have driven strong performance over the last 5 years. As these megatrends accelerate, and we exit 2025 with recent supply chain normalization dynamics behind us, we are confident in our ability to deliver continued strong performance in 2016 and beyond.\nNow turning to Slide 5. We announced at the beginning of October, the closing of our acquisition of DMC Power. We are very excited to add DMC to Hubbell's portfolio as the business is highly complementary to our utility connector product offerings and provides a unique technical solution in high-growth substation markets. Hubbell has been very successful in our acquisition playbook in utilizing our industry-leading sales force and portfolio, brand, to drive penetration of new solutions across our customer base and we are confident that we can accelerate DMC's strong growth trajectory further over the long term. This acquisition is a continuation of our capital allocation strategy to acquire high-growth high-margin businesses in attractive markets with strong strategic fit and product differentiation. We anticipate the acquisition of DMC will contribute approximately $0.20 of adjusted earnings per share accretion in 2026.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bill, I want to highlight our recent announcement of Bill's upcoming retirement as CFO at the end of this year. Bill's contributions to Hubbell have been immeasurable over his 18-year career with the company, but let me highlight a few statistics that put his impact into perspective. He led 68 quarterly earnings call, including more than 50 as CFO. He led the acquisition of 50 companies averaging a double-digit ROIC for our shareholders and most prominently, under Bill's tenure, Hubbell has more than doubled sales, improved OP margins from low teens to over 20% and increased our market cap from less than $3 billion to $23 billion. In short, Bill's strategic and financial leadership have helped shape Hubbell in the company it is today. He is valued and respected by employees, customers and shareholders alike. And on a more personal note, Bill has been a trusted partner to me and our entire leadership team. Thank you for your distinguished service to Hubbell, Bill, and we wish you all the best in a well-earned retirement.\nOne of Bill's many strength was developing a strong bench of finance under Hubbell, and I'm pleased to have announced Joe Capozzoli as Bill's successor. Joe has held a wide range of leadership positions across Hubbell, and the finance organization over his 12 years and most recently has been the CFO of our Electrical Solutions segment where he has worked as a close business partner to our segment President, Mark Mikes, in implementing our strategy to transform HGS as a unified operating segment. You can see the success of Joe's leadership in that role to the strong growth and margin expansion of ATS over the last few years. Joe and I have worked closely together over our careers and I am confident in a seamless transition and in Joe's ability to drive further value for all of our key stakeholders in his new role as CFO starting in 2026. With that, let me turn the call over to Bill to provide some additional details on our financial results.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everybody. Thanks for joining, and thank you, Gerben, for those remarks especially appreciative of the partnership you've offered me over my 18 years. And I think particularly the past 5 have been really special to me and Joe, I congratulate. I recruited him about 15 years ago, worked super closely with him. We've given him a variety of roles, as Gerben has noted, in corporate, in the field, inside of finance, operations and shared services. And I think you're going to find these really well prepared to be our CFO. And I think will be a great partner to Gerben, and I'm sure a great communicator to our shareholders.\nSo I'm going to use the slides that you found. I'm starting on Page 5, the third quarter results. You see sales up 4% to about $1.5 billion, OP similarly up 4% to $358 million. Adjusted diluted EPS up 12% and free cash flow up 34%. Let's go through each of those measures individually. So starting with sales, those results show really strong performance across the entire Electrical segment and the grid infrastructure unit within our utility segment. Those 2 areas, electrical and grid infrastructure grew collectively at around high single digits, where the grid automation component of utilities segment contracted and created about a 4% drag to the overall growth. What's important about that, as we look forward, we can see that the year-over-year compare for grid automation will start to flatten and that drag of 3 or 4 points will start to ebb away, as Gerben said, fade.\nSo the combination of growth in the Electrical segment growth in grid infrastructure plus the flattening of good automation is good driver of Q4 and ultimately a good setup for 2026. The second column there is operating profit, 4% growth to $358 million margins roughly comparable with effective price pulling offsetting combination of tariffs and a higher level of restructuring spending, which we feel it's really important to continue to drive productivity and to keep pushing margins up into the future. The earnings per share in the third to up 12% more than the growth rate in operating profit, and that's driven by tailwinds below the OP line. Specifically, we had share repurchases in the first half of the year totaling about $225 million that's helping lift EPS. And we had a lower tax rate as there was an international acquisition that gave us the opportunity for a tax-friendly restructuring and helped us drive the rate down. So helping push EPS up. And the fourth is free cash flow up 34%, $254 million, most importantly, in line to deliver our 90% of net income to the full year which continues to replenish the balance sheet.\nSo Gerben commented on the DMC acquisition. And even after that, $825 million investment, our balance sheet is still poised for investment. And so very good to see us be able to absorb an acquisition of that size and just take that in stride. So now let's unpack the performance by segment. And on Page 6, we'll start with the Utility segment results. Sales up 1% to $944 million. OP roughly comparable in dollars to $242 million. Back to sales, you see the grid infrastructure unit which accounts for about 3/4 of the segment grew high single digits. And I think the good news about that strength is that it was broad across all of the end markets. So Transmission was double digit, seeing strength driven by low growth and grid interconnections. Substation was up mid- to high single digit distribution up double digit with grid hardening and resiliency initiatives, and that's a good sign. That's representing acceleration as we move past a period of inventory normalization and distribution area.\nAnd lastly, Telecom and Enclosures returned to growth in the third quarter. I think you'll remember that had been dragging on us through an overstock situation there. So third quarter experiencing good breadth of sales strength in utility grade infrastructure. I think as we look to the fourth quarter in that area, we've got very good visibility to stronger growth rates in the fourth quarter. That's really being driven by the order book, which has really accelerated over the past 2 months in September and October, really releasing some pent-up spending and I think is a good sign for 4Q and beyond. Grid automation, continuing the trend from the last several quarters, down double digits driven by project roll-offs that aren't being backfilled with new projects, and that's being partially offset by growth in grid protection and control products. I think what's important here about the grid automation is we're really coming up to the point where we've had 4 quarters in a row now sequentially bouncing around between about $230 million to $240 million of quarterly sales. And so that started in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nSo as we get to the fourth quarter of 2025, we're going to start to see that sequential flatness turn into year-over-year flatness and really remove the drag on the segment that we've been experiencing. So good news there, just around the corner. On the OP side, dollars roughly comparable. Pricing and cost management created a nice tailwind, but offset largely with higher levels of restructuring spend and decrementals from the grid automation side.\nPage 7, let's switch to the Electrical segment. And you'll see Electrical segment continuing a string of strong performance here over the last several quarters. So you see double-digit sales growth of 10% and 17% OP growth with about 140 basis points of margin expansion. Returning to those sales, you'll see 8% organic fundamentally across the end markets, that lift is coming from 2 of those markets. One is data centers where we're selling connectors and grounding balance of system products as well as modular power distribution skin solutions, very strong growth there. Also very strong growth from the Light Industrial segment where you see connectors being sold into industrial applications, providing the lift there. That's where our R&D brand is continuing through the markets heavy industrial, a little bit mixed in the quarter and nonres remaining soft as it has been for the past few quarters. So basically by market there, you see about 8% growth. But beyond market growth, we feel good that we're pushing for both organic and inorganic growth here.\nSo we've effectively realigned the sales force. We have a more geographic bent now, which creates some efficiency, and we're complementing that with some vertical market specialists which creates some effectiveness, and we're very happy about how that's working for us. New product development, which Gerben had mentioned, we continue to expand the franchise organically through those measures. And on the inorganic side, we've been successfully operating an acquisition since the first quarter of '25, inventive provide solutions that power protect and connect wireless network. So Electrical really doing both organic and inorganic measures here. On the OP side, the 140 basis point of margin expansion coming through volume growth, price cost management and productivity initiatives to drive efficiency, as Gerben described, both Joe and Mark Mike and their team putting in initiatives to compete collectively as a segment. So really nice job turned in by Electrical Solutions segment, continuing multiyear story there, driving margins up.\nLet's pivot from describing the third quarter and so looking forward on Page 8. And you'll see that we've adjusted our EPS guidance upward for the year as well as narrowing the range. So we had a $0.50 range from $17.65 to 1815. We now have a $0.20 range from $18.10 to $18.30. That's a midpoint movement from $17.90 to $18.20 or a $0.30 increase, and we're essentially passing through lower expected tax rate for 2025. And that really implies that operationally for us, the third quarter was in line with what we needed to hit the full year target. We're getting there with a little more weight to electrical versus utility, and we're getting there with a little bit more weight to margin and sales versus what we had originally expected. But this outlook now can be summarized in that 3% to 4% organic growth, OP margins expanding in the 50 to 100 basis point range, good pricing, good productivity initiatives. The DMC acquisition, which Gerben highlighted, we're anticipating being neutral to earnings in Q4 as we set it up to contribute $0.20 next year. And we've got the free cash flow driving towards 90% of adjusted income conversion.\nIt may be instructive to comment on and talk about the Q4 that's needed to deliver this full year guide. It's a little bit stronger than normal seasonality. And I just want to take a second to describe why we're confident to have the visibility in that. So the fourth quarter would imply 8% to 10% organic growth with contributions from both segments. And if you think about the step-up in growth, if we walk sequentially, you can see -- we talked about the absence of the grid automation headwinds that adds substantially. We've got incremental price in the fourth quarter, and we see strong visibility to data center projects new capacity inside of our Burndy business from some investments we've made in automation there and very substantial pickup in September and October in the transmission and distribution orders of utility segment. So we see that we've got visibility to that, and we're going to see margin expansion in both segments in the quarter. And so that's leading to our ability to maintain that original guide with the pass-through of the taxes creating a $0.30 increase.\nSo with that, I'll pass it back to Gerben and ask him to pull back the lens from this quarterly focus to a longer-term view of our utility franchise.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nOkay, great. Before we give our preliminary thoughts on 2026, we thought it would be instructive to set the stage by taking a closer look at the performance of our utility segment over the last 5 years and how that sets us up looking ahead to 2026 and over the next several years, and this is on Page 9. While there is a lot of information on the page, let me highlight a few key points. First, while supply chain dynamics have impacted the various pockets of our segment over the last few years, we have executed well through these dynamics, and they will be fully normalized exiting 2025. Second, the strong growth and margin expansion we have delivered has been driven by our large, high growth and margin businesses. Most notably, T&D infrastructure has grown a double-digit CAGR over the last 5 years underpinned by our strong portfolio, position and secular megatrends and proactive price cost management.\nWhile our meters and AMI performance has been more modest we are confident that we have repositioned this business with the appropriate cost structure and a more focused strategy to deliver growth at improving margin levels moving forward. Third, our M&A and capital allocation strategy has been effective in driving outgrowth while expanding our leading utility positions. Most notably, in substation automation with the acquisition of Systems Control, as well as the attractive area of grid protection and control. And finally, as we look back at the last several years of performance as a whole, HUS has delivered organic growth in line with strong utility CapEx budgets, which are set to accelerate further over the next several years as customers increase their investment budget to meet the demands of grid hardening, load growth and data center interconnections. We are confident that our strong position in these attractive markets will enable our Utility Solutions segment to meet or exceed our long-term targets for mid-single-digit organic growth moving forward.\nNow turning to Page 10. I'd like to provide some preliminary views on our end markets for the next year before providing a more comprehensive full year outlook in the next few months. In Utility Solutions, we have high visibility to a robust project pipeline supporting continued strength in substation and transmission markets. While ongoing hardening and resiliency activity support continued momentum in distribution markets and modernization initiatives support strong growth in grid protection and controls. In our smaller end markets, we anticipate a return to growth in meters and AMI as well as telecom. In Electrical Solutions, we expect data center, light industrial and T&D markets to remain strong. While macroeconomic uncertainty drives a more modest preliminary growth outlook in areas of the portfolio such as nonresidential construction, heavy industrial and renewables. We are confident that our strategy to compete collectively in HES will continue to drive above-market growth and long-term margin expansion.\nOverall, we see an attractive end market environment which we believe will enable us to deliver organic growth in line with our long-term targets, and we are confident that accelerating mega trends impacting the largest high-margin areas of our portfolio will underpin strong performance in 2026 and beyond. With that, let me turn the call over to Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Innamorato. You may begin. .\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter of 2025. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. Joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company. These are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nPlease note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference to this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures, which are included in the press release and slides. Now let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Dan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's Second Quarter 2025 Results. Hubbell delivered double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter, driven by strong organic growth in grid infrastructure and Electrical Solutions as well as year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. We are raising our full year outlook today, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive financial performance for our shareholders over the near and long term.\nAs detailed in this morning's press release, our results and outlook this morning are presented on a FIFO basis. Bill will provide you with some additional details in a few minutes, but this transition enables a greater consistency of cost accounting method across our businesses and better matching of expense and revenue recognition, particularly during inflationary periods.\nWhile raw material inflation and tariffs are driving incremental cost inflation relative to our initial outlook, you will see throughout today's presentation that we have been proactive in driving price and productivity across our portfolio, and we are well positioned to achieve positive price/cost productivity in 2025. In Utility Solutions, performance in the quarter was highlighted by 7% organic growth in grid infrastructure.\nTransmission and substation markets remain strong as our utility customers invest to interconnect new sources of load and generation on the grid. And distribution markets returned to growth as the recent customer inventory normalization cycle has run its course and our sales growth in the quarter recoupled to reflect solid end market demand driven by grid hardening.\nGrid infrastructure orders remained strong, up high teens year-over-year in the first half and support our expectation for strong organic growth in the second half. While grid automation performance was weaker than anticipated, strong growth in our higher-margin T&D components product categories, drove favorable mix dynamics in the quarter. In Electrical Solutions, we delivered mid-single-digit organic growth with continued, adjusted operating margin expansion and 9% adjusted operating profit growth.\nOur segment unification efforts and our strategy to compete collectively are driving out growth in key vertical markets, most notably evidenced by strong data center growth in the second quarter. From an operational standpoint, we continue to simplify our business to drive productivity and operating efficiencies, which we are confident will drive long-term margin expansion. While the macroeconomic and inflationary environments remain dynamic, Hubbell is well positioned in attractive markets with a leading portfolio of brands, and we are proactively managing our cost structure and pricing actions to drive continued profitable growth.\nNow let me turn the call over to Bill to provide some more details on our financial results.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gerb, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And maybe before my comments, if I maybe just a personal note of support. Any of you who are in Midtown yesterday, rifle being discharged, [ that parked ] on 52nd Street is pretty disturbing day. And I just hope you and your people are all okay. .\nSo I'm going to start my comments on Page 4 of the slides that you hopefully have found and start with our adoption of a unified FIFO-based inventory accounting standard. Our previous state had been roughly, in very rough terms, half LIFO, half FIFO. That was really just an outcome of companies we had bought or companies we had sold. We just brought them on in there prior standards. And we thought this was a good time to make the effort to harmonize that with maybe 3 specific benefits.\nThe first being running the company under a single methodology, I think allows us to simplify our business reviews and have everybody running the same way. I think secondly, in an inflationary environment because of the fact that our pricing typically takes about a quarter to get into the revenue stream, we find this creates a better match of the timing of when new higher costs are recognized and when those new prices are recognized.\nSo previously, we created a distorting lag and asked you to be patient. And I think now we can offer you a more accurate recognition of our margin in the quarter that it's happening. And I think third, I'm hoping it puts us from your perspective on the same footing as our reporting peers, so hopefully make it easier for you all to make comparisons and contrast and better judgments.\nSo obviously, none of this destroys or creates profits during the cycle. It's just the timing of when the expenses are recognized. So the implications you can see on the right-hand side of the page was a $29 million decrease in COGS in the second quarter and a $20 million decrease in COGS for the first half. So you see, the impacts on first half of '25 was about $0.30, and that's equivalent to the range in guidance that we've made, and Gerben is going to talk about more at the end of the conversation.\nThe other implication is accelerate some tax payments to be made over the next several years. And interestingly, those payments will be more than offset by what we're expecting to be cash benefits from the new Big Beautiful Bill tax legislation that was recently passed in early July. So all of this, we just wanted to remind on the bottom of the page, we feel the obligation to continue to put out a high-quality reporting framework.\nWe think more harmonized standard continues to contribute to that. And we're just calling out here, reminding everybody that [ we do things ] like fully burden our segments with corporate costs. We include restructuring costs in our results because we feel they're an important part of our ongoing performance, and we as well recognize the benefit. So enough, hopefully, on a county.\nSo turning to the performance. I'm on Page 5. Our sales were up in the quarter, 2% to just under $1.5 billion. There was general strength in our Electrical segment. And in the utility side, the strength was on the grid infrastructure area. And in grid automation, we had a weak quarter of double-digit contraction.\nIf you put the Electrical segment and the Infrastructure side together, you'd have mid-single-digit growth rate in that grid automation piece, providing a couple of point drag to the overall sales results. Second column, you see adjusted operating profit. The dollar is up 8% in the quarter to $362 million. And the margins widened by 120 basis points to 24.4%.\nIf we talked about the drivers there, interestingly, we tend not to talk about mix very frequently with you all. But it so happens that the area of contraction in grid automation and Aclara is towards the lower end of the spectrum of our margin of our portfolio versus the areas of growth, namely [ Burndy in grounding ] and connectors and T&D area of utility happen to be quite high-margin areas. And so there is to just the market growth, just a natural mix benefit as well, continue to manage price/cost very well and as well the FIFO impact as we discussed on the previous page.\nThe third column there is adjusted earnings per share. You see grew on a dollar basis, 11% to $4.93, outgrowing the operating profit growth with some non-op tailwinds. Last year's tax rate was a little bit higher. And I think as we've been talking about with you all during the first half of the year, we bought some shares, about $225 million of share repurchases. So that creates a little bit of non-op lift as well. On the fourth column, you have the free cash flow, good growth in the quarter.\nAnd importantly, we feel continuing to track to the 90% conversion that we're targeting to achieve through the operating year of 2025. So let's disaggregate the enterprise results into the 2 segments.\nAnd on Page 6, we'll start with utility. And you see 1% growth there to $936 million, all of that growth being organic. That unpacks into the 2 pieces. One is the Grid Infrastructure, the more hardware side of the business, that's about 3/4 of the segment and you see 7% growth there and that disaggregates into double-digit growth in transmission and substation, continued very healthy demand there and the distribution side, that last mile connecting to the house or the building growing at a mid-single-digit rate of sales.\nImportant to note that year-to-date, our orders are up high teens in this area. And I mentioned that importantly, when Gerben gets to our guidance and our outlook for the balance of the year, certainly, that order book is influencing very heavily, how we think about providing you guys guidance here at the halfway point. So I think we continue to see the trends of grid modernization and electrification alive and well. Very good news.\nI think additional good news and quite noteworthy to see that as the distribution products grew, we can say that the channel destock has concluded. I'm sure you are as happy as I am to not have us discuss that any longer with you all. So that feels good to emerge from that. Grid automation at a 13% contraction, about 1/4 of the total segment. We've had some roll off of large projects that were not backfilled, and we really have a situation where we have been coming out of a heavy backlog year that was created when the chips weren't available the year prior to that.\nAnd so we've had some erratic comparisons to be made. And I think when we get to the outlook, I'll talk a little bit more about, I think, how grid automation feels to be in a stable and growing environment finally. On the operating profit side, on the right-hand side of the page, you see the dollars grow by 7% to $239 million in the quarter, margins up 140 basis points, driven by continued price realization, managing price/costs quite effectively. Again, good mix there between the Infrastructure growth and the Grid Automation contraction. So solid bottom line performance for that segment and good growth trends inside the core piece of Gride Infrastructure.\nWe'll talk about Electrical segment on Page 7. We see a solid quarter turned in by the segment. 4% sales growth to $545 million (sic) [ $549 million ], largely organic, but there was a small contribution from the Ventev acquisition, which you'll remember, which is wireless infrastructure products. As we think about driving that mid-single-digit growth data centers continues to be a very significant contributor to our balance of systems product portfolio that's exposed there.\nThe light industrial markets were very strong for us for our connectors and grounding products. Heavy industrial, certainly more mixed than nonres a little bit soft. As you look to the right side of the page, on the operating profit, 9% growth in dollars to $124 million, margins up 1 point to 22.5%, and they are dropping through incrementals on their volume, managing price costs and they continue to push productivity.\nSo I think you all remember Mike's leading this segment, doing a good job on competing collectively. On the [ top side ], working around some sales force realignments that we think have been successful in vertical market selling and cross-selling and continuing to work some channel conversions.\nAnd on the cost side, continuing to become more and more efficient as we create a real segment rather than a series of vertical businesses. What I think Mark's pulling off here and his team is consistent multiyear momentum in Electrical segment, and we see it continuing to grind upwards and improve. And we're very pleased with his results, and I think he's got still years to go on that improvement side.\nOn Page 8, I'm going to talk about the markets as a setup, and Gerben is going to come back and talk about our outlook and guidance and kind of have these market perspectives maybe as input into the top line of his guidance comments that he'll share. So what you see in the inside of both of the circles is roughly 4% to 6% organic sales growth. It's roughly equal between the segments, and it's roughly equal contributions from price and volume, though. A little bit price skewed versus volume skewed there.\nAnd so if we start with Electrical on the right, we think the second half will be quite similar to the first half. You'll see from around 10:00 to around 3:00 there in the circle, we're a little more cautious around heavy industrial and nonres contemplating flat contributions for the year. But as you work down, you start to see light industrial, renewables, you're seeing low and mid-single-digit contributions.\nClearly, the star of the show continues to be data centers, and we're anticipating a 30% growth there. The left side, you've got our utility markets and what you see from about 10 o'clock to 4 o'clock see the grid protection and the electrical distribution, high singles and mid singles. Again, I'll just note that electrical distribution of mid-singles. It maybe looks modest next to the transmission and substation, but that is an inflection just to remind us coming off of its destocking. And so that's quite quite good for us to see that rebounding the mid- and high-teens performance of substation and transmission markets we just see continued strength there.\nOur positioning is very good, and I think our sales growth is going to be strong. Telecom is worth mentioning as another inflection point. I think you all recall us going through last year with some significant contractions there in the enclosures business driven by telecoms and again, quite encouraging to see them finish out any of the overstocking situation plus potentially any market weakness that was combining with that to return to growth.\nSo that's quite good. You see Aclara piece of meters and AMI down 20%. And I think that's worth maybe some comments. Clearly, the large projects and a lot of the backlog that we were fulfilling from that point in time in the previous year, the chips that become unavailable, is difficult for us to ship. Those got fulfilled and created quite a difficult compare for last year. We've in response, managed costs, really working to moderate the decrementals there.\nAnd I think if I were to describe the position that Aclara is in, I would say the last 3 quarters have been quite flat sequentially. We think that's a -- we're kind of down to that stable base of smaller projects. MRO, good business with muni and co-ops and the more public utilities. And we think we're expecting that in the fourth quarter, Aclara will return to growth and be able to have a steadier operation moving forward as we sort of absorbed this reaction to that heavy backlog here and the prior year. So with those pieces, I'm going to turn it to Gerben and have him synthesize that into our outlook for you.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $17.65 to $18.15. This represents a raise of $0.30 at both the low and high end of our prior outlook range. We anticipate 4% to 6% organic growth and full year adjusted operating margin expansion to drive high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint of our range. This outlook is consistent with our long-term financial framework which we believe will deliver differentiated returns for our shareholders over time.\nWe are confident in our ability to navigate through near-term macroeconomic and inflationary uncertainties to deliver on these increased financial commitments in 2025. We are seeing strong evidence of secular growth megatrends in the largest, highest margin areas of our portfolio which we believe will underpin strong performance in the second half of 2025 and over the next several years. We are confident that Hubbell's unique leading positions at the intersection of grid modernization and electrification combined with structural opportunities in our operating model and capital deployment potential will continue to drive long-term shareholder value creation.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Hubbell Incorporated First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, you may begin.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2025. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company. These are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 [indiscernible] may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to full GAAP measures, which are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's first quarter 2025 results. Our results in the quarter were driven by continued strong operating performance in our Electrical Solutions segment and a return to organic growth in grid infrastructure, offset by anticipated softness in grid automation and the impact of increased cost inflation from higher raw material prices and tariffs. In Electrical Solutions, we delivered mid-single-digit organic growth with continued adjusted operating margin expansion and strong core adjusted operating profit growth. Our segment unification efforts and our strategy to complete compete collectively are driving out growth in key vertical markets, most notably evidenced by strong data center growth in first quarter.\nFrom an operational standpoint, we continue to simplify our business to drive productivity and operating efficiencies, which we are confident will drive long-term margin expansion.\nIn Utility Solutions, while good automation sales were down on challenging prior year comparisons as anticipated, our grid infrastructure business returned to organic growth in the quarter. Transmission and substation markets remain strong as utility customers invest to interconnect new sources of low -- generation on the grid.\nWe delivered another quarter of double-digit growth across these markets in the quarter as our leading positions and premium brands position us well to capitalize on a growing funnel of project opportunities. In distribution markets, we are encouraged by recent order trends and are confident that we are emerging from the recent period of customer inventory normalization.\nBefore I turn it over to Bill to discuss the results and our outlook in more detail, I'd like to provide some opening comments on how we are positioning Hubbell to mitigate recent cost inflation and near-term macroeconomic uncertainty. Hubbell is a U.S.-centric manufacturing company with more than 90% of our sales in the U.S. and a largely U.S.-based manufacturing footprint. Our international sales are served primarily on a local-for-local basis. While recent raw materials, inflation and tariffs implemented in February and March drove a headwind in the first quarter, we have already implemented action to offset those impacts within 2025, and we are taking the actions necessary to offset the more recent impact of reciprocal tariffs.\nCost inflation cycles are not new to Hubbell, we have successfully dealt with them before, and we have a playbook in place with several levers at our disposal to drive continued profitable growth under a range of scenarios. From a market standpoint, while the macroeconomic environment has become more dynamic over the last several months, we see no net change to our prior near-term and long-term views. We believe the current environment warrants caution and continued proactive cost management with strong recent order trends and favorable end markets can support our forward growth expectations. Additionally, our markets are not only bolstered by near and long-term growth megatrends, but it has also proven to be more resilient during periods of economic uncertainty. We are maintaining our full year 2025 outlook this morning and remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial and strategic commitments.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Gerben. Good morning, everybody. appreciate you taking time to be with us. We're quite aware. It's a busy morning. I'm going to start my comments on Page 4, and we'll be using the slides that you hopefully found. So the first quarter results for Hubbell were strong performance from the Electrical segment, strong performance from great infrastructure some headwinds from grid automation as they faced a very difficult prior year comparison. And I would say that first quarter performance sets itself up now for normal ramped-up seasonality and for us to deliver and support the full year target and expectations that we have.\nOn the cost side, we had some incremental headwinds from higher raw material prices and tariffs. We're going to talk about tariffs and more robustly in a little bit. we're lumping in raw material inflation just because we think about it as what we need to offset with price and productivity. And I think we're going to provide slightly unique challenge for you all in our LIFO-based income statement. We are recognizing these cost increases as they happen. The FIFO reporters will be a quarter or so down the road before they start recognizing those costs. So we're going to really be showing you a little bit of that gap but we've got, as Gerben highlighted actions to offset those and able to hold on to our initial targets.\nSo on Page 4 on the left, when you see sales of $1.365 billion. The decrease largely driven by the divestiture of residential lighting quite flat, otherwise, where the growth we experienced in the Electrical segment as well as in grid infrastructure was essentially offset by the decline in grid automation as they faced a tougher compare. We like to look at the sales sequentially as well, not just year-over-year and up 2% with strong orders, and we'll talk more about that as we look forward to the balance of the year. But really those -- the order book is supporting a strong seasonal ramp up.\nThe second column, you see operating profit and you see the OP down to $264 million margins down 40 basis points. That includes 1 point of positive price and then some headwind from the material costs creating about a $10 million drag of price and productivity against material inflation, tariffs and other inflation. Absent these $10 million drag, you would have seen margins expand nicely. And I make that comment just because we're going to be offsetting that drag in the second half of the year. So the durable margins underlying that would have been up, and we think that's a good sign.\nI'm going to now unpack performance by segment. And starting on Page 5, we'll start with Utility Solutions. You see the sales of $857 million down 4% from prior year. That's comprised of low single-digit growth on the infrastructure side and 15% contraction on grid automation. The infrastructure side accounts for about 3/4 of the segment and the markets are continuing in good shape in the transmission and substation side, double-digit growth by us. We feel very good about our strong positioning and differentiated solutions in fast-growing market here. That's being driven by grid modernization and electrification trends. And that's got nice momentum and has been growing strongly, expected to continue. Distribution was down in the quarter. But again, importantly, sales and orders up sequentially. As Gerben had mentioned, the customer and channel inventory normalization has really been a nagging headwind in 2024 for the grid infrastructure business unit. Particularly for distribution products and telecom portion of enclosures. We would say that by the sequential and orders, we would say that normalization period by the end of the quarter here, we've reached it, and the period of destocking is now behind us. We're happy to say. So we're looking forward to seeing kind of a book and build demand. The orders across all of grid infrastructure up double digits and up sequentially, and that's really a broad-based trend where we're seeing that in all 3 areas of transmission, substation, distribution and telecom.\nOn the grid automation side, you see that business being down teens and that mid-teens that compares to a prior year comp of up 30%. So certainly a tough compare. The sales are flattening sequentially from the fourth quarter, and we're seeing the large project roll-offs being backfilled by smaller projects and MRO activity. So I think we see grid automation now in kind of a steadier environment rather than being consistent downdraft. We think it's nice, steady based on these smaller projects and MRO. The margins in utility, you see $180 million of operating profit, a decline of 80 basis points of margin this is really where you see a lot of the price cost productivity headwind that we described. Our Utility segment has a higher mix of LIFO units than does our Electrical segment. And so we're seeing those costs hitting the P&L sooner here in the utility, which is dragging those margins down just a little bit.\nTalking about Electrical on Page 6. Another strong quarter for the Electrical segment. You see mid-single-digit growth when we net out the M&A impact of the divestiture of residential lighting. We have finally now lapped that so we won't have to continue to torture you by kind of manually pulling that out to make same-store sales comparisons for you. Strong margin expansion of 5% growth, 70 basis point improvement in margin Likewise, if you pulled the lighting results out of the prior year to make it comparable, you'd see something closer to double-digit growth. So a strong quarter for the segment.\nIf we look at the 5% sales growth, data centers was our largest contributor. We had double-digit growth in the balance of systems which are products like our connectors and grounding product, wiring devices and the like. Good momentum in that space, healthy growth. And our PCX business strong growth there as well. So big contribution from data centers to the segment. Ex data center results are slightly more mixed, where on the light industrial side, which is where our [ Birdy ] brand is. We saw strong growth. We're benefiting there from mega projects, think of large industrial factories like chip plants as well as a general trend of industrial reshoring, helping in light industrial. On the heavy side, a little bit more mixed performance where oil and gas was a good contributor on the nonres side, we saw some softness, which is consistent with the past few quarters.\nWe're pleased that we got good results from a vertical market strategy. That led to some contributions from new product development as well as some customer conversions as our newly aligned sales force is proving to be effective in the marketplace.\nOn the OP side, you see 70 basis points of margin expansion, 5% growth to $84 million of OP. And that's driven really by the volume growth, efficiency gains from our compete collectively initiatives and some price cost productivity headwinds less impactful the utility as they have a higher FIFO mix, but nonetheless, a drag from that in the Electrical segment.\nWe thought it would be helpful on Page 7. to break down the tariff exposure and to be clear that we're including in the tariff exposure, the inflationary pressure on raw materials that the tariffs are influenced even if they're not direct tariffs. And we're hoping that Page 7 helps shine the light here. So you see, as Gerben had mentioned, a U.S.-centric company, but with global supply chain, Mexico being about mid-teens of mix, China mid-single digits and the rest of the world less than 5. We've -- it most useful to separate the effects into 2 different buckets. And the first category on the left is really the effects in the first quarter from tariffs that were implemented in February and March, but also you see we're including higher raw material costs. So even if we're not paying tariff on student on aluminum, those commodities have experienced inflation. And the way we calculate this [ $135 million ] impact on 2025 from a cost perspective, about, half of that these just these raw material costs and the balance being tariffs.\nAnd we've got a set of initiatives that Gerben gave you a little insight to leading with price. We've been in communications with customers with letters. We have enacted those price increases. They're effective in mid-April, and we've now been taking orders at those new prices and the stick rate gives us confidence on this call, even though it's a little early to let you know that we will neutralize that $135 million impact within calendar year 2025.\nThe second column is the reciprocal tariffs that were enacted in April, we, too, will neutralize these effects using price and productivity levers. And those mitigation actions are underway. We've been in contact with our customers. Those price increases are not yet fully implemented. They're expected to go in later this month. And so we don't know about stick rates as well. And so while we're confident we'll offset and neutralize these -- it's not fully clear yet that, that will happen within calendar year '25, given the LIFO lag and the fact that we'll be recognizing these costs immediately. So to see when we get to the outlook page, we've given you a little bit of a sensitivity. We're targeting to get all of this offset and neutralized within calendar year. But it's possible it takes until the first quarter of next year, and we'll certainly keep you updated as those impacts become a little more clear.\nSo our outlook is on Page 8 and you see that we are maintaining our 2025 adjusted EPS outlook range. And that involves organic growth of 6% to 8%. We believe that the markets are intact. And so about half of that or 3% to 4%, we think is going to come from volume and the balance of 3% to 4% will be coming from price. And so that price -- those price actions, again, confident that we'll be offsetting that first phase of the first quarter tariffs and inflation on materials. And you can see that illustrated by the red and green bars offsetting each other, getting back to the original range. The second set of reciprocals. We're targeting neutral, but we wanted to highlight a $0.50 sensitivity just in case the LIFO accounting recognizes a little more cost before the price can hit, and we'll be able to update you certainly next quarter on how that's going.\nSo the guidance is intact. Free cash flow, you saw on the opening page, a little bit down quarter-over-quarter, but certainly in line to hit our target of 90% or greater of net income on the free cash flow. You'll see on the right some comments on modeling considerations that we can talk about as much of that in Q&A as you want. But essentially, we're anticipating a ramp, and that's going to allow us to get some growth -- good growth in the second quarter.\nWe wanted to end -- that's obviously, guidance is around $25 million. We wanted to end on Page 9 with some comments that maybe extend beyond '25 into '26 and beyond and I wanted to talk about the balance sheet, which we think is in great shape, it's very poised to support an active level of investment as well as returns to shareholders. You can see in the graph, we're depicting for the 3-year period of '25 to '27 about $3.5 billion of operating cash, burden that with CapEx gets to about $3 billion of free cash flow with dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases. We get to about $2 billion of cash generation, that excludes and ignores the borrowing capacity inherent in the balance sheet, which would more than double that number. And our bias is to deploy that into acquisitions. We think acquisitions give us the best way to improve the depth and breadth of our product positioning continues to deepen our importance to our customers, add critical technologies as well as provide very attractive rates of return on capital.\nBut we also have flexibility on the share repurchase side. And just to remind everybody, our authorization on that side had been increased earlier this year, order of magnitude of $600 million of availability. We did buy $125 million worth of shares in Q1. We believe at attractive valuations and certainly, the share repurchase lever is available to us as you can see the balance sheet and capital deployment here.\nI want to, Gerben, comment on the left-hand side, certainly, the T&D core business is critical both to us achieving our '25 guide, but also to success beyond that. So as you comment on that, please.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And before we turn the call over to Q&A, let me provide some more context on T&D brands as we are beginning to see evidence of acceleration in areas of the portfolio, which face customer inventory normalization throughout 2024. Grid infrastructure orders were up double digits year-over-year in the first quarter and up solidly versus the fourth quarter and order trends were strong across each of the end markets. More importantly, underlying end market dynamics are strong and forward outlook for major customers have recently increased. On average, over the past 6 months, multiyear capital plans from a representative group of our top investor-owned utility customers have revised upwards by approximately 10% from prior multiyear plans. As we have previously communicated, we believe T&D markets are at the early stages of a long-term investment cycle, underpinned by secular trends in grid modernization and electrification. We are confident that we are emerging from the recent period of customer inventory normalization with leading positions, solutions and service levels that will enable Hubbell to effectively capitalize on this visible long-term opportunity.\nAnd to conclude this morning's prepared remarks and turning my comments back to Olaf Hubbell, we are confident in our ability to execute through near-term uncertainties and deliver on our financial commitments in 2025. We are focused as a management team to drive the needed actions to navigate this dynamic environment, and we view it as our obligation to manage the short term. We have a demonstrated track record over the last several years of executing effectively through a wide range of macroeconomic and inflationary environments, and we will continue to do so moving forward. But we are also not losing sight of the long-term opportunities ahead of us, and we are increasingly confident that our utility and electrical customers will do significantly more business with Hubbell over the next several years. This confidence is underpinned by our unique leading positions in markets supported by visible megatrends as well as recent customer insights and order trends. We anticipate that our attractive long-term growth outlook, combined with structural opportunities in our operating model and capital deployment levels will continue to drive consistent shareholder value creation.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter 2024. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. Joined today our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. .\nPlease note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and consider it incorporated by reference on this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 results. Hubbell delivered strong double-digit growth in adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow in the quarter. While organic volumes were below our expectations, strong execution drove year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion of 240 basis points. On a full year basis, we achieved mid-single-digit sales growth, 9% adjusted operating profit growth, 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and double-digit growth in free cash flow.\n2024 adjusted earnings per share of $16.57 was above the high end of our initial guidance range as well as our latest outlook we provided in October. We achieved this strong full year performance despite having to navigate pockets of significant challenges in telco markets and utility customer destocking as we executed effectively throughout the year on 4 key levers within our control. The first of these levers is that we made significant progress in 2024 on our strategy to unify our Electrical Solutions segment. We generated above-market growth in attractive verticals with an integrated solutions-oriented service model for our customers, while at the same time, driving business simplification and operational efficiencies to expand margins.\nThese efforts resulted in double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in 2024 despite absorbing the impact of the residential lighting divestiture. Second, we effectively captured opportunities from secular growth trends across our utility and electrical markets, most notably driving double-digit growth in transmission and substation markets in front of the meter as well as renewables and data center balance of system solutions behind the meter. Third, we proactively managed price/cost productivity in 2024. Price realization remains favorable across both segments. We are delivering on accelerated productivity plans in our factories and supply chain, and we actively managed our cost structure and discretionary spending.\nAnd fourth, our strong balance sheet and differentiated capital deployment strategy contributed significantly to our success, primarily to the acquisition and successful integration of systems control. As we look ahead, we expect that the temporary headwinds we faced in 2024 will fade going forward, while each of the levers that we have driven our success in 2024 and prior years remain intact for '25 and beyond. We are introducing our full year 2025 outlook this morning, which anticipates mid-single-digit organic growth with continued margin expansion and attractive growth in operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow.\nThis outlook is consistent with our long-term financial framework and demonstrates Hubbell's confidence in our ability to continue compounding off of a strong multiyear base of performance. I will share more details on the outlook at the end of this call. But first, let me turn it over to Bill to provide you with some more details on our performance in the quarter.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gerb, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate you taking the time to be with us. I'm going to use the slides to guide my comments, and I'm starting on Page 4 of those materials. So this 4 blocker, you can see the strong performance of Hubbell turned in, in the fourth quarter. And you can see the business model in action, double-digit growth in operating profit, double-digit growth in earnings per share and 28% growth in free cash flow despite flattish sales.\nThose flat sales at $1.3 billion were below our expectations. It's not uncommon for year-end to have different forms of incentive-driven distortions. Specifically, there are some volume-driven rebates in the system as well as free cash flow driven bonus formulas and those kinds of incentives can lead decision makers to not want inventory and put their orders in to be shipped after December and in particular, in low-volume years. Those can be exacerbated a little bit.\nSo I think we experienced some of that in December. But independent of the organic -- on the inorganic side, a good contribution on sales from our net M&A efforts. So that includes exiting the residential lighting business, but adding systems control, which just to remind everybody provides turnkey solutions in the substation market and you saw a good contribution to sales inorganically there. The operational performance more than made up for that sales backdrop, in particular, some of the price/cost productivity levers were effectively pulled. We continue to get price in the quarter. So I think impressive after a couple of years of compounding here between '22 and '23 and now '24. And on the operational side, those portfolio transformation efforts really benefit the margins as well. So you saw 2.5 points, nearly 2.5 points of margin expansion.\nOn the EPS side, an increase of 11% to $4.10 in the quarter. That 11% growth rate is in line with operating profit. So the non-op items were neutral in the quarter. And the free cash flow, up 28%, I think, is noteworthy. It delivered for the full year above our target of $800 million, which is about a 90% conversion rate. And I think of note, this cash flow performance absorbs continued increases in our CapEx investments.\nThose investments continue to be really important for driving capacity in our high-growth areas and getting productivity out of the system. And that CapEx for us over the past 3 years has doubled. So that free cash flow is really helping finance that, and we think those projects are quite good and give us good returns. I think let's unpack the performance now by segment, and I'm going to start with the Utility segment on Page 5. And again, you can see solid operational performance with double-digit operating profit growth and about 1.5 points of margin expansion. The sales growth of 4% is driven by the acquisition of Systems Control. It's also supported by double-digit growth in our transmission and substation product areas as well as in protection and controls. And that was partially offset by the weakness we continue to feel in the telecom enclosures area where we were down 20%. And in the utility distribution products area, where we're continuing to experience customer inventory rationalization.\nWe believe that, that is starting to isolate in the distribution products set only and specifically with the larger investor-owned utilities as opposed to the munis and co-ops. So we can see that inventory issue getting narrowed into the finite area. The operating profit driven the growth of 12%, up to 22.9% margin. It was really driven by managing price again as well as productivity benefits from prior year investments and the new acquisition of Systems Control coming in not only providing dollars but coming in at attractive margins.\nSo kind of underscoring and highlighting where Gerben was commenting on the capital allocation, you can see really helping the utility segment here in the fourth quarter. I think 2 areas of note that I would add we talked about sales in the distribution products area. And I think it's important to talk about orders. So the orders in the fourth quarter on the Transmission & Distribution area were solid. We saw the customers, as we say, queuing up for '25 deliveries rather than looking for shipments to be received in December. And that book-to-bill in the grid infrastructure area was above one for the first time since early 2023.\nFavorable order trend, actually, continued through January into our New Year here. And so we think that above one book-to-bill is strongly suggestive that the effects of the destocking we've been experiencing are fading here in 2025.\nThe second area of note is the grid automation sales being down 11%. I think it's important to point out the challenging comparison -- the fourth quarter of last year had growth of 37%. So super normal growth that had been driven by us delivering on the backlog and the breakthrough of the chip shortage. In addition, we had some project roll-offs in a lumpy business. So 3 strong quarters of growth and then the fourth quarter contracting. We're expecting because the compare was also strong in the first quarter of '24. So we're expecting this kind of trend to continue in the first quarter of '25 and then improvement through the balance of 3 quarters of '25 after that.\nWe thought it would be worthwhile to pull back the lens and utility from the fourth quarter to the full year. And on Page 6, we provided you with an image of some of the headwinds and tailwinds and some of the moving pieces that we navigated through. And I think we think showing you the resilience of our business model and its ability to perform despite some headwinds. And we think this also illustrates a strong setup for '25. So thinking about headwinds on the page, looking into specialty infrastructure which is the business unit that has both enclosures and our gas distribution products.\nWe've been talking to you all year about the softness there. We've been talking about strong declines in percentage terms, but also a high-margin business. And so the combination of that leads to the significant headwind that you see there. But the addition of Systems Control and again, underscoring Gerben's point about capital allocation, investing in the substation market, which offers us high growth as well as high margins. And so you see a really strong contribution to '24. It happens to be an area that is experiencing good book-to-bill and backlog build. And that backlog gives us a strong visibility to '25 and is supportive of us having a high single-digit growth expectations for that business unit this year in '25.\nAnd so a strong contributor in its first year and expecting continued strength in its second year. In the T&D area, we talked about the distribution side having the temporary effects of the inventory being managed down by both the channel and the end user but we grew mid-single digits driven by the strength in Transmission and substations, so you can see positive contribution from T&D infrastructure. And you also see the positive contribution from grid automation.\nWe talked about how it ended and that's the end of the fourth quarter, it's really driven inside the meters and comm side. There's the grid protection and controls products also in there. Those are strong growth, and we're expecting that to continue into 2025 as well. So in sum, we're feeling that for 2024, generating 9% operating profit growth. And again, reminding ourselves that we're compounding now on top of 50% growth over the prior 2 years of '22 and '23.\nAnd we think this is really showing tribute to our strong position. We've got quality products, quality customer relationships, and we're getting those customers the high-quality products at the right time and the right price. And we think that shows that we're poised to grow. And the 2 temporary areas of softness in '24, we think, are both inflecting to the positive for '25. So Gerben is going to give you the outlook, but we think this is a good setup for us in utility.\nSo Page 7, I'm going to go back to the Electrical segment and the fourth quarter perspective, and you see the benefits of this multiyear transformation of the Electrical segment continuing where we see strong execution in Q4 with 10% operating profit growth and about 3.5 points of margin expansion. The top line is down slightly when you exclude the divestiture of resi. And when you exclude the impact of our PCX acquisition, which is [indiscernible] product redesign with a key customer, and that really caused a 4-point drag to the segment in the quarter and not unlike systems control, PCX also with some visibility backlog and give us some confidence and a strong '25.\nBut we also, in the top line, had strength on renewables and data center balance of system. Our light industrial markets were very strong. And I would contrast that to some of the softer trends in commercial and heavy industrial. I think operating profit up double digits. It's been driven by the exit of the resi lighting and strengthening the margin profile of the segment, good price and productivity improvements and Gerben referred to the business simplification and efficiency initiatives that it has a multiyear still in front of its benefit to come. So we feel there's -- we're looking at a multiyear road map here of a strong quarter for Electrical segment, strong year and looking forward to strong contributions next year and turn it back to Gerben to share our outlook for '25.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. I will end our prepared remarks with a brief overview of our 2025 outlook, starting with organic growth expectations on Slide 8. We anticipate 4% to 5% organic growth in 2025. This is consistent with the mid-single-digit long-term framework we provided at our Investor Day last June. And our expectations by markets are consistent with the early preview we shared with you in October.\nWe anticipate 4% to 6% organic growth in our Utility Solutions segment as we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on electrification-driven load growth and interconnection projects across transmission, substation and grid protection and controls market. While we expect our meters and AMI business to decline year-over-year in 2025, we are confident that telecom markets and high-margin utility distribution markets will return to growth.\nIn Electrical Solutions, we anticipate 3% to 5% organic growth in '25 and we continue to make significant progress in our transformation of the HES segment to compete collectively in high-growth verticals, and we expect GDP plus growth in 2025. Most notably, we anticipate mid-teens growth in our data center business as artificial intelligence drives accelerated build-out of large projects, and we anticipate solid mid-single-digit growth across renewables and electrical T&D markets.\nWhile macroeconomic uncertainty drives a more muted outlook in commercial and heavy industrial markets, we see high visibility to continued electrical mega project activity driving relative strength across light industrial markets.\nTurning to Slide 9. We anticipate mid-single-digit organic growth and continued adjusted operating margin expansion to drive full year adjusted earnings per share of $17.35 to $17.85 and free cash flow conversion of at least 90% of adjusted net income. We expect 2025 performance to primarily be driven by volume growth, and we are confident that our unique leading positions in attractive end markets will enable us to achieve these targets. We continue to proactively manage price/cost productivity across our portfolio and we expect positive contributions from PCP and restructuring benefits, partially offset by a return of investment spending needed to drive further growth and productivity initiatives.\nFrom a nonoperating standpoint, we anticipate a higher year-over-year tax rate and other expenses to be partially offset by lower net interest expense. I am confident in our ability to deliver on our initial 2025 outlook, which represents continued attractive growth across our key financial metrics and would reflect an adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating profit CAGR above 20% over a 5-year period.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Q&A.",

Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter of 2024. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com.\nJoined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nPlease note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference to this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's second quarter 2024 results. Hubbell delivered strong operating performance in the quarter, generating 8% year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth and 40 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion along with 7% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Given our first half performance and continued visibility into the second half, we are raising our 2024 outlook this morning and are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted operating profit growth on a full year basis.\nPerformance in the quarter was highlighted by strong organic growth and margin expansion in the Electrical Solutions where robust project activity drove strong growth in data center and renewables markets and where our vertical market strategy is uniquely positioning Hubbell to serve the needs of our customers.\nAs we highlighted at our Investor Day in June, is executing on 2 strategic focus areas to compete collectively in high-growth verticals while also simplifying our business to drive productivity and operating efficiencies. We are making good progress on both of these initiatives, and we also continue to benefit from our portfolio transformation efforts, which align the segment to structurally higher growth and margins over the long term.\nIn Utility Solutions, while we continue to be impacted by weak telecom markets and to a lesser extent, customer inventory normalization and utility distribution market as anticipated, T&D end market demand remains strong. Transmission and substation markets achieved robust double-digit growth in the quarter as utility customers invest in upgrading the grid infrastructure to interconnect new sources of renewable generation with load growth from data centers and other electrical applications.\nAs we highlighted to you last month, our leadership across T&D markets and strong relationships with utility customers uniquely positions Hubbell for sustained outperformance over an attractive long-term utility investment cycle as grid modernization and electrification megatrends accelerate. Operationally, we drove positive price/cost productivity across both segments while continuing to invest in capacity and productivity initiatives, including another quarter of higher year-over-year restructuring and related investments.\nOverall, we are pleased with our operating performance in the quarter, even while absorbing pockets of challenges in certain large, high-margin businesses Hubbell is proving the ability to compound off of recent outperformance. This is a testament to the quality of our portfolio, the attractiveness of secular trends we are exposed to and the strength of our people and operating model.\nWith that, let me now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gerben, very much, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate you joining us recognize there's a number of releases this morning. I'm going to start my comments on Page 4 of the materials. You can see a strong performance in the second quarter by Hubbell exceeded our own expectations, thanks really to contributions from the Electrical segment.\nI think they came in the form of strong market growth in targeted verticals as well as good execution on the productivity and cost front. So turning to sales, 7% growth to $1.45 billion. That 7% is comprised of 2% organic which is all priced at 2 points and 5 points of acquired sales, and that's a net number.\nJust to remind everybody, we had 8% contribution from acquisitions from 3 different deals that were closed last year, and we had minus 3% headwind from the divestiture of residential lighting that we effected earlier this year. So plus 8% and minus 3% netting to 5% from M&A. Independent of the impact on volumes, you'll see benefits on the margin front from these portfolio reshaping when we get into some of the segment result pages, and I think it's been beneficial to our enterprise to exit lower growth, lower margin businesses and add higher growth, higher-margin businesses.\nAnd I think we're getting dividends from that acquisition program.\nTurning to OP operationally, you see 22.8% margins, expansion of 40 basis points year-over-year, quite important as we finish the year to keep improving on those margins. The margin story was driven by a big performance in Electrical, which we'll talk about in a couple of pages. Utility had sequential improvement in operating profit quarter-over-quarter and favorable price/cost, productivity performance in both segments showing really good execution.\nWe're having success with pricing realization and some of the investments we made last year, resulting in some productivity improvement inside the factories this year. So good performance on the PCP side earnings per share, 7% growth to $4.37 adjusted EPS. So up above, we had 8% OP contribution and an increase in interest expense, which aligns to 7% earnings growth. On the free cash flow side, $206 million on track at halfway point here to hit our target of $800 million for the year.\nTurning to Page 5. I wanted to take advantage of these visual graphs and take us back about 1.5 months to Investor Day and really remind us of what I thought was 1 of the most important takeaways from that Investor Day, which was to pull the lens back for the last 3-year period, remind ourselves of how much improvement there was in Hubbell's performance in 2022 and 2023. And basically, at Investor Day, we described that bigger and better Hubbell being the base off of which we are now going to grow and improve and get even bigger and better.\nSo using Page 5 to illustrate that takeaway in sales, to remind everybody, in '22 and '23, we had a compound annual growth rate of 14% off of that much higher base, we continue to grow sales 6%. On the upper right of the graph, you see operating profit. I remind everybody that in '22 and '23, a compound growth rate of 38% and off of those higher levels we're growing another 8%.\nAnd earnings per share on the lower left, to remind everyone, '22 and '23, we had a compound annual growth rate of 36% and we're continuing to grow 7% off that base. So I just really wanted to illustrate that point of how we're growing off that improved performance level.\nPage 6, let's start to unpack the performance by segment, and we'll start with the Utility segment. And there's really 2 halves to the story here, the sales and the OP and I'm going to start with sales, which are up 12% to $927 million. Those sales are comprised sales growth is comprised almost entirely of acquisitions with the organic down slightly. And we had a similar shape in the first quarter where both grid infrastructure and grid automation, the 2 units contributed double digits to the growth.\nSo let's unpack and start. I'm on kind of the lower left of the page and grid infrastructure being the first unit. Sales are up 12%, and that's really driven by the systems control acquisition that we closed in December. To remind everyone that is an integrated solutions provider for substations, for utility businesses. Business is doing really well since we've added it's growing at attractive margin levels. So the acquisition driving sales, the organic is down mid-single digit, and that's driven by the telecom end market that we talked about at some length in the first quarter.\nAnd the results are very similar to that first quarter down 40%. I think we're starting to feel the bottom there. and we'll start to look forward to some slightly easier compares in the second half. And I think sometimes over the last 2 quarters, that performance of the telecom market has somewhat taken away from the picture of what's going on in our core transmission and distribution business, which is growing organically and expanding margins. So very, very healthy there, the strength this year has been in the transmission and substation side of things. We really see robust project activity involving both new miles of construction as well as grid interconnections.\nOn the distribution side of T&D, we continue to have -- we continue to have to navigate through some end customer destocking. It's not significant enough to prevent T&D from growing, but still a headwind. And that headwinds in particular areas like poll-in hardware that are typically more on shelves and stock.\nSo let's pivot from that top grade infrastructure unit to the grid automation unit at the bottom. You see sales up double digits, organic growth up at 8%. And we continue to have AMI, which is the comms part and meters conversion of backlog, and there continues to be strength in grid protection controls demand, resulting in a smarter and more resilient grid. So I want to talk about margins on the right side of the page, which I think is a really important part of Page 6. So importantly, those margins from the first quarter are up sequentially, 220 basis points. So very nice execution from Q1 to Q2. You see an increase of 4% in dollars to $222 million. You see a decline year-over-year in margin from 25.6% to 24%.\nAnd basically, of the drivers on the lower right part of the page, you see 3 of them are headwinds. The most important of which is the decrementals on the telecom volume which explains essentially the entire drop. In addition to that, we increased our restructuring investments, which was a drag on margins. And I mentioned the systems control acquisition being at attractive margin levels happens to be below last year's level slightly. So it creates a little bit of headwind. And so the fact that price/cost productivity is basically offsetting both the restructuring and acquisition effects, we think, sets us up importantly for a good second half in Utility margins.\nSo I'm going to continue to Page 7 and talk about the Electrical segment. And you see really strong performance turned in by our electrical team in sales grew 7% organically, while margins expanded 350 basis points to north of 20% level. The growth was driven primarily by our targeted vertical markets, most notably data centers and renewables. And a couple of things of note there. One, obviously, the markets are growing rapidly. Two is, we have a really good suite of products and solutions like connectors and grounding products that fit well with that segment and are helping our customers.\nAnd we've made some strides towards competing collectively there, which we think both assists cross-selling, product development and makes us easier to do business with. And we think that's helping us. These are relatively small businesses for us, comprising approximately 15% of the segment sales. But because the growth rates are so significant, they're actually driving a lot of the incremental growth. Beyond the verticals, though, I think the markets are in solid shape. Industrial markets, in particular, solid.\nWe think nonres is pretty steady. And importantly, for us on this electrical side, we've really exited the period of destocking that we were navigating through last year. On the margin side, you see 18% growth to $109 million and about 350 basis points expansion to 20.8%. I think one of the biggest effects there has been the disposition of the resi lighting business. And in the absence of that, we reduced sales by 9% in the segment, but we added over 50 basis points to this margin story.\nIn addition to the absence of that business, we have incremental drop-throughs on as volumes return post destocking and in particular, in the highly attractive vertical markets of data center and renewables. And we have price cost productivity, favorability, good price realization with stick rates and good productivity. You heard Mark Mikes, our leader of this segment at Investor Day talk about looking to compete collectively and drive efficiencies and looking forward to Mark's continued strong performance here in this segment.\nWith that, I want to turn it back to Gerben to focus on a couple of areas of growth.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And before I go to the full year outlook, I want to take the opportunity and just highlight a couple of growth areas for us. And as Bill just talked about in the segment discussions, we are seeing some strong pockets of growth in specific markets and product lines within our businesses. And one of the themes that emerges when you look across the performance of the portfolio, is that some of the strongest growth is in the areas which tend to be exposed early in the industrial project cycle, in particular, in data center and renewables verticals across both utility and electrical markets.\nFor example, Hubbell has a leading position in electrical grounding with our Burndy brand, where we are highly specified across key end markets with the premier grounding solution in the industry. These products are typically installed early in a project cycle once construction breaks ground and year-to-date revenue in this product category is up over 30%, which much of that growth being driven by data center and renewable projects.\nThis is a positive indicator for continued market growth in these areas as we continue to execute on our vertical market strategy and pull through other specified solutions as these projects progress. In Utility Solutions, Bill highlighted strong growth in transmission and distribution and transmission and substation markets. And as we think about substations, this market is very much at the intersection of trends in renewables and data center as substations are needed to interconnect new sources of generation and load.\nWe have a strong position in utility substation and one of those key product categories is substation switching, which is a critical solution enabling utilities to isolate portions of the grid for maintenance and repair. We have realized over 40% sales growth in this product category in the first half with orders and demand outstripping sales.\nAs we consider the longer-term impact of load growth on the grid, Hubbell is uniquely positioned with our offerings across transmission, substation and distribution to enable the upgrading of this aged infrastructure. We believe that grid modernization and electrification will continue to drive growth across our portfolio over a multiyear investment cycle.\nWe have positioned our portfolio and our strategy to take advantage of these opportunities and to serve the needs of our customers, both in front and behind the meter.\nNow turning to our outlook for the second half and full year. Hubbell is raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook this morning to a range of $16.20 to $16.50. We currently anticipate 7% to 8% sales growth and approximately 3% organic growth for the full year with adjusted operating margins of 21% to 21.5%. This represents double-digit free cash flow and adjusted operating profit growth at the midpoint as well as solid adjusted operating margin expansion off of strong 2023 levels.\nOur first half performance puts us well on track to achieve this increased full year outlook. Looking ahead to the second half, we see continued momentum in execution in Electrical Solutions and we expect utility solutions to achieve improved levels of organic growth while returning to year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion.\nLonger term, we remain confident in Hubbell's ability to compound on recent outperformance. At our Investor Day last month, we laid out a multiyear financial outlook for mid-single-digit organic growth and attractive incremental margins, along with strong free cash flow generation and deployment as grid modernization and electrification megatrends accelerate into 2025 and beyond, Hubbell is well positioned to consistently deliver on these commitments while serving the growing needs of our utility and electrical customers.\nWith that, let me now turn the call back over to Shannon for the Q&A session.",

Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Hubbell Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would like now to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2024. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. .\nJoined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nPlease note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference into this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's first quarter 2024 results. Hubbell is off to a solid start to '24 and we are well on track to deliver on our full year outlook, which contemplates double-digit adjusted operating profit growth at the midpoint.\nPerformance in the quarter was highlighted by strong organic growth and margin expansion in Electrical Solutions. Electrification and U.S. manufacturing activity is driving broad-based strength across our markets, most notably in renewables and data centers, which continued to grow double digits in the quarter.\nOur Connectors and Grounding business, which is strategically positioned in these verticals and -- as well as in broader industrial markets, realized double-digit sales growth in the quarter.\nWe also continued to make progress in our HES segment unification strategy, with 80 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter despite increased restructuring investment and footprint optimization.\nWith the completion of our residential lighting divestiture in February, we are confident that our Electrical Solutions portfolio is aligned to structurally higher growth and margins going forward.\nIn our Utility Solutions segment, performance in our core utility T&D markets was solid, driven primarily by strength in our grid automation businesses and transmission markets. As anticipated, utility distribution markets continue to be impacted by channel inventory normalization, though end market demand remains solid.\nWe're also pleased with the positive contributions from our acquisitions in the quarter. Systems control is off to a good start, and the integration is running smoothly while Balestro and EIG delivered strong results in the quarter.\nTelecom markets were weak in the quarter, driving significant sales and margin declines in our utility and closures business. While we continue to have a positive outlook on the long-term growth prospect of fiber deployment and broadband access, we expect this weakness to persist in the second quarter and are taking additional targeted actions in response.\nBill will walk you through the details within the quarter in a few minutes. But overall, we are confident in the setup for Utility Solutions over the balance of 2024 as our leadership in attractive utility T&D markets positions us well to meet the grid modernization and electrification needs of our customers.\nFrom an operational standpoint, we executed well in the quarter against a challenging prior year comparison. We're very pleased with our early traction on price realization which continues to be supported by a strong position and leading service levels. While the operating environment remains inflationary, we achieved positive price/cost productivity in both segments in the quarter.\nAs we highlighted throughout 2023, we accelerated our investment levels as the year progressed in areas such as innovation and engineering, capacity and lean as well as sourcing and procurement. These investments continued in the first quarter, and we are confident they will deliver attractive payback through higher long-term growth and productivity levels.\nBefore I turn it over to Bill, I wanted to share some insights from our Hubbell Utility Connect Customer Conference a few weeks ago. We hosted over 400 utility customers to showcase our solutions across each of our brands, product lines and end markets. This was the first time Hubbell held a customer event of this magnitude across the entire utility solutions franchise. And I'd like to thank Greg Gums and his leadership team for creating a unique forum for us to engage with our customers to educate and collectively problem solve to make our critical infrastructure more reliable and resilient.\nKey takeaways from several days of discussions with our largest customers were are clear, utilities are in investment mode. Our customers anticipate a multiyear T&D investment cycle as the combined effects of aging infrastructure, renewables, electrification and load growth will require more hardened infrastructure as well as unique solutions to emerging challenges.\nHubbell's leading quality and service levels together with our proactive investments in capacity and innovation will position us well to grow with our customers as their investment levels accelerate in the coming years.\nIn particular, utility customers are focused on the impact of load growth driven by data center power consumption. While this phenomenon is still early days, the impact to our customers is real and will require incremental investment over a period of many years as large projects progress and require grid interconnections.\nHigher growth and more specifically, higher peak load growth will require more transmission and substation infrastructure, areas where Hubbell has recently doubled down and will be well positioned to serve. It also means novel solutions and grid modernization will be required to solve the emerging problems and Hubbell's unique leadership across utility components, communications and control will enable us to partner with our customers for continued long-term success.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Bill for more details in the quarter.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gerb. Good morning, everybody. We're well aware that you're all over schedule. There's a lot of releases today. So we appreciate you taking time to discuss Hubbell's performance.\nMy comments are starting on Page 5 of the slides that you hopefully found. And overall, the enterprise performed solidly, a little bit better than we anticipated. Then that had some puts and takes, but very consistent with our full year outlook and our expectations of normal seasonality.\nOur sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, a high single-digit growth. Organic was about 2% of that, inorganic about 6%, so we'll talk about the inorganic story quickly. 3 acquisitions contributing in the quarter. Systems Control, which is a substation turnkey solution business; Balestro, which helping our arresters business; and EIG, which is power control components, all 3 in the utility segment, contributing about 8.5 points of growth in the quarter. And we closed on residential lighting disposition in very early February. So we lost 2 months of sales in the first quarter, and that cost us about 2 points.\nSo I think that's the quantitative side of the inorganic, but qualitatively, we feel we meaningfully added to the growth and margin profile of the enterprise.\nOperating profit at attractive levels of 19.7%, down 1 point, better-than-expected performance on price cost productivity was more than offset by decremental and our Enclosures business, which as well -- is where the telecom exposure is and higher investment levels in growth and productivity, including some restructuring spending, which we'll talk more about when we get to the segment review.\nEarnings per share was $3.60, flat to last year, and operating profit dollar growth was offset by interest expense and free cash flow on track to deliver our full year outlook of $800 million.\nWe'll dig down on Page 6 a little bit deeper into the performance and specifically, we're showing the year-over-year compares. And as we do that, it's worth a mention of the first quarter of 2023 was -- it's quite a difficult compare, really, really strong performance last year where price cost was a particularly strong tailwind. It was pre destock and pre-investments that we made. And -- maybe just to remind everybody, we had OP and earnings per share up 70% and margins up 7 points.\nSo I think that context is important as we look to the year-over-year compares. Sales were up, as we said, 9% to $1.4 billion, 2% of that was organic, which is comprised of 3 points of price really driving the top line, volume was slightly down and we're quite pleased with that price performance showing real strength of our franchise.\nThe operating profit is up 3% in dollars to $275 million. And as we talked about the difficult compare year-over-year because you see it's down 1 point, it's worth commenting on the sequential, where we see margins up 30 basis points sequentially. So we think that's quite positive to setting up a normal seasonal year.\nEarnings per share at $3.60 flat to last year. The OP was offset by interest expense from the 3 companies that we bought. I mentioned those, the combined value of that investment was about $1.25 billion. And it's worth maybe a comment on how the balance sheet absorbed that level of investment.\nWe financed those 3 acquisitions with a combination of debt and cash and also sold a business, as we mentioned. So the balance sheet impact of all that, we went from 1.3x gross debt to EBITDA, we increased a half turn to 1.8x. So after investing $1.25 billion, we're still a very, very solid balance sheet, very easily absorbed and very well positioned to continue to invest in acquisitions and CapEx, which I'll talk about in a second.\nWhen you see free cash flow at $52 million, and I did want to highlight that, that's absorbing a 20% increase in capital expenditures to $40 million. And I really think that our confidence in our short and medium-term outlook, you can see that when we're ramping up CapEx at the 20% level. So I think we'll learn a lot as we dig into the segments.\nWe'll start with the Utility segment on Page 7. I see sales up 14% and OP, up 2%, and -- the 14% growth in sales is essentially all acquisitions. The organic is neutral where there's 3 points of price and offset by a similar size decline in volume.\nYou'll see with the bold words on the lower left, that we've reclassified the businesses into these 2 units to be consistent with the way Greg has organized his operating team. So grid infrastructure versus grid automation.\nIn grid infrastructure. We have our traditional T&D business, we have the new acquisition that's in substation turnkey solutions and we have some specialty infrastructure businesses namely enclosures and gas components. That's all in the grid infrastructure area.\nAnd then in automation, we have Aclara, which is the meters and the communications products as well as protection and control products. You'll recall the name Beckwith with controls as well as switching infusing products, which are providing the protection.\nSo we'll show you on the next page all the sizes and what to expect from those. But the Infrastructure Business was -- and the Core Utility Business performed very, very well. Transmission up double digits. Distribution, still going through their channel inventory normalization. We're getting near the end of that persisting a little longer than we expected as we think the channel has worked -- largely worked its way through, but we think the end customers are still holding some inventory. So we're getting closer to putting that behind us.\nAnd when we get to the Electrical segment next, you'll see that they went through the same last year and have emerged very healthily. So really good PCP performance in that T&D business and said it's very constructively for its financial performance.\nGrid Automation, likewise, double-digit growth both in the meters and comm area, but also in the control and protection area. So really strong contribution there. The headwind is really coming from the telecom sector, which is inside that Specialty Infrastructure Business and are really enclosures that we make for the Telecom segment.\nThey are navigating both channel and customer inventory normalization period, creating a significant headwind with a 40% decline in volumes. The business line is very profitable. And so it's creating an OP drag. So the effect of that is about 4 points on the segment top line and as you can see about 1.5 points on the OP line.\nSo the OP for the segment is up 2%. Again, to remind you of the compare last year the utility OP was up 87%. So growing off of that is very impressive. A decline of 2.5 points of margin being led by the decrementals in telecom.\nAnd to be clear, our medium-term outlook for Telecom Business is quite positive. And we've also made -- continue to make investments in the long-term growth and productivity of the segment. Those created about 1 point of drag and the acquisitions that we mentioned, which are all doing really well and are all performing very profitably, but against that mid-20s level actually created a 0.5 point of drag essentially in the first quarter of systems control being part of all.\nSo still, I think, very good performance there. And the price/cost productivity equation was positive. So -- Again, we're showing you the year-over-year compares. I do want to highlight sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year, the margins are up 40 bps. So we're feeling again like we're setting up for a successful normal seasonality year-on-year.\nI wanted to add a page, on Page 8, just to make sure we're being clear about our nomenclature and where we have the different business units. So on the left, you can see the grid infrastructure comprising 75% of the segment and the balance is grid automation. You can see from about noon to about 6:00 there on the pie. That's the traditional T&D businesses between substation, transmission and distribution. Then from about 6:00 -- or 7:00 to 9:00, you can see the telecom and gas, which represents the specialty. And then from 9:00 to noon, you see the Aclara utility meters and then the protection products. So hopefully, that gives some clarity to the relative sizes of those different businesses.\nAnd we just added a little bit because they're not all performing exactly the same. So we wanted to lay out first quarter trends against what we're expecting for the balance of the year.\nAnd Distribution, we're expecting that sequential improvement, Transmission substation very strong. Telecom was weak, as we said, and we're anticipating some softness, but again, where -- the rebound will come in the medium term. And so balancing our cost cutting there against being able to serve when demand comes back, it's representing interesting challenge.\nMeters has been successful on its backlog conversion. We expect that to continue. We're noting the comps get a little more difficult for them, and the Protection and Controls product is very strong.\nSo in sum in Utility, very pleased with the pricing of these segments. We've got strong visibility in the majority of our markets and we're expecting the normal seasonality and a nice healthy set up, really, we think, a uniquely positioned business.\nSo I want to switch to -- on Page 9 to the Electrical segment, a little bit more straightforward to explain to everybody. You see flat sales at about $500 million, you take out the effect of the divestiture of residential lighting.\nWe were up 6 points organically, 2 points of price, which we're pleased about. 4 points of volume, which we're also pleased about as they emerge from their destocking and helps give us confidence that, that will be quick on the utility side as well.\nThere's strength in industrial markets, but also specifically in what we describe as our growth verticals of renewables as well as data centers. which are up to over 20% each.\nSo great to see Electrical Solutions performing so well on the top line, that's translating nicely at the OP level, you see a 6% increase to $80 million and 80 basis point expansion of margin on both the volume and price cost performance.\nWe would call out that Mark and his team, as we've discussed with you all are continuing to execute on the playbook that he so successfully implemented at Power Systems to create a more compete collectively mindset in the segment. really emphasizing cross-selling, optimizing the footprint, simplifying the structure.\nSo there's some R&R spending to be done and we would have added another 5 points of OP growth, i.e., being double digits and another 80 bps of margin expansion if we were to adjust out that restructuring as many of our peers do. Like great to see Electrical having such a solid quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Gerben on our outlook for the balance of the year.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. So to sum it up, our performance in the first quarter with Hubbell well on track to achieve our full year 2024 outlook for double-digit adjusted operating profit growth, which we are reaffirming today. .\nRelative to our prior outlook, our Electrical markets are off to a stronger start, and we have better visibility to positive price traction across both of our segments, which we believe will enable us to absorb the near-term impact of weaker telecom markets.\nAdditionally, we are increasing our expectations for full year restructuring investments from $0.25 to $0.35 and -- as we proactively manage our cost structure in certain areas of the business while continuing to invest in the long-term growth and productivity initiatives.\nLooking further ahead, the acceleration of grid modernization and electrification megatrends together with our unique leading positions in front of and behind the meter will enable Hubbell to continue to deliver differentiated performance for our shareholders over the long term.\nWe look forward to sharing more details on our long-term strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day on June 4.\nWith that, let me now turn it back to Michelle to begin our Q&A session.",

Welcome to Hubbell's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Phoebe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter of 2023. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release considered incorporated by reference to this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides. Now let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's Fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Hubbell delivered a strong finish to an exceptional year. For the full year 2023, we achieved 9% sales growth, over 500 basis points of operating margin expansion and over 40% growth in operating profit and earnings per share. These results were driven not only by our strong positions in attractive markets but also by the consistent execution of our people and maintaining industry-leading service levels for our customers while driving price and productivity across our businesses. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to invest back into our business in capacity, innovation and productivity initiatives. We invested $165 million in capital expenditures in 2023, almost double our investment levels from 2021. We are confident that these investments will drive future growth and productivity for our shareholders. And as we will describe in more detail later, we intend to grow profitably off of a strong multiyear base of performance.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong growth and margin expansion in both segments. Notably, we also returned to year-over-year volume growth in Electrical Solutions. As we noted on our previous call in October, we were confident that the channel inventory management that we had seen earlier in the year had largely normalized. As a result, we saw stronger seasonal performance in the fourth quarter as well as continued strength across data centers and renewables verticals. We also continued the trajectory of strong margin expansion in the Electrical segment, ending the year with adjusted operating margins of 16.6%. We continue to see structural margin expansion opportunities as we make progress in our strategy of competing collectively as an operating segment and we plan to accelerate our restructuring investment in 2024 to drive long-term productivity.\nUtility Solutions, fourth quarter trends were largely consistent with the third quarter. Transmission markets were strong, and we continue to convert on past due backlog in communications and control as supply chain conditions have improved. Utility distribution markets continue to be impacted by channel inventory normalization as anticipated, though we continue to see visible demand strength in 2024 and beyond. Telecom markets were weak in the quarter. And while our long-term outlook here remains positive, we are taking a cautious initial view on 2024 until we have more visibility on timing of investments. We also executed on two important portfolio actions in the quarter as we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Systems Control and announced a definitive agreement to sell our residential lighting business, which we expect to close in early February. These transactions reflect our ongoing strategy to create a focused portfolio strategically aligned around grid modernization and electrification. These transactions improved the long-term growth and margin profile of our portfolio, and we anticipate that they will be net accretive to 2024 adjusted earnings per share.\nWe will provide more details on our '24 outlook at the end of this call, but we remain confident that Hubbell is uniquely positioned in attractive markets and that we can build off the success of this last several years to drive profitable growth of this higher base of performance. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to walk you through the details of the quarter.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Gerb, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to have the chance to discuss with you our financial performance in the fourth quarter, which was very strong, capping a strong year and frankly, a strong 2 years. I'm going to start my comments on Page 4 of the slides that I hope you found. So the trends have been in place, really, for the last year and longer strong sales growth and operating profit growth, including margin expansion, being driven by strong markets as well as strong pricing and strong cash flow is resulting. And those fundamental trends are obviously continuing here in the fourth quarter. So we reported $1.35 billion of sales, 10% growth, 2% of that comes from acquisitions, 8% is organic. The utility segment, a little bit stronger than electrical. But as Gerben noted, quite important for electrical volumes to return to growth as a sign that the inventory in the channel is normalized on that side of the house. Interesting to sequentially, the fourth quarter seasonally stronger than is typical. So we think that's a good sign.\nOn the operating profit margin side, you see 19.4%, 3 points of expansion really being driven by price cost and productivity and creating some source of funding for investments that Gerben had described. Earnings per share at $3.69, a 40% increase to prior year. and $284 million in free cash flow, helping to fund our CapEx and acquisition investments. So let's double-click on that on Page 5 and go one layer deeper. So the 10% sales we said was 8% organic. That was comprised of mid-single digits of price. We think that's good evidence of our quality of service and our brand positioning and low single digits of volume and welcome, as I said, the return to electrical volume growth. The 2% coming from acquisitions were all on the utility side, and we'll talk about those more when we get to the utility page. On the upper right, operating profit up 34% to $262 million. The margin expansion of 3 points really being driven by price as well as materials which continued to provide a tailwind as they had for each quarter in 2023. So the inflation that we're experiencing is more on the wage and transportation side that's where we're focusing a lot of productivity efforts, as well as we're absorbing there some operational productivity investment going on.\nOn the lower left, you see earnings per share up 42%, a slightly higher growth rate than the operating profit. So below the line, we benefited from some tax rate favorability. And on the free cash flow side, you see $284 million, nearly a 60% increase. And for the full year, we generated over $700 million of cash flow and that supported a CapEx of around $165 million, which really helped drive some footprint restructuring, productivity and capacity investing. So let's unpack the enterprise into the two segments, and we'll start with utilities on Page 6, and you'll see another excellent quarter from our utility team, double-digit sales growth and 40% operating profit growth, 13% sales growth is comprised of 9% organic and 4% from acquisitions. The acquisitions to remind everybody included EIG, which was our second quarter of ownership there, Bolestrone and systems control. Systems control was closed in the middle of December, so didn't contribute much yet. And we are reporting both Bolesterone systems control in our T&D components and EIG is in the comms and control side. We'll talk more about acquisitions in a minute and the last few years plus this year.\nAs we think about the 9% organic growth you'll see that it was skewed towards the communications and control side. If I start with transmission and distribution components, you'll see organic, it was at 1% where volume was a drag on price. And if we look inside the components, substation and transmission continued to be very strong. Distribution components, we continue to work through our second quarter of channel inventory management. I think as we had mentioned before, our electrical side had experience that quicker and sooner earlier really than utility side. So we've emerged on the electrical side still in on the distribution side. And then telecom has been weak a function of some overstocked inventories as well as potential demand impacts from a combination of high interest rates and some customers who are waiting for stimulus dollars to kick off their projects.\nYou see on the communications and controls, surging growth there, we've got both the Aclara and Beckwith businesses there. On the Aclara side, the chips supply chain opening up has really allowed them to satisfy some existing backlog. And so we see some great growth there. Also to remind there was -- we have an easy compare there as last year, we had a commercial settlement that was a contra sales item. And Beckwith as well, which makes protective relays and controls up double digits in sales. So very strong top line performance by the segment and even better on the OP side, a growth of 40% to $174 million, over 21% margins. And the price cost story is the same volume growth contributing and we continue to make investments. So from a full year, this is obviously all fourth quarter performance just at the bottom of the page, a full year comment on profit growth of about 60%. So congratulations to Greg and his team on just a really outstanding year.\nOn Page 7, we've got the Electrical segment. And you see mid-single-digit sales growth with 2 points of margin expansion strong performance from the electrical team. And of that 6% sales growth, it's comprised of about half of that is price and half volume. Net volume, as we said, we thought in October that the channel inventories would be normalized and rebalanced and that did occur in the fourth quarter, which is good news. The volume came from some important verticals. Data centers was a big one. Recall last year, we bought PCX, which is performing really strongly serving that segment. Burndy as well as serving that segment. Burndy is also benefiting from the renewable vertical and a little bit of U.S. reshoring on the industrial side. So some favorable trends there, allowing for that volume growth. And on the profit side, you see 20% growth, 2 points of margin expansion as operating profit reached $88 million again, the price cost really helping as well as the return to volume growth. And full year comment I'll make on electrical like I did on the utility side, we saw 20% growth in operating profit in the segment with 2.5 points of margin expansion. So I think a very successful year for the electrical and looking forward to Mark Mikes and his team continuing to push the segment to compete collectively where we think there's more growth and more margin available to us there.\nI mentioned that I wanted to talk about the portfolio management. And on Page 8, we've laid out the last few years of activity, just to remind ourselves of our intentions here. And I'll start with the divestitures where we have three companies divested in a fourth under definitive agreement that we're hoping to close in early February. And you see those businesses netted us $500 million of proceeds, and our intention here is to make sure we're investing in higher growth, higher margin businesses. And you'll see that, that $500 million we rolled into $1.7 billion of acquisitions, numbering about 10 over the last few years. And you can see in the large blue bubble of T&D components where we added Cantega, Ripley, ArmorCast, Bolestrone and in the yellow bubble there of connection and bonding adding connector products. So those very intentionally adding businesses to our high-margin, high-growth areas as well as in specific growth verticals like substation systems, like grid automation, data centers, PCX I mentioned and wireless communications of CellTech. So, we think we are enhancing the growth and margin profile of the company. I didn't want to pause because of systems controls recent closing as well as its size, on the impact on capital structure. So that was $1.1 billion purchase price that we funded with some cash as well as some CPE and a term loan A provided by our supportive bank group. The result of that is a flexible and prepayable capital structure, which we think gives us some optionality and results in very manageable debt levels of 1.8x debt-to-EBITDA on a net debt basis around 1.5%. So we feel like that were improving the portfolio. And I'll talk about the specific impacts of the acquisitions on our guidance in another couple of pages.\nSo as we switch to outlook, let's start on Page 10 with the markets, and then we'll talk about how those markets roll through our earnings expectations. So, we've got the Utility Segment on the left, Electrical segment on the right. You can see the different pieces of the pie here. Starting with electrical distribution. They've been in the [ really ] two quarters now of managing their inventories relative to the backlog. And we think that's normalizing quickly and expecting a healthy mid-single-digit growth rate there, transmission, substation in distribution automation, which is up around noon on the pie. We think those are both high single digits meters and gas in the mid-single digits and Gerben talked about telecom, having a very cautious outlook waiting for orders to restart there. I will just comment, that's a short-term outlook. We do have very attractive medium- and long-term outlook for telecom. So the result on the utility side is a mid-single-digit growth rate. On the electrical, you see nets out at 3% to 4%, so low to mid. I think the industrial outlook, you see both light and heavy is low to mid-single digits. We have mid-single-digit growth rates in our verticals. And I think non-res we maybe have a bit of caution at flat to low single digits. So a constructive market outlook for 2024, and let's go to Page 11 and see how that rolls through our earnings outlook.\nSo you see the organic of 3% to 5% in our sales growth, combined with 5% net from M&A, one going out, one coming in to create 8% to 10% sales growth. That generates a 10% growth in operating profit. Results in 6% earnings and free cash flow at about 90% of net income affording a continued increase in CapEx. And let's just walk through the bridge to give you a feel for it. So we're under contract to sell residential lighting that will lose $20 million of OP, systems control, EIG and [ Bolestrone ] will be adding about $90 million. So you can see almost $1 coming from those before we pay the interest expense, which we have over on the right. We had for organic 3% to 5%, so we've comprised that of 2% to 4% volume and 1 point of price, which is in the next column, that's providing a nice list, and we have continued investment, particularly on the Electrical segment side, as we compete collectively there and continue to consolidate the footprint under our restructuring program. You see on the far right below OP, an increase in interest expense as a result of the borrowings that we outlined to close on systems control. And the result is about 6% earnings growth to the midpoint of [ 16 - 25]. You see some modeling considerations listed there.\nAnd I might just add another one on seasonality for those of you who are modeling, we're anticipating 2024 being quite normal seasonality for the first and fourth quarters being a little bit below the second and third quarters, which are seasonally stronger. And that just compares to last year where the first quarter was very strong in contributing to the full year. So we think a very constructive year in front of us. We feel well positioned, we're happy to have the return in volumes, and we're happy to have made some portfolio net addition to continue to push profitable growth at Hubbell. And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Gerb.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill. And before we turn it over to Q&A, I think it's helpful on the last page to look at our 2023 performance and '24 outlook in a longer-term context. The results we delivered for shareholders, not only in 2023, but over the last few years have been very strong. Most notably, we have doubled our adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share over a 3-year period. While growing sales at double-digit bigger and expanded adjusted operating margins from the mid-teens to over 20%. We have also doubled our capital expenditures over the last 3 years to further differentiate our service levels to customers and support attractive long-term growth expectations. As grid modernization and electrification drives the need for more reliable, resilient and renewable energy infrastructure, Hubbell is uniquely positioned with the right people, solutions and strategy to meet the evolving needs of our customers and deliver continued value to our shareholders.\nI'm extremely proud of our over 18,000 employees whose hard work and dedication have enabled us to achieve a new baseline of performance. And I am confident that we will build off of this success with continued attractive profitable growth in '24 and beyond. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day later this year on June 4, where we will provide more details on our long-term strategy with updated financial targets. With that, let's turn the call over to Q&A.",

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To remove yourself from the question queue, you may press star one one again. I would now like to hand the call over to VP of Investor Relations Dan Innamorato. Please, go ahead.\n\nDan Innamorato\n\nSenior Director Investor Relations, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter of 2023. The press release and slides are posted to the investors section of our website at hubble.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman President and CEO, Gerben Bakker and our executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to expected future results of our company and are forward looking statements, as defined by the private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nTherefore, please note the discussion of forward looking statements in our press release and consider it incorporated by reference into this call. Additionally comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release and slides. Now let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nThanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's third quarter results. Third quarter results demonstrate continued execution off of strong first half and multiyear performance. Price realization remains strong as prior actions to offset inflation continue to stick in the marketplace, supported by our leading position and service levels in attractive markets.\nAdditionally, improved productivity and lower year-over-year raw material costs also contributed to another quarter of significant operating margin expansion. As anticipated, we accelerated our investments in capacity, productivity and innovation initiatives in the third quarter to drive long term returns for shareholders.\nWe expect that grid modernization and electrification will continue to drive GDP plus growth in our markets over the next several years, and Hubbell is uniquely positioned to solve these critical infrastructure needs for our customers in front and behind the meter. These investments we are making in the second half of this year will effectively position the company to capitalize on these visible growth opportunities through best-in-class quality and service, as well as through the introduction of new products and solutions.\nMore near term, we detailed last quarter how normalizing supply chain dynamics have enabled improved manufacturing lead times and allowed our channel partners to normalize their order patterns in response to more predictable product availability.\nThis process continued into third quarter. Bill will walk you through more of the details in a few minutes. But overall, we continue to view this as a natural outcome of supply chain normalization. Broadly, our sell through to end markets remains healthy and our positions with our customers remain strong. We anticipate that we will be mostly through this normalization process as we exit 2023.\nOur visibility to continued strong operating performance gives us the confidence that we can navigate effectively through the fourth quarter to deliver at the upper half of our prior guidance range. As we look ahead to 2024, we believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth off of a strong multiyear performance base, and I will share some more color around our early planning considerations for next year at the end of the prepared remarks.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bill, Hubbell announced in a press release yesterday the acquisition of Systems Control for US$1.1 billion. And you'll note in today's presentation materials that we've also closed on a bolt-on acquisition of Balestro. Both of these acquisitions are high quality businesses with strong strategic fits that enhance our industry leading platform of utility components, communications and controls. Systems Control is a leading manufacturer of mission critical substation protection and control solutions.\nThe business is complementary to our portfolio and enhances our leading value proposition to our core utility customer base. Substation automation is an attractive space within the utility market as control and relay solutions are critical to upgrading and protecting aged infrastructure, while also enabling the integration of renewables and the electrification of the grid.\nSystems Control has a proven business model and a demonstrated track record of delivering value for customers and financial performance that will enhance Hubbell's long term growth and margin profile. Balestro is a leading manufacturer of high quality utility arresters and insulators that bolts on well to our existing portfolio. Importantly, this acquisition also provides us with additional manufacturing capacity that will enable incremental output in a constrained US T&D market.\nBill will provide more color on both of these acquisitions in a few minutes, but we are very pleased to deploy capital to acquire attractive businesses like these that will drive strong returns and strong long-term value for our customers and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to walk you through the details of the quarter.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Gerben. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you taking time to join us this morning. I'm going to start my comments on Page 4 of the materials that I hope you found on the website. And you'll see here highlighted strong results for the third quarter with our performance broadly consistent with the themes and trends we've been discussing throughout the year.\nIf I were to try to summarize that neatly in a sentence, I would say we've been enjoying broad based market strength in our key end markets, which has helped support strong margin expansion, primarily driven by execution on the price cost front and doing that while absorbing the channel, managing inventories down in response to the supply chain improving from pandemic depths.\nAnd you'll hear us talk about, I think, a lot of those themes throughout the day, as we discuss our performance with you. So, you see sales of about US$1.4 billion, a 5% increase, 4% organic, 1% from acquisition. And again, that's basically in line with how we've been guiding you. The OP margins at 21.4% plus 440 basis points for last year, marking the third quarter in 2023 where we've had margins above 20%, again, very strong execution particularly on the price lever there.\nAnd I'd say that we - it gave us the extra margin to help invest that we think will really help us both grow in future years, as well as be more efficient. So, I think as we think about earnings and profit essentially in line with our expectations, a little bit stronger on margin, maybe a little bit lighter on sales growth.\nSo, maybe getting there a little bit differently, but certainly in line with our expectations. You see, US$3.95 of earnings, 28% year-over-year increase, obviously, the strong operating performance driving those results. And free cash flow of US$159 million higher income in the quarter but also higher CapEx, higher investment in trade working capital. And we are confident in the year getting to US$700 million, so, fourth quarter is a very seasonally strong, as it typically is.\nSo, I think the way we were thinking about cash flow in Gerben's comments, he talked about multiyear trends. So, we're talking about cash flow from '21 to '22 to '23, going from US$425 million to US$500 million to US$700 million. And we're excited about the high quality earnings giving us that cash flow, because it allows us to lean into investing and making our great company even better in the future.\nLet's go to Page 5 and we'll see performance graphically a rate against prior year here. And I'm going to start in the upper left on sales, you see 5% increase to just under US$1.4 billion. We had talked about organic being 4%, acquisitions being 1%. The acquisitions, PCX, our data center acquisition as now we've kind of lapped out of that.\nSo, the incremental is coming from both EIG and Ripley, which were component manufacturers in the utility space, so, helping drive utility growth there mostly. On the organic 4%, price was 6% and units were down 2%. As we think about the units, there was two soft end markets that we're managing through. One is the resi side, where we've had double digit declines, I think interest rates having a big effect there.\nAnd second is on the telecom side, and we can talk a little bit more about that where we still have very strong medium-term outlook expectations for telecom. But to balance where we see units being driven down, we believe is coming from channel actions to manage their inventories in a very natural response to this kind of multiyear cycle of having our lead times gap out during pandemic problems where we had both material and labor shortages.\nWe forced our customers, therefore, to over-order and now they're managing that inventory back down to target at normal levels, meaning they're selling through to our end market at a higher rate than they're buying from us. And as Gerben said, we're starting to see that come to an end on the electrical side around now and we're expecting the power side to be done by year end.\nSo, I think '24 should start to look like a much more normal order pattern year for us with healthy markets. On the upper right, you see operating profit US$295 million for the quarter, 21.4% OP margin, 31% increase in dollars and a very healthy increase in basis points of margin expansion. Interestingly, as we look at trajectory and we see sequentially those margins are down versus the second quarter, that's primarily due to investments that we're making, essentially on the growth side, where we're pushing hard on new product development, innovation and also making some capacity expansions, as well as on the efficiency side, where we're focusing on sourcing. I think we've shared with you in the past pie charts of our cost structure and a lot of our cost in the material side.\nSo, our sourcing actually has to be very efficient and, as well as supply chain efficiency. So, we're happy to have the margin to make these investments, because we think they're going to make us more profitable in the future as we go forward. And earnings per share on the lower left, you see a US$0.28 increase to US$3.95, basically in line with OP growth. We had some tax headwinds that were largely offset by interest income.\nSo, one of the interesting impacts of higher interest rates where we have significant cash balances, we've been earning about 5% on that cash and even better, more towards 5.5% in the U.S. So help offset that tax headwind to keep keep earnings growth in line. And then you see the free cash flow down 18% to prior year. We obviously had more income but we have higher CapEx, higher working capital investment in inventory.\nBut one big driver was the timing of receipts, which flooded in, in early October. And so, October has proved to be a very cash rich month, we think going to drive a very cash rich fourth quarter, which will get us over US$700 million of cash flow for the year. So again, that three year walking cash really supporting us being able to be in a net investment position.\nSo, now I want to unpack the results between our two segments. And on Page 6, I wanted to start with the Utility segment. So, another strong quarter for our utility franchise, you see 8% growth in sales and nearly 40% growth in OP dollars with 5 points of operating profit margin expansion. So, strong performance by the franchise here. We'll focus on sales first, up 8% to US$838 million.\n7 points of that is organic, 1 being via acquisition. The organic is essentially all price, so units effectively flat. And interesting, we're starting to really see - we report to you in these two different business units between the components for transmission and distribution versus the comms and controls business unit. And we're starting to see the portfolio effect here where for the past couple of years, the T&D components business has been outgrowing communications and controls.\nLast quarter, the growth was quite balanced. In this quarter, you see comps and controls outgrowing components. I think both effects being driven effectively by supply chain disruption becoming more normalized, and let's talk through that for a minute. So, on the T&D side, we'll talk about three components: first, transmission; second, distribution; and third, telecom.\nThe transmission part of the business continues to be very strong, demand strong, shipment growth strong, backlog strong, pricing strong. On the distribution side, there are elements that continue to be quite strong on backlog and growth. In particular, there's places where there's some part shortages and in particular, some of these MOV blocks, which we'll talk about a little bit later that are causing some of the insulator arrester units to have just be growth constrained essentially.\nBut where the book-and-bill parts of distribution have come back and lead times have come way back, we're seeing again our channel managed the inventory down in some of those parts and the distribution portion bigger than transmission. Telecom is clearly weakening temporarily here.\nWe make primarily in closures, a little bit of connectors and hardware as well, but we make plastic, fiberglass and palmer concreting enclosures. If you're crossing the street and you look down as you're pushing the crosswalk button, you'll often see on those corners a lid and our brand would say, Quazite, you might see the brand name of the telco. And those are boxes that contain the electronics, keep them safe and dry and accessible for maintenance.\nAnd Telecom had become an important customer of that - of the Enclosures business and we see very clear weakening there by the telcos. I think there's a mix of high interest rates but we're seeing the timing of their projects being affected by stimulus dollars where if they wait to start a project into next year, they'll receive some stimulus and have someone else pay for it.\nSo, we're seeing that have pretty significant demand on the timing of projects. The medium term outlook for that spending is still very robust. So, we still consider a growth vertical but having this stimulus impacted, I think, weakness. So, that's up in T&D. On the comp side, similarly affected differently by the supply chain disruption, basically have been prevented from finalizing chips and AMI going into meters and so, business has been constrained.\nWe've seen the chip supply loosen up here in the third quarter and a nice nearly 30% growth at attractive margins. And so, we see some momentum now coming on the comp side. So, basically, the portfolio, the pieces and cylinders of our portfolio are firing at different times here, but the net result is a very strong performance, especially as you look over on the operating profit side on the right side of the page, nearly 40% growth to US$200 million of profit at 24% margins.\nPrice costs, still a quite a positive dynamic. We feel good about that, that the price continues to stick. The cost has all of '22, was inflationary from a materials perspective and '23 actually turned to become a tailwind. So, providing an awful lot of lift to that margin story and some momentum into our fourth quarter that gives us confidence, as Gerben mentioned, to raise our guidance for the fourth quarter. So, again, utility franchise performing really nicely, great financial performance.\nAnd we'll go to Page 7 to talk about the Electrical segment. And for them, quite strong execution on the operating profit line by Electrical Solution segments. You see the 17% growth and the attractive margin expansion there. All accomplished with a 1% decline in sales to US$538 million, a 1% decline is comprised of price being up low single digits and the volume being down mid single digits.\nAnd so, we're sort of talking about the different end market pieces there. And before breaking it down, I think important to note that the volume is up sequentially and we think that's a very good sign. You've heard me talk about the channel managing. The inventory is down that's most notable in our nonres exposure area. And with that volume up sequentially and as we see the order patterns emerging, we believe the fourth quarter will see the segment be able to grow.\nAnd we'd be able to discuss the end of the channel inventory management phase, which would be quite welcome. On the resi side, it's been soft, down double digits. The industrial is the brighter part. We see growth and healthy shipments. The reshoring tailwind, we think is real. And in particular, our verticals are doing very nicely between data centers and renewables.\nAnd so, when we look to the right side of the page, we see the margin expansion. We see the growth of OP dollars while absorbing some of the volume impacts of the channel inventory management phase and soft resi. It's actually we think quite a successful story. But Gerben, in his opening comments mentioned a couple of portfolio moves and on Page 8, I want to walk you through a little bit more detail than he gave you in his remarks.\nThis is really the outcome of our business development process, which is very intentional and focused on finding us high growth, high margin profile businesses that we can acquire and make more valuable on our platform than they are as stand-alone companies. And we believe we have two really good instances that that I'll talk you through and really good to see the cash flow performance of the enterprise, really enable us to comfortably do, not only two acquisitions, but one being in the US$1 billion kind of size range.\nSo, that's good. I'm going to start at the bottom of the page with Balestro. See Balestro, an US$85 million deal with US$40 million of sales that I think looks very typical to you all. I would call it a very typical Hubbell tuck-in. We've been in contact with them on for many years. It's exciting to get this to fruition. Balestro has a very attractive local business in Latin America, making insulated arrester products.\nBut the real attraction for us is what you see on the left of the picture, those little hockey pucks are MOV blocks. They help take insulator arrester products, which you see kind of in the spine there and prevents the conduction of electricity, which then allows our products to really protect other expensive equipment from the high voltage surges and other damaging effects.\nSo, effectively, our insulator arrester business in the U.S has been constrained by lack of availability of these MOV blocks. And so, it's an exciting deal for us to size of local business to really help us now get that supply chain vertically integrated, make more capacity available so we can actually grow and grab share in those businesses, which are high margin businesses.\nSo, very strategic acquisition for us even though of typical tuck-in sort of size. Systems control being a larger size than typical for us. On this page, I may talk about the footprint of systems control and next page, I'll maybe switch to a little bit more what it does. But you see US$1.1 billion of acquisition size with US$400 million of sales, that's all in backlog essentially.\nSo, it's kind of prewired for that for next year. We are anticipating closing. We've just signed it. We're anticipating closing by year end, as normal closing conditions get satisfied. We will be anticipating source of funds for the acquisition coming from cash and debt. As a result of the acquisition, we're anticipating our debt to EBITDA being around 1.7 times on a gross basis and net basis about 1.5. So, interesting to see how the balance sheet has grown and the cash flow has grown to allow US$1 billion deal to be very affordable by leverage means.\nWe're anticipating attractive accretion from the acquisition, it may be worth noting, I think a couple of you put out some notes that were emphasizing synergies. And I would not describe systems control as a synergy oriented deal, at least on the cost side, there certainly will be cost synergies, but there's always in the first year integration costs as well.\nSo, the net of that doesn't tend to be a big impact, but the real synergy for us is with our sales force and our client base really being able to grow the business very effectively. And as well, I think the second item on interest expense, we mentioned our cash. We've been earning about 5 points and borrowing will probably be in the 6s, but that's all subject to market conditions at the time of close.\nSo, we'll kind of reserve the time to get that organized for when we give you guidance, we'll give you more specifics on all of that. And maybe on Page 9, I can do a better job of explaining exactly what systems control is and what it does. So, you see on the bottom of the page, when you have generation, you got to step up the voltage to transmit it on one of those 90-foot steel towers.\nAnd when it gets to the last mile, it gets stepped down in voltage and then distributed to the user. And each of these substations around it's fun if you drive on the highway, you'll now start to look, I hope and see these white buildings inside of the substation, which contain these control and relay panels, which monitor and control the flow of electricity and prevent damage to any of the really expensive equipment around it.\nAnd so, this business kind of fits very nicely with Hubbell, in many ways. It's all the same customers. In fact, you're getting relationship oriented customers who like this product done on a turnkey basis, which is good for us. If you look around that substation on the upper left, we're already selling insulators, arresters, switches, bushings, hardware, connectors and the like, sprinkled around.\nSo, this is now kind of a chunky investment here in the control building. It has the same traits as typical level power systems where the cost of our product is quite low, relative to the investment in the performance and the other equipment around it. So, the protection of that becomes very valuable. It's going to involve very close work with our customers in designing and executing these buildings. So, we're very pleased and I think it fits well. Its financial history has been very attractive.\nIt's grown at double digits over the last eight years or so. The investment thesis on growth is really simple here. This outlook for substation spending is very robust as the 53,000 substations out there start to age. And secondly, the way these buildings are constructed, we think there's going to be a pivot from in-field construction to in factory construction.\nAnd this turnkey solution at systems control provides - fits that trend. We think both of those trends are going to allow for continued double digit growth at high margins. So, I think the last part of fit worth mentioning is the management team. Brad and his team, we really enjoyed getting to know them. We think a lot of times with private equity owned businesses we run into - a mercenary has been hired to address something up and sell it and Brad is 22-year vet at this company, he has a deep passion to grow it. And I would say, we're really excited to partner and provide Hubbell’s resources to enable Brad to engage in the growth strategy, and we welcome Brad and his team to the Hubbell family.\nSo, let's talk about how the year is expected to finish and then I'll let Gerben tell you about how that sets up '24. But on Page 10, you'll see that we had sales growth when we talked to you last in July of 8% to 10%. We're narrowing that to the 8% range. In July, we had earnings at 14.75 to 15.25, so, we're cutting that range in half and we feel good that the fourth quarter momentum will get us to the upper half of the range that we had initially shared with you back then. And the cash flow, really robust at US$700 million.\nSo, the fourth quarter is always left obviously. And we think what we should expect in our fourth quarter is typical seasonality, and there's mid single digit fewer days. So, we usually get that impact on sales sequentially. The price cost dynamic, we've got momentum there, which is going to help drive margin expansion in the fourth quarter.\nAnd we're going to continue to invest in both our businesses growth prospects as well as its efficiency to set up a stronger '24 and beyond. So, again, I think the three year walk shows a pretty interesting picture of the pandemic contraction in '20, the expansion with supply chain disruption in '21 and '22, and '23 being normalizing supply chains and price cost really driving this 25% growth over that three year period.\nSo we really feel we're coming out of the pandemic as a bigger, stronger, more profitable enterprise and I think we're pleased with the investing we've been able to do in '23 to really help support '24 and beyond. I'll let Gerben sort of give you some of his preliminary thoughts on that.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And as we look ahead, we feel well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Grid modernization, electrification megatrends remain intact and we continue to believe our utility markets can deliver mid single digit organic growth over the next several years. Our industry leading utility franchise is uniquely positioned to enable us to serve our utility customers as they invest to make the grid infrastructure more reliable, resilient and renewable.\nWhile we anticipate telecom markets to remain weak through the first half of next year, strong demand in T&D markets, particularly transmission and substation support visible growth. We also anticipate that the deployment of infrastructure stimulus funding will drive further demand for Hubbell Utility Solutions in the second half of next year.\nIn Electrical Solutions, we continue to see significant opportunity to drive further value across the portfolio by competing collectively and operating more efficiently as we bring these businesses closer together. We've made good progress in reshaping this portfolio over the last several years with 25% of segment revenues now tied to growth verticals aligned to mega trends like data centers, renewables and utility T&D and we expect continued growth in these areas next year.\nIndustrial markets have been solid with support from U.S industrial nearshoring and manufacturing project activity and nonresidential markets have remained stable. We've yet to see the signs of macroeconomic uncertainty or higher interest rate impact in these markets, but this is something we are closely monitoring as we build out contingency scenarios for planning into next year.\nFrom an operational perspective, the price/cost productivity equation will be more dynamic to navigate as we enter a more normalized environment, but we have levers at our disposal to manage this effectively. We expect that execution and productivity initiative will become a more important focus area for us moving forward to enable us to offset persisting inflation while maintaining the strong pricing levels we have achieved over the last several years. We'll provide additional color along with our '24 outlook early next year, but overall, we remain confident in our ability to deliver continued profitable growth off of a strong multiyear base of performance. With that, let me turn it over to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To remove yourself from the queue, you may press star one one again. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\n\nJeffrey Todd Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nThank you good morning. First, just thinking about Q4 implied kind of a nice acceleration in organic growth. Obviously, the comp is easier. But I just wonder if you could give us a sense of how you see volume progressing in Q4? It sounds like you would expect it to inflect positive in EP and backing into probably a decent volume quarter in utility also. But would love your perspective on just some granularity on the organic as Part 1 here?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nJeff, I think you almost answered your own question, but it is significant to us that the electrical side has been facing some of this overstock situation for a few quarters now. So, we think that’s nice to see that inflecting into a growth position and sort of getting that period back to a normal book and bill sort of fourth quarter and really ’24, and I think that’s that’s kind of the story.\n\nJeffrey Todd Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nAnd then, just thinking about margins into next year, Bill or Gerben, obviously, we’re coming off a high level. So, it sounds like you expect price to be positive. You still have inflation in aggregate, maybe not so much in materials. But maybe just kind of talk about roughly how you would bridge us on an incremental or however you want to frame it, because we’re also trying to dial in these investment headwinds?\nI would assume you’re going to continue to invest for growth going forward, but it sounds like maybe it’s a headwind in 2023, but is more kind of maybe just in the base than part of sales growth in 2024. But maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how to think about bridging the margins.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nI think, frankly, we’ll be much more, give you much more granularity when we’re together in January, and we give you our guidance. But I think you’re putting your finger on some important things. Basically, you’ve got the expectation that volumes will be positive. And in those cases, it’s the fixed cost absorption and the incrementals helping push margins up.\nI think the investment point, we’re still calibrating exactly how much we’re going to do. I think, from Gerben’s and my perspective, the great news is to see how creative and aggressive our teams have been in coming up with investment ideas. So, it’s more a function of Gerben and I regulating that and as opposed to, gee, we don’t have any ideas as to how to improve the franchise.\nI think on the price comment that you made, there is a little bit of wrap around embedded from the timing of price increases in ’23, but that’s pretty small, certainly compared to the last two years. And will be whether there’s any new price beyond that will remain to be seen, and we’ll share that with you as we get to year end. I think we do expect productivity because you mentioned the inflation side and we’ve been pretty simplistically trying to maintain a balance between price and material cost on one hand and productivity and nonmaterial inflation on the other.\nWhen a nonmaterial inflation gets 5%-ish , right, it’s a little bit harder to rely on just productivity to do that. That being said, we have a lot of this investment that we’ve been talking about is aligned towards being more productive.  So, we’re going to continue to target that price/cost productivity to be balanced. But again, I think we’ll be a lot more clear with you and granular with you, Jeff, when we’re together next time.\n\nJeffrey Todd Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nAnd maybe just a quick one for Gerben. Nice deal here, obviously, on the utility side. I just wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on how you can leverage it internally, either for growth or margin expansion? And what kind of — Bill kind of tried to dial us back a little bit on cost synergies. I’m sure there are some, though, like how do you integrate this into your footprint, leverage purchasing, that sort of thing to fully maximize the value here?\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nYeah, sure. And we’re obviously very excited to bug deals, but obviously, the systems control, the size and the scale that it adds to the franchise we’re really excited about. The good news with this business coming in that it’s historically been high growth and it’s very profitable, as you can see. So, that’s certainly a nice position coming into the portfolio. As we look and we diligence this business there’s some really nice trends that I think will serve this business right.\nOne is that they’ve been for 60 year a relining control panel manufacturing, but over the last 10 or 20 years, they’ve moved into more turnkey systems. And in essence, what that does is take labor of putting these systems together traditionally in the field to a more controlled environment in the factory where they can not only have a better control environment, they test them and it takes a lot of time out of the field.\nSo, this is a trend that we’re actually seeing in the business started when we acquired PCX, that similar dynamics, some of the new products that we’re developing have those features in place. So, it’s an area that we believe will see outsized growth coming in. What we can add to it is, we looked at who their customers are, it aligns extremely well with where some of our customers are with the exception that they still have a much smaller share of those customers.\nAnd I think this is where we really see that with our sales or with our people, we can add to complementing that. So, I do believe it’s more about the sales growth than probably typical cost synergies that we would see smaller tuck-ins coming in, but really excited about having this in the portfolio on what we can do with it.\n\nJeffrey Todd Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line - Please standby. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\n\nC. Stephen Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. So, just on the - can you update us on the price cost productivity numbers? And then Bill, you always have like a pretty good balanced view of the macro here. I remember back in the day, you would talk about how things were either kind of trending as you would expect with a rhythm to it or whether things were kind of choppy in a low growth world. How would you kind of characterize the demand you’re seeing today into ’24, like just from a consistency and visibility perspective across your portfolio?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nI would say the hard part about your question is, I think you’re asking about out the door demand from our channel to the end user, and I think that has been a nice stable demand. I’d point out two weak areas between telco and resi. And together, they’re each on 1 side of our segment and they’re each about 10%. So, there’s 80% of the company, I would say, Steve, that’s seeing nice, healthy markets from the out the door sales side. I think the part that makes it a little more challenging is how much of that’s coming out of inventory in the channel versus how much is coming out of our factory shipping new stuff. And that’s where we’re sort of in this inflection phase that I think our electrical side was probably a quarter earlier.\nAnd so, I think they’re out of it and our power side has another quarter or so to go. And so, that disconnect is just makes it a little less smooth. And I think from a - I think you’re using a good word of predictability and visibility, I think we’re looking forward to ’24 being a little more straightforward of, if demand gets an order to get a shipment.\n\nC. Stephen Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nAnd then is price cost and productivity for the year, like what that new number is, if there’s an update to it [inaudible] yes, price cost productivity.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nYes. So, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, this is kind of - we got this eight quarter ’22 and ’23 very positive picture. ’22, I would characterize as really strong price pull with material inflation. ’23 has been a little bit less price pulled but with material tailwind. So, it created an even bigger net. And as you look at it quarterly, it’s stepping down in the second half. So, third and fourth quarter, a little bit less, but still I mean, on an absolute basis, a really big contributor to our margin expansion story.\n\nC. Stephen Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nCan you get an absolute number?\n\nDan Innamorato\n\nSenior Director Investor Relations, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nDriving the majority of the margin expansion, Steve.\n\nC. Stephen Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nOk, great. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would like to remind analysts to limit your questions to one question and one follow up. Again, that's one question and one follow up, then return to the queue. Please standby for our next question, which comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys. So, we only get one question and one follow up, ok. Can you just maybe just give us kind of your thinking on what gives you confidence that this utility destock is sort of going to be finished by year end, because I think that’s the key for a lot of folks here, so, any metrics on kind of selling the sellouts, backlog burn or days on hand, any intel there would be helpful?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nSo, we’ve been using backlog, Nigel, let’s say that to simplify your question, Electrical is already in the position of being kind of book and bill, okay? So, we’ve used backlog in the second and third quarters of this year, and we still have more backlog than we traditionally do. I would say, pre-pandemic, we would think about backlog being in the six week range as being very normal and typical of our book-and-bill kind of enterprise.\nI’d say we’re sort of in the quarter and half of backlog now, so, it’s maybe 2.5 times typical size. So, we still have the backlog on the power side. And I think that the models that we’ve built and the way that we’re looking at those specific businesses who have gone to a much more normal lead time and we see those are the areas where we think they’re shipping more than they’re receiving from us.\nAs we talk to our customers and the models that we’ve created, it feels to us like that burns off, that whole phase burns off by the end of the year. And we’re kind of using what we saw in Electrical because that’s a good precursor, we think. And so those, all that stuff combines but I do appreciate I think there’s maybe some art and some science mixed together in that answer.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nAnd maybe I’ll provide an additional comment here, Nigel, is that while I think Bill correctly points out, there’s a lot of moving parts. The good part is we have very strong tie-ins with not just our electrical channel partners, but with our utility and customers. So, through those discussions, we can have discussion where the inventory sits in that channel because it sits in both places. And we see clearly in certain product lines, supported by the order rate and the shipment rates that the inventories come down, and they’re telling us when they’re getting towards that end of where they want to be.\nBut I’ll also remind you that the demand in the utility sector is still very, very strong. And in those same conversations, customers are very optimistic about the increased higher levels of spend. If you look at our CapEx plans going forward, elevated. So, while certainly a little bit uncomfortable managing through this time, as we look out a little bit, we feel really good about the end demand and that we can continue to grow our business through the cycle.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nOkay. That's helpful, thanks.  And then, just on the Electrical Solutions margins, I think, with all this noise in the utility, I think we’re forgetting that these are continuing to like inflate to record levels, especially when we consider the residential business would be obviously well below that the average. So, when volumes inflect, I think you’re calling for volume to reflect in the fourth quarter and then obviously into 2024. Do you think you can actually build on these margins or is there going to be some offsets that I can’t think of any, but are you confident you can push margins into maybe the [inaudible] levels?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nYes. I think you’re looking at it the same way we are, which is that this is a new base and that new volumes should drop at incrementals. And I think the one overlay to all that, that gives me maybe even more confidence than you is Mark Mikes spent seems like a lifetime making our Power Systems multi-brand platform compete collectively and act really efficiently.\nAnd he really is at the early days of him adding what I would just call overall segment efficiencies to how those different silos are running. And so, there’s both the math of growth and incrementals but also Mark’s experience with us and track record of finding just structural ways to make it cheaper to operate and more efficiently, I should say.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nOkay. Thanks, Bill.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey of Mizuho.\n\nBrett Logan Linzey\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nHey, good morning, all.  I wanted to come back to comm and controls up 28% and other strong quarters you catch up on supply chain. I know at one point, you had a US$1 billion backlog, US$6 billion of pipeline of projects in the funnel. Just curious what the conversion of that funnel has been looking like? And then, do you think you can build off some of this catch-up growth this year as we flip the calendar ’24?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nLet me start with the first one - or, sorry, the second one, I’ll let Gerben comment maybe on the overall picture. But yes, we think the momentum of having the chip supplies saw is really helping us get some backlog from the meter side out and as well on the AMI side. So, it’s a welcome surge of momentum that certainly will carry us through fourth quarter, Brett, maybe I’ll let Gerben talk back really about the positioning.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nAnd now, regarding the backlog, it still sits around that US$1 billion-ish mark. As we look forward, especially with some of the technologies that we are developing to serve some of those new applications of distribution, automation, we feel well positioned in this market over the next several years out, and we see it in our quotation activity that’s picking up. These are big projects that timing of which tends to be a little more unpredictable than the regular stock and flow part of our business. But we’re quite optimistic and bullish about what this business can contribute over the next few years.\n\nBrett Logan Linzey\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nThat's helpful, thanks. And then, just a follow-up, I think you noted the additional manufacturing capacity, the two recent deals could be favorable. I guess, how does this change your current capacity plans or what you’re thinking in terms of ’24 budgeting? And can you absorb some of the acquired capacity, any context there?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nI think on the Balestro side, it’s really adding to the capacity of our North American insulator arrester business. I think on the systems control side, as I was mentioning, Brad has some ambitious growth plans that we really embrace, so, I think we’ll be looking to add capacity. As we mentioned, they’ve been growing double digits for eight years in a row, and so we’re looking to help buttress that.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nAnd I’d say, on the kind of specific to Balestro, helps with the investment needs even into next year because that was one of the areas we were contemplating having them make investments in to grow that block or this capacity, but it’s not the only one why not constraints in other areas. If you look at our transmission business and other parts of the businesses, we clearly still need to invest into next year to be able to capture that growth over the next few years. It helps but it’s not unique.\n\nBrett Logan Linzey\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nUnderstood. Thanks for the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS. Please, go ahead Chris.\n\nChristopher M. Snyder\n\nResearch Associate, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI wanted to just ask about confidence and the ability to hold utility margins at around these levels into next year. Obviously, up a lot year-on-year, and it felt like a big piece of that expansion was obviously on price cost. So, kind of just talk about expectations there into next year.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nMaybe I’ll start, and Bill will fill in. And if you look at the margins, particularly to the utility, but I think it’s across our business that in ’23 we are looking to expand our margins there by 700 basis points, that’s quite attractive. And our view is going into ’24 is that we can grow profitably on that base. And one of the drivers is going to be volume next year. We do expect that business to grow in volume.\nWe expect to manage through this price cost productivity equation that we talked about earlier and we’ll continue to invest in the business. So, I think as a set up to think of profitable growth on top of this base is the right way in the experience. And certainly, we’ll come back in January to provide more color on the different moving pieces and where that may fall with margins more specifically.\n\nChristopher M. Snyder\n\nResearch Associate, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI appreciate that. And then, maybe just on the price side of utility. It seems like, obviously, there’s been a lot of price the past couple of years. It seemed like the drivers of that was obviously metal - raw materials inflating higher? And then also just supply couldn’t keep up with the strong demand, but now with deflation and it seems like some supplies in a better place, allowing the channel to destock. Any change around price push back in the channel?\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nI would say on the utility, we’re not seeing it. And you mentioned a couple of things that caused the price, but I’d say beyond metals, just general inflation we’ve seen over the last year, just incredible nonmaterial inflation. And I think we talked in the past of what the pure commodities is and it’s actually a relatively small part of it. The bigger part is the purchase components, the labor and all that has inflated pretty well.\nThe other thing that we continue to have discussions with our customer around is the investments that we’re making back in our business. And you don’t always see that reflected in our operating performance or EPS, but the level of CapEx and the elevation that we’ve done in CapEx and other areas is an area that clearly benefits our customers short term and long term. So, I think much more of the discussion continues to be around the value that we can add by the product and the services that we deliver than price first as a lever, not unimportant but it’s not the leading part of the discussion.\n\nChristopher M. Snyder\n\nResearch Associate, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI appreciate that, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe O'dea of Wells Fargo.\n\nJoseph John O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nHi, good morning. First question, I just wanted to ask if you’re seeing higher funding costs factor in the conversations with utilities and their spend plans at all in your sort of comments around ongoing mid single digit growth, doesn’t really seem like it. And then just related to that, I think your kind of outlook for the transmission and substation growth to outpace distribution growth, maybe a little bit more context on sort of what’s behind in driving that.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.",
    "content2": "I think, let me take the second question first. Transmission and substation growth, I think is being impacted quite a bit by renewables as well as electrification trends. So, you need a new substation if you’re doing a utility size solar farm that needs to be generated and then transmitted and then step down again, to the extent you had some kind of massive data center or battery factory, so, electrification impacts like that.\nThat kind of increases the demand on substations. And in addition, you just have those 53,000 substations, you just have some aging equipment that needs to be updated. So, it’s not that that distribution has bad growth outlook. It’s just that the projects on the T and substation side, we just think are going to outgrow a little bit.\nWe did a little deep dive last quarter on that, because we think it’s an interesting little subset of the space. As far as interest rate impact on project management, I think, it obviously is weighing on people’s consideration of cost of capital. And I just think the returns on their projects are just higher than the cost of capital. So, we just haven’t seen the dialog step down because of interest rates but that means - I don’t know, we’re not - we just haven’t seen that yet.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nAnd the other thing that will help is the infrastructure bills that are starting to come out. We’re seeing some of those being released right now. We just recently saw money being released in those areas. A good bit of those are going into transmission projects that we’ve been following. So that gives us confidence that certainly over the more near term, that area is a little stronger. But possibly, even to your interest rate question, I think bodes well for us going into next year, particularly the second half.\n\nJoseph John O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nThat's helpful. And then, just on the sequential margin trends in utility. I think clearly a mix impact with the comms and control strength within the power side and anything from a mix side there to be mindful of, in terms of the sequential move, or was it really just the comps and controls mix?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nYes, I would say nothing inside of Power Systems would create sequential issues.\n\nJoseph John O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nGot it. Thanks very much.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joseph.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dan Innamorato for closing remarks. Sir?\n\nDan Innamorato\n\nSenior Director Investor Relations, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we’ll be around all day for calls. Thank you.\n\nGerben Bakker\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Hubbell Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter of 2023. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company. are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and consider it incorporated by reference in this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures that are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's second quarter '23 results. Hubbell delivered another strong quarter of financial results. Our favorable position in attractive markets enabled us to achieve 6% organic growth, which combined with improved productivity and supply chain dynamics to drive significant and margin expansion in the quarter. Solid execution through the first half of 2023 and good visibility to continued strength in our businesses give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook again this morning.\nIn addition to the strong financial results, we continue to improve our service levels to customers. Hubbell's investments in capacity, innovation and supply chain resiliency are enabling increased sequential output and improved lead times. Looking ahead, we expect grid modernization and electrification to continue to drive elevated demand for Hubbell's critical infrastructure solutions both in front and behind the meter. We will continue to make the investments into our business to support this growth in the second half of '23 and beyond.\nBefore I turn it over to Bill to give you more insight on the performance in the quarter, I would like to introduce our 2 new segment presidents. You will recall from our press release a few weeks ago, that we announced Allan Connelly's retirement from Hubbell after 10 years of leading Aclara and, in recent years, our combined Utility Solutions segment. Allan's strategic vision and passion for innovation played a critical role in accelerating the segment's organic growth profile, and I'd like to thank him for his many contributions to Hubbell as well as strong financial performance for our shareholders.\nI'm excited to share that we've appointed a very talented successor in Greg Gumbs to lead Hubbell Utility Solutions moving forward. Greg has a strong track record of leadership and performance in the utility, electrical and automation industries over his career, and his skill set is well suited to help us further our growth ambitions across Utility Components, Communications & Controls. I've gotten to know Greg over the past year and believe he will integrate quickly and effectively within the organization. This focus will be on driving profitable growth by building on a strong core foundation while innovating and expanding in attractive adjacencies.\nI'm also excited to announce the appointment of Mark Mikes to lead Hubbell Electrical Solutions. Mark is a long-tenured Hubbell leader with a proven track record of performance and operational execution, most recently in leading Hubbell Power Systems. The strong results of that business over the last several years speaks for itself. Some of you will know Mark from our Investor Days over the past few years, and he was a key partner to me when I led the Utility business. He played a critical leadership role in our efforts to unify a broad portfolio of acquired utility businesses under an integrated business in Power Systems, organized to compete collectively with a simplified operating structure. As we continue our multiyear journey to execute a similar playbook in HDS, Mark is well suited to drive sustained improvement in the segment's long-term growth and margin profile.\nBoth Greg and Mark are well supported by experienced and talented leadership teams, and I am confident they will continue to execute on our core strategy together and deliver consistently differentiated performance for our customers and shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it to Bill here to walk you through the financial performance in the quarter.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Gerben, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Congratulations to Greg and Mark. And on a personal note for me, very, very excited to partner with both of you as we drive to future success with Hubbell. They're both off to excellent starts in their new responsibilities.\nI'm going to start my comments on Page 5 of the materials that you hopefully grabbed. It's really just a summary. A very strong financial performance in the second quarter. Most of the compares we'll show you in this deck are against the second quarter of prior year of 2022. We find it instructive also to look sequentially to the first quarter of '23, and I think that we see a lot of continuation of the positive trends that we experienced in Q1. And things played out quite similarly in the second quarter, so a 6% sequential top line growth and 1.5 points or so, so a margin added. So a lot of the same themes that you'll remember from our first quarter call.\nYou see sales at $1 billion with 79% growth, with 3% coming from acquisitions, 6% organic, the organic being driven primarily by price, which is a theme again you guys saw first quarter with us and going back to last year. OP margin, reaching the 22% level, a very attractive level, nearly 6-point improvement over last year, really a result of the price/cost being favorable as well as some productivity from the supply chain normalization of some of the efficiencies coming with that. Earnings per share above the $4 level. Also very attractive, 45% growth rate, that increase in earnings resulting -- being driven by the sales growth and the margin expansion at the OP level.\nFree cash flow of $192 million, really driven by the strong net income growth. And that number is absorbing continued investment in CapEx and working capital. So I think that we're very pleased with this cash flow. It's allowed us to strengthen the balance sheet. If you look at the balance sheet at the midway point here of 2023, you've got nearly $0.5 billion of cash, about $1.4 billion of long-term debt. So our net debt to EBITDA being less than 1, we think really positions our balance sheet to be supportive of being an investment profile. And we think that can come both in the form of CapEx, OpEx as well as acquisition.\nAnd on the acquisition front, very pleased to announce in the second quarter we were able to close our acquisition of Electro Industries, a very typical Hubbell-size bolt-on of $60 million. It fits into the utility segment. products are in the distribution automation area of sensing and controls, power quality, metering, fits very well with other products of ours in that space. So we welcome our new associates from Electro to the Hubbell family.\nI'm going to switch now to Page 6, which lays out our performance in this bar chart format, and we'll drill a little bit into each item. So the sales growth of 9%. We said 3% acquisitions, 6% organic. The organic is really all price. Volumes were down slightly overall as electrical volumes were down and partially offset by the growth in utility volumes. We'll talk about each segment and subsequent pages a little bit more.\nThe acquisitions from 3 points came from 2 major contributors, 1 from each segment, and I think a good reflection of our intentional investment strategy. On the Electrical side, contribution comes from PCX, which was a data center acquisition we made. We just passed our first anniversary of owning PCX, off to a great start, growth and margin-wise. On the Power Systems side, Ripley Tools, very good extension on the component side for us for Power Systems. So again, good signals of how we intend to deploy our capital here.\nOn the upper right, you see operating profit up 47% and above the 22% level. Price cost, really the biggest driver there. And interestingly, both levers contributing to the margin expansion. I think you've seen our price story play out over the last couple of years or so. But also this quarter, we had material cost flipping to a tailwind, so actual deflation in both the raws and our component costs there, helping drive strong margins. We believe our pricing success has been driven by our differentiated service levels. We get consistent feedback from our customers that we're outperforming competitors in that regard. And that continues to inform us, as we continue to invest, we want to push that differentiated performance and make sure we're able to support those pricing levels and continue to make our margins durable and truly emerge from the pandemic as a more profitable company.\nBesides price cost, there also was productivity. I think we're finding that our factories are performing better in '23 than in '22. Really as supply chains normalizing, we're getting a lot of those inefficiencies we experienced last year to be ironed out, and that's helping drive margins for us. We don't think they're all the way back but certainly a contributor. On lower left, you have earnings per share. Again, the $4 level and a 45% increase, really all operating profit driven. Below the line was a slight drag as taxes were up just a little bit, but that was partially offset by a decline in interest expense, really net interest expenses. Our cash, I mentioned we're up to close to $500 million, and that cash is actually starting to earn interest income to help offset the expense.\nOn the lower right, you see free cash flow. This page depicts the 3 months of the second quarter, up 14% to $192 million. I find a little more instructive to widen the lens and talk about the first 6 months, where we've got $272 million of free cash flow, which is more than a doubling of what it was last year. And that's been absorbing a higher CapEx level or CapEx for the first 6 months of the year. It's up about 2/3 from what it was last year to almost $70 million in the first half as well as an increase in working capital investment as we continue to need the inventory to support our customer service. So I think given the fact that we're investing and increasing the cash flow shows a good relationship there.\nLet's unpack the performance by segment. And on Page 7, we'll start with Utility. Utility has really been the engine of the Hubbell enterprise financial performance of late. We think really a leading business model, unique positioning across components, communications and controls and very worthy of continued investment, as we'll discuss a little bit more later. So on the sales side, see 14% increase to $831 million. That's comprised of 1 point from acquisition, I mentioned Ripley Tools before, and 13% organic. That organic is comprised of roughly double-digit price and low single-digit volume increase. And we believe we've got really nice end market demand construct here, and it's really complemented across the 2 segments we're talking about here, the 2 business units between the transmission distribution components growing at 13% and the comms and controls growing at mid-teens.\nThat comms and controls piece is the Aclara, largely the Aclara business. I think most of you following it will remember they've been held back by a shortage of chips over the last 1.5 years or so. And as we saw easing of that chip supply in the second quarter, and for us, we got our comms business out of the gates first. And they had a really strong second quarter. We see because of their supply now, they had a nice backlog of demand from their customers and with the supply chain improving on the chip side, we see a very good second half for the comps. That happens to be a nice -- a very attractive gross margin business, so a very mix-friendly development. And the meter side, we see exiting the quarter with the same kind of supply trend. So we think meters will have a good second half visibility as well. So I think good news to see the comms half kind of returning to not being held back by supply constraints.\nAnd on the Power Systems side, you've seen that over the recent quarters really having strong growth. I think you'll remember last quarter, we showed you a chart that had a 3-year review of orders and shipments. And that chart essentially showed a relentless buildup of backlog over that time frame that was starting to peak at the end of that period. And as we discussed then, the orders were reflecting, yes, strong demand. But they are also reacting to the shortage of supply and the need of our customers to be ordering farther ahead in order to keep themselves stocked. That obviously was not sustainable, and especially in light of improving supply chain and shortening of promised delivery dates.\nAs we've seen those lead times start to normalize, I would say, in 2 particular segments of the components area, we've really started to see customers adjust their order pattern to reflect the fact that they can work off of inventory and can moderate their order pattern until that inventory gets to the proper levels. So that's both the distribution side of Power Systems as well as the telecom end market. Both of those have very attractive backlogs. So we'll be navigating a period of using the backlog as those order patterns adjust, and as Gerben had mentioned, in raising our guidance we feel that we've got the momentum to clearly carry us through the second half of the year.\nAnd on the right side of the page, you see the operating profit story. Just a very impressive performance of 70% increase north of 25% margins. Really good price cost there, improved productivity. The factories are getting rid of some of those prior year inefficiencies. I mentioned the mix with Aclara has been quite favorable. And we are investing on the OpEx side as well as the CapEx side. And we anticipate increasing those investments in the second half, and we'll talk a little bit about that on the next page.\nSo Page 8, we wanted to highlight for you the transition space. And this is kind of defined more narrowly. As transmission, we often lump in substation here, but this is kind of the more narrow transmission piece, smaller than the distribution side of the components world, But nonetheless, a really critical area to enable the grid modernization, hardening electrification and really getting renewable generation to the point where the user is. And so we think the trends here are very attractive. We see long-term growth rates in the high single-digit range. Right now, we're seeing -- in contrast to what I described in telco and distribution, we're seeing orders and quotes up over 50% over prior year. We think there's some support here from stimulus packages, from government policy where IRA is helping spurred development through the provision of the tax credits versus the IIJA providing harder funding dollars to really spend on the project.\nSo we think really nice growth dynamics in the area. We also think that we are really well positioned. We feel we have the best depth and breadth of products, quality and reliability. We also feel helping the problem-solving and design area plays to Hubbell's strengths. And ultimately, to help with the complexity of getting material to these projects, I think there's a tendency to want fewer suppliers. So that plays very well to our positioning. So we feel very well positioned in very effective markets such that we'll get our fair share and at the point where that's going to require investment on our part to help support our customers. The graph is of the total Hubbell enterprise CapEx, but you see over a couple of years, a very strong increase in that capital. On the Electrical side, going a little bit more to productivity. And on the Utility side, I'd say, it's tending more to the growth side. And I'd say the distribution part of utility was earning the early CapEx raises. And now we're starting to shift our focus onto T. And you'll see we've put a little plus sign to the right of the [ 160 ]. As those dynamics play out over the second half of the year, I don't think we would shy away from investing even more if the dynamics require it.\nWe think we are -- so we have attractive growth. We're well positioned and we're prepared to invest to earn more than our fair share. As we map out these projects, they have excellent ROI when you just analyze the financials. But I also think, it's a really good way for us to continue to differentiate our customer service and solutions that we provide to our customers, which ultimately helps support the sustainability of our utility margins to last just beyond a big quarter. So that kind of underlies one of our rationales for continuing to want to support our customers in a differentiated way.\nPage 9 is the Electrical segment. And you can see a 1% growth year-over-year to $535 million. That's also a 6% sequential growth, so a little bit better than typical seasonality there. The acquisition of PCX that I had talked about added 5 points. So the organic is actually down 4%, and that included a mid-single digit of price. From a markets perspective, the industrial end markets showing a strong demand, I think the reshoring trend is providing strength in U.S. manufacturing, oil and gas, steel and transportation, all being strong contributors to growth for us. The verticals that we focused on between data centers and renewables, we've been very successful growing there. And the more commercial arena, we're seeing similar, as I described in the power systems, where the D and the telecom customers were starting to adjust their order patterns.\nWe've seen that in our Electrical segment on the -- more on the commercial side, and the customer anecdotes are suggesting that their days of inventory are getting in line with targets they have. And therefore, we may be -- we think nearer to the end of that adjustment period. And our expectation is second half will be a little more balanced between book and bill.\nAnd on the OP side on the right, you see an improvement of 12% growth. It's obviously not the volume that's driving it. The price cost has been very positive and the productivity has been good right there. And I think it sort of points out where Mark is going to be focused with us as he takes over this segment. He was incredibly successful on the power side, bringing together multiple brands and multiple acquisitions to compete collectively as a business. And I think he'll be able to help us do the same inside of the Electrical segment. And we'll continue to support Mark in acquiring higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. We're going to be focused on innovation where new product development should come in at higher margins and the vertical focus can help us pull a lot of balance of system product into high-growth areas and continue to focus on that productivity and try to, again, make those margins durable as we go forward.\nSo those are the -- that's the financial performance in the 2 segments, and I'll give it back to Gerben to share with you how that is our outlook as we stand here at the halfway point.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill. And moving to our outlook. Hubbell is raising our 2023 outlook to an adjusted earnings per share range of $14.75 to $15.25, representing approximately 40% adjusted earnings growth for the year at the midpoint. We continue to project total sales growth in the range of 8% to 10% with 7% to 9% organic growth. Our improved outlook is primarily driven by improved visibility to second half margin performance as we expect to sustain favorable price cost and continue to drive productivity across our businesses.\nWe're also accelerating our investment levels in the second half to increase capacity for future demand in areas with visible longer-term growth, drive higher productivity, accelerate innovation and enhance supply chain resiliency. These investments position us to execute effectively across each of our strategic pillars, which are to serve our customers, grow the enterprise, operate with discipline and develop our people. I'm confident that our strategy will continue to deliver strong results for our stakeholders in the second half of '23 and beyond.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Dan Innamorato, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2023. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com.\nI'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference to this call.\nAdditionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's first quarter 2023 results.\nHubble is off to a strong start to the year. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, driven primarily by 3 factors: stronger stick rates and realization on incremental price actions, effective ramp-up of recent capacity investments and improved operational productivity. We are raising our full year outlook this morning to account for this outperformance while maintaining a balanced view of risks and opportunities as we navigate a more uncertain second half.\nOur investments in capacity, innovation and productivity are yielding strong returns and enabling us to effectively serve strong customer demand for Hubbell's critical infrastructure solutions. Most notably, utilities continue to actively harden and upgrade aging infrastructure while also investing to facilitate renewables and electrification through new interconnections and enhanced smart grid applications.\nWe achieved double-digit sales growth in the first quarter as improved production output enabled continued volume growth while leading service levels supported continued demand strength and price realization. Operationally, we achieved over 600 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter, driven by favorable price cost and productivity in addition to volume growth.\nWhile Utility Solutions continued to perform exceptionally well in a strong market environment, we are also very pleased with the operating performance of Electrical Solutions, which achieved strong margin expansion in a more modest market backdrop. We're executing well in our strategy to compete collectively as a unified HUS operating segment, and we'll talk more about that later.\nBefore I turn it over to Bill to give you more details on the financial performance in the quarter, I want to highlight a few recent accomplishments which demonstrate that our strategy and the investments we are making into our business are driving value for all our key stakeholders.\nFirst, Hubbell Power Systems and Burndy are proud to have been named Supplier of the Year by 2 of our largest electrical distributors in 2022, with strong demand and tight supply chains in the utility T&D and industrial markets, delivering on commitments to get customers the product they need when they need it while maintaining consistent quality, reliability and service is critically important. While the supply chain environment remains challenging, our ability to execute and our willingness to invest in production capacity and working capital has helped strengthen our long-term relationships with major customers.\nIn our electrical segment, we're also pleased to have been recognized with Product of the Year award by major trade publication for 2 innovative product launches. EdgeConnect screwless termination wiring devices is a product line we launched last year which innovate on a 100-year-old product design, eliminating the need for installation tools and delivering 80% labor savings for installers.\nBurndy's Quickshear bolt is a new product for solar and wind markets, which eliminates the need for compression tooling and manual torque wrenches, simplifying conductor installation and saving the contractor time in the field.\nThese are just a couple of examples of the investments we are making into innovation to accelerate Hubbell's organic growth profile in core markets as well as strategic growth verticals.\nAnd finally, for the third consecutive year, Hubbell was named 1 of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a distinction that recognizes all of our employees for their dedication in upholding our core values each and every day.\nOne aspect of those core values is our commitment to sustainability, and as many of you will have seen, in March, we released our annual sustainability report with refreshed multiyear goals to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and hazardous waste by 2030. These new goals supercede our initial 2025 goals, which we achieved ahead of schedule.\nSustainability is a core component of our business strategy, not just in our own manufacturing and operations, but through the impact of our products in making critical infrastructure safer, more reliable and more efficient. We continue to accelerate our investments in areas like T&D infrastructure, renewables, utility automation, electric vehicles and broadband communications, each of which offer attractive growth opportunities for our shareholders while enabling Hubbell to further its mission to energize and electrify our economy and our communities in front and behind the meter.\nNow let me turn it over to Bill to give you some more details on our performance.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gerb, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate your interest in Hubbell. I wanted to start by reminding us when we were together in January talking about our full year outlook. We established a couple of important components of a framework of that outlook.\nFirst was that we were confident in our end markets that they would outgrow GDP, a function of some of the key electrification megatrends. We were confident that we were well positioned in those end markets with brands and solutions and people processing technology to continue to satisfy and service the customer. We felt that our pricing, which is in response to a couple of year impact of some inflation, had us set up well for 2023 with a couple of points of wraparound. And we also stated that our visibility to the first half was better than the second half, and so it's important for us to get off to a good start and we were trying to be explicit that we had a front half-loaded outlook as a result of that second half uncertainty.\nAnd as Gerben had said, my comments, I'm starting on Page 5 of the materials, we exceeded our expectations significantly in the quarter. You see sales of $1.29 billion, 11% growth, was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in sales for us. I think pretty good indication of solid demand out there. Right now that demand is notably skewed towards the utility side of our business versus the electrical, and we'll talk a little bit more about that as we unpack the results.\nOP margin of 20.7%. That 20% level, kind of a milestone achievement for us and really driven by some of the price cost drivers that -- and productivity that Gerben had mentioned.\nEarnings, up 70% to $3.61, nearly $1.50 almost of new earnings generated versus the prior year period end.\nCash flow, this is typically a seasonal low for us at the very beginning, first quarter, but a nice amount of cash being generated because of the income that we generated.\nSo on Page 6, let's drill down a layer into that strong performance. Starting in the upper left with sales, the 11% growth is comprised of high single-digit price increase and low single-digit volume increase. The volume varied by segment where it was quite flat in electrical and very strong growth in utility.\nThe OP on the upper right, you see an increase to $267 million of OP, a 66% increase over the prior year. And again, at that 20% benchmark level.\nEarnings per share grew just a little bit more than the operating profit, driven obviously by that profit, but also taxes were just slightly lower this period. And on the net interest expense line, we have our interest cost in the form of our bonds are fixed versus the cash we have earns variable rates. And with rates rising, we earn more income, so reduced the net interest expense. So you got a little bit favorability below the line and inside of earnings.\nAnd the cash flow there, you can see the compare to last year. Right above it you see the amount of income becoming more cash flow. And quite important for us to have the cash to leave us in a position where we're poised to support our investment. We are keen to continue to increase CapEx. We think there's excellent growth opportunities for us on the utility side and continues to be good productivity opportunity on the electrical side as well as to have more capital to support investing in acquisitions, and we'll talk about a couple of the acquisitions we've done and how they're doing since we've brought them on.\nLet's unpack those results by segment, and you'll see different profile here as we go through. Utility right now is the engine driving the Hubbell enterprise. We find ourselves with a very constructive set of market dynamics, coupled with a really excellent positioning and a best-in-class leading franchise that we've constructed over the decades here with components communications and controls, really from the backbone to the edge, and a really, really strong franchise that's performing really well in these market conditions.\nSo starting with sales, the 20% growth in sales to $782 million is comprised roughly half from price increase and half from volume gains. The volume was skewed more towards the transmission and distribution component side versus the comms and control side. We feel that the CapEx that we've been investing to add capacity has allowed us to grow sequentially and year-over-year, and that's been really helpful. I think besides helping us grow, it's helped us manage service levels. And the feedback we keep getting from customers is that service level is beating that of the competition. And I think those service levels in turn are reinforcing our value proposition and help us support a pricing environment as well as, we believe, leading to some share gains on the volume side.\nOn the Communications & Controls, you see 4% growth there. You'll recall that through much of last year, that was bumping along flat. And so we may be starting to see a little bit of buying in the supply of chips, allowing those meters to get built and installed. And we're looking forward to more of that as we go forward.\nOn the operating profit side, 87% growth to $191 million. You see almost $90 million of new profit generated by the segment. Just a really impressive financial performance for them.\nYou have lots of things going right. You have price and material being positive. On the pricing side, that's a multi-quarter trend that you all have seen. On the material side, actually a little bit new to see that there was actually some tailwind that came from materials as opposed to we had been facing inflation all of last year on that side. So both of those contributing tailwinds, which, as you see, pushed up margins impressively.\nThe volume that we enjoyed dropped through at attractive incrementals, that helps push the margin up. And we've been talking to you about the impact of disrupted supply chains on -- impairing our productivity last year. And we're seeing some return to normalcy in some of those dimensions where that productivity is starting to come back and be positive. So a lot of drivers really helping lift the margin and propel the results of the utility segment.\nWe thought it would be helpful on Page 8 to maybe give a multiyear view of how the demand pattern has looked, and we've shared with you here a picture of the backlog. And what you can see is starting really at the beginning of 2021, a very significant and sustained increase in the backlog on the utility side of distribution and transmission components. It's obviously driven by the fact that the demand exceeded our ability to be able to make and ship a like amount of material.\nAnd one of the reasons we wanted to show you the page is we feel that, that level of demand is not the norm and would not be a sustainable level over the long time. Essentially, I think we see their pattern was responding to longer lead times and the fact that we were in an increasing price environment, both of those phenomena, I think, caused people to put their orders in earlier than they otherwise might, and that's evidenced and supported by the fact that there's quite a bit of content in this backlog that's dated longer than 90 days.\nAnd so what we expect is that as we start to get the supply chain normalized, get our lead times normalized and bring those factors down, we think we'll be enabling our customers to get their orders put in with the anticipation that get the material much faster. And so our anticipation is that the order rate can come down and we'll be reducing this backlog to get it back into balance and what we feel over the medium and long term is a mid-single-digit sustainable book-and-bill order and ship rate.\nAnd so we really wanted to show you this page. It's part of what gives us the conviction to raise our guidance that Gerben mentioned at the top. We think this momentum, you start to create visibility through the better part of this year. And so it gave us the confidence that we could give you that increase in guidance.\nOn Page 9, we switch to the electrical segment. And you'll see very strong profit performance, an increase of 30% to 15% margins, $76 million of OP on flat sales. That sales includes an acquisition of PCX which, just to remind you, was a very intentional increase in our exposure to the data center space. That business is based down in Raleigh. And Gerben and I and some of our partners had the opportunity to go visit the team last week in Raleigh, and it's great to see them fly in the Hubble flag at their facility and see how excited they are to be part of the Hubbell family and the greater resources that we have which they believe is going to enable them to be a more capable competitor. So welcome those folks to our family.\nThe counter is that the organic part of electrical was down a little bit. We saw softness in residential at the double-digit level. We had strength in our industrial markets and notably some of the verticals we've been calling out in renewables and data center and telecom.\nAnd I think one way [indiscernible] like this, besides the compare to prior year is to also look at the sequential trend in demand and sales. And typical seasonality for us is to have the fourth quarter lead to a slight decline in the first quarter of a couple of points. That would be typical seasonal progression. And the fact that it's flat this year is a favorable compared to that typical season and leads us to believe that demand is in fairly healthy shape there.\nBut I think more impressive for us on the electrical side was the margin performance and, similar to utility, very good price material performance, same improved productivity where the plants are becoming more efficient after dealing with some of the inefficiencies forced on them by the pandemic.\nWe also thought on Page 10 it would be worthwhile to show you how we are building around some of these identified verticals. And you'll remember at Investor Day, and Gerben mentioned in his comments, we're trying to compete collectively in the electrical segment. And at Investor Day, we shared some of the benefits of transitioning from a 3 vertical silo segment to a single segment. We think there's efficiency gains but also, importantly, effectiveness gains. This is an example of the ability to be more effective.\nSo we organize around the renewable, in this example, the renewable vertical. And again, to remind you, so this is solar and wind applications. We're not making solar panels. We're not making wind turbines. Our approach is around the balance of system of components that those applications require. And those balance of systems can come from different business units across our electrical segment. So the trick is to get the sales force to be very effective at cross-selling, to get the marketing team focused on helping to solve customer problems, to get the capital flowing toward new product development that can come out of that improved voice of customer that the newly organized sales force get. And Gerben mentioned a couple of these products, but good examples of us being able to serve a vertical more capably when we compete collectively as an electrical segment.\nWe thought it noteworthy to show you that in just 3 years, at the bottom, we've been able to double our performance in the vertical to about $100 million of exposure, and we anticipate similar amount of growth as we move forward. I think also think of this as a model of other verticals that we're intending to become more vertically oriented around, including data centers, telecom and electric vehicles, all of which we're using similar techniques to become better and more effective.\nSo how does this performance and all that we're doing, how does it compare to what we said when we were together in January and where does it take us as we look out? And to us, important for us to share with you, where do we see improvement, where do we see things the same and what is still uncertain.\nAnd on the improvement side, it clearly starts with the pricing actions. So actions that we were contemplating at the end of the year and implemented in the new year had stick rates far above historical averages and far above our expectations. I think it's an example of the channel really endorsing and embracing these pricing actions, and that created a big improvement.\nAdditionally, you recall, our CapEx has gone from about $100 million to the ballpark of $130 million last year. We're anticipating taking it up to $160 million this year. Those big improvements in CapEx are paying off and our ability to ship more volume.\nAnd certainly, the productivity that was impaired a little bit last year by our labor being not available on a consistent basis, materials not being available on a consistent basis and transportation, likewise, not being available on a consistent basis made it very difficult to plan and execute inside our plants. And we're seeing those conditions improve and we're seeing, as a result, productivity improvement. So all of that is causing us to raise our sales and margin outlook.\nWhat's the same is utility demand and the market strength, we see continuing. We showed you evidence of that order pattern in the backlog page. The electrical markets continue to trend. And as we said, having a favorable compare sequentially to the fourth quarter we think is a good sign of demand. And we still believe that we have a significant part of the portfolio is going to show resistance to consumer-led recession effects that includes both utility side transition and distribution components, but it also includes elements on the electrical side, where both industrial and some of those verticals inside renewable telecom and data centers we expect to grow through any macro.\nBut on the uncertain side on the right, we still have uncertainty in the second half. We think we see good momentum to the second quarter which gives us some confidence. We still are working through channel inventory levels and making sure that what our customers have on the shelves is aligned with what they know they can move and making sure they have the confidence to keep putting orders in with us to sell through.\nI think the nonres end markets, whether they're impacted by any macro uncertainty, again, we don't see signs of that yet. But we read the papers just like you all and know there are concerns out there. So that's causing us to have some conservatism as we think about the second half. In other words, our guidance that Gerben is about to talk through is not the first quarter seasonally extrapolated through the year. It involves good momentum into the second and then some caution around the second half.\nSo I'll turn it to Gerben to quantify our outlook for you.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident & COO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill, for those additional insights on our results.\nHubble is raising our 2023 outlook to an adjusted earnings per share range of $13 to $13.50, representing approximately 25% adjusted earnings growth at the midpoint. This outlook now assumes 8% to 10% total sales growth and 7% to 9% organic growth for the full year consisting of approximately equal contributions from price realization and volume growth.\nWe continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%. This updated outlook incorporates a continuation of strong fundamental performance from the first quarter while also maintaining a balanced view of risks and opportunities. It also enables us to accelerate our investment levels to support high-return capacity, footprint and innovation projects over the balance of 2023.\nWe believe this balanced view should enable us to achieve our outlook in a range of macroeconomic scenarios. Not only is this updated outlook well ahead of our expectations coming into 2023, but it also puts us on the path to achieve our 2025 targets which we laid out for you during Investor Day last summer, 2 years ahead of schedule, all while accelerating investments back into our business and without substantial benefit from capital allocations.\nI am proud of our employees for the results that they are driving for our customers and shareholders, and we remain committed to delivering differentiated results over the near and long term.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 Hubbell Incorporated. Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Innamorato, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and consider it incorporated by reference into this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures that are included in the press release and slides.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. 2022 was a strong year for Hubbell. We effectively served our customers through a challenging operating environment, consistently delivering high-quality, critical infrastructure solutions, which enable grid modernization and electrification in front of and behind the meter.\nWe also delivered strong results for our shareholders with full year organic growth of 18%, adjusted operating profit growth of 29% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 32%.\nWe began 2022 by completing the divestiture of our C&I Lighting, successfully positioning the Hubbell portfolio for structurally higher long-term growth and margins.\nWe also stepped up our investment levels to bolster our positions in key strategic growth verticals through acquisitions and organic innovation, expanded our capacity in areas of visible long-term growth and to improve our manufacturing and distribution footprint for future productivity.\nImportantly, we've been able to fund these investments while still expanding operating margins, driven by strong execution on price/cost in the face of significant inflationary and supply chain pressures.\nOur employees have worked hard through a challenging environment to sustain a culture of excellence, delivering industry-leading service levels for our utility and electrical customers, along with differentiated financial operating performance. The critical contributions of our employees and partners is what has led to a highly successful 2022 for all of our key stakeholders.\nLooking ahead, we believe that Hubbell's unique leading position in attractive markets will enable us to continue delivering on each of these fronts in 2023 and beyond. We will talk more in depth on our near-term outlook later in this presentation, but we anticipate continued market growth and strong execution, driving positive price/cost productivity to fund investments back into our business, which will generate long-term value for our customers while delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.\nTurning to Page 4. Our fourth quarter results were generally consistent with year-to-date trends. Utility customers continue to invest in upgrading, hardening and modernizing aging grid infrastructure. Orders continued to outpace shipments, and we exited '22 with record backlog levels, which gives us good visibility to continued growth in 2023, though continued investment is required to address areas of capacity constraint.\nIn Electrical Solutions, orders and volumes softened in the fourth quarter as customers actively managed inventories and cash flow into year-end. These dynamics were anticipated and contemplated in the outlook we provided last October.\nOperationally, we expanded operating margins by over 200 basis points in the quarter. While the overall environment remains inflationary, easing raw material inflation and continued traction on price drove a net price/cost productivity benefit.\nFinally, we continue to accelerate our investment levels. Most notably, we invested over $60 million in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter as we're able to execute several large capacity and productivity projects.\nFor the full year, we invested just under $130 million in capital expenditures, up $40 million from '21 levels, and we expect another year of elevated CapEx in '23 as we believe that these high-return investments are the best current use of our shareholders' capital. So overall, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a strong year for Hubbell.\nLet me now turn it over to Bill to provide you some more details on our performance.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks very much, Gerben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Looking forward to talking about fourth quarter full year and in particular, our outlook for 2023.\nI'm going to start my comments on Page 5 of the materials that Dan referenced, and we'll start with the fourth quarter results for the Hubbell Enterprise. You see sales growth of 11%, up over $1.2 billion. That 11% is comprised of high single digits of price, low single digits of volume and 1 point from acquisition.\nWe look at our sales performance through a few different lenses here. The first is against prior year. This double-digit growth against double-digit growth in last year's fourth quarter shows good compounding and good robust levels of demand.\nWe also look at it through the lens of comparing it to the third quarter. We're down sequentially about 7%, roughly in line with fewer days and the per day shipment level reasonably flat to the third quarter sequentially.\nAnd we also believe that there were some -- the channel was managing their inventory levels, and we'll talk more about that in a couple of pages when we get to the Electrical segment.\nThe operating profit on the upper right of the page, very impressive growth of 27%, very healthy margin expansion of 2 points to 16%. And when we look at the incremental drop-through on the growth, you see about mid-30s drop-through, which we think is quite good.\nPrice is really a very important part of the success of this financial performance. The price is sticking Gerben made reference to the critical products and our customers adding to their structural solutions and having the sticking price is really helping us as inflation is continuing to affect us in the nonmaterial and value-added places. And when we talk about next year, we'll give you a little bit more breakdown about how we're anticipating price/costs.\nOn the lower left, you see earnings per share growing at 26%, in line with the profit growth. On the non-op side, we had some headwind from taxes as well as from pension. But Gerben had referenced that we started last year with the disposal of the C&I Lighting business. And we used some of the proceeds of that sale to buy back shares, which partially offset these non-op headwinds.\nThe free cash flow you see is down 9%. That more than explains the CapEx increase that Gerben described. So the OCF side here is quite healthy, and we're being quite intentional on making these investments in order to position Hubbell for the future to be successful.\nPage 6. We'll switch to breaking the fourth quarter down between our 2 segments, and Page 6 starts with the Utility segment. And you see a really strong finish to an outstanding year by our utility franchise set up for success for 2023.\nYou see total sales growth here of 17% to about $716 million of sales. That 17% of sales is comprised of a low double-digit increase in price and a mid-single-digit increase in volumes. Demand continues to be very robust. Despite high double-digit shipments here, we continued to add to the backlog in the fourth quarter.\nYou'll see that the T&D components, the historical Hubbell Power Systems infrastructure business, showing the most growth at 27%. The trends continue to be driven by the need for grid hardening and for renewables, and continues to reinforce the shift that we've seen from mere kind of GDP-type replacement levels of spending to the need for our customers to really upgrade the grid.\nAnd I think you'll see the evidence of our strong positioning as our utilities continue to turn to us with these critical needs and that's really helping inform and drive some of our CapEx decisions that Gerben had mentioned to continue to support our customers here.\nOn the Communications and Control side, you'll see a decrease of 10% in sales. While demand was still strong. There are 2 drivers to that contraction. Number one is the persistent shortage of chips from the supply chain that's really preventing us from growing, and that's been a persistent problem for the last few quarters and has kept our Communications and Controls business relatively flat.\nIn addition, we had a onetime event in the fourth quarter where we recognized the commercial resolution. This was stemming from a legacy dispute that preceded Hubbell's acquisition and it became obvious. It was time to resolve that so that we could move forward with a constructive relationship with a big customer and to our mutual benefit, we believe. But that had the impact of driving down sales in the quarter for the communications, control segment.\nWe expect this chip situation to improve during 2023. So while the quarter was down, we have expectations of the comms business growing that it may still be a little choppy in Q1, but we're anticipating getting this chip supply situation to improve during the course of the year, and we're looking forward to returning that business to growth.\nYou can see on the right side of the page, very impressive operating profit growth of 42%, adding 3 points to operating profit margin, up over 17% in the fourth quarter by the utility team, that performance being driven by price, which we've really needed to overcome inflation as well as inefficiencies in our plants that coming from some of the disruptions from the supply chain. The mid-single-digit volume growth is also dropping through at attractive levels. So really good year by our utility franchise, and you can see a good quarter setting us up for a good year next year.\nOn Page 7, we've got the Electrical Solutions results. And you'll see 3% sales growth, more modest than on the utility side, but a good 60 basis points margin expansion. 8% OP growth to a 14.3% margin. That 3% is comprised of mid-single digits price in volume compared unfavorably to last year. We think that the fourth quarter results significantly impacted by some of our mix. So you see residential sales down significantly. So strong double-digit decline for resi as consumers continue to struggle with high interest rates. And we saw some growth in some of the verticals we've been investing in, namely, data centers, renewables and telecom. And the balance being more exposed to the to the nonres cycle.\nAnd so, we also thought that we were able to perceive some destocking activity in the quarter. We've mentioned this before with you all. Some of that observation is based on anecdotes and discussions with our customers. In other places, we have hard data where we can analyze point-of-sale and point-of-purchase data and see that our replenishment orders given to us are below what's going out the door.\nWe believe that the way the channels incentives are structured, whether on the volume side, those incentives may have maxed out or on the cash flow side where obviously, managing inventories in December becomes very important to our customers.\nSo I think there's a little bit of distortion in the fourth quarter. As we've seen, the first several weeks of January, we've seen a nice rebound in orders. And so, we'll continue to watch that quite carefully, obviously.\nOn the operating profit side, you see the nice margin expansion. And again, price and material tailwind is enough to overcome the impact of lower volumes and enable us to operate very well through the operating disruptions but also overcoming some of the drag coming from the resi lighting business.\nWe thought it'd be constructive on Page 8 to step back and discuss the full year's performance and really illustrates some of the trends that Gerben highlighted in his opening remarks. Sales of 18%, very strong growth. Mid-single-digit volume and double-digit price, very robust demand environment for us. You see the 140 basis points of margin expansion to just under 16% on the OP side. 29% growth in OP.\nDiluted earnings per share growing a little bit better than in line with that operating profit, and the cash flow being up 20% year-over-year being held back a little bit with the heavy investment in CapEx that we had mentioned as well as significant investment in inventory as we continue to try to support our customer service.\nBut you really see the trends for the whole year that have persisted, strong demand, number one. Number two, a tough operating environment where the availability of our people, materials and transportation has been inconsistent throughout the year and leads to operating inefficiencies. Three is the execution on price, which was excellent job by the Hubbell team, really required to counter inflation as well as those inefficiencies. And the fourth trend was instrument, acquisitions, CapEx and inventory, all sources of investment.\nOn the acquisition side, we closed on 3 deals in the year. We invested about $180 million to do so. We were quite intentional about adding exposure to desirable verticals that are exhibiting higher growth and higher margin potential than our average. So we added to our utility tool business, we added data center exposure, and we added a nice bolt-on to our Burndy grounding business and connector business that, again, is supporting high growth, high margin there.\nSo we'll switch now from 2022, wrap a bow on that and start to look forward to '23 in our outlook. We were proposing to go through this a little bit differently than we have in the past. We've got a little more granularity in our discussion of the different pieces and parts so that we can help provide a little more context to why we're guiding the way we see it.\nSo on Page 10, we're starting with our markets outlook. And you'll see in the yellow call-out box at the bottom page, a mid-single-digit expectation of organic growth. And you'll see from -- that's driven really by the strength of the utility business on the left of the page. Those growth drivers remain intact.\nWe see our customers continuing to need material, continuing to install at a high rate in response to the need to modernize their grid and respond to renewable needs. We're starting the year with a highly visible backlog. And in addition, we've got some support for funding from the policy side here.\nAnd we've outlined a way where we believe that the IIJA probably gives us a lift of 1 point or 2 above what otherwise the markets would give us. So we're anticipating the utility markets giving us mid-single-digits plus.\nMore modest on the Electrical side, and we've decomposed our exposure in this pie graph here to try to give you a sense of residential, really, we think, is the starting point of the cycle there in a point of contraction right now. We'll continue to be in '23, we believe, consumers dealing with high mortgage rate, high interest rates affecting demand there.\nUsually nonres follows the resi cycle and then into industrial. And you see we've added this blue segment where we think our Electrical business is exposed in a much less cyclical, much more resilient set of end markets, namely, the data centers, renewables and telecom as well as some of the enclosures we sell as connectors to the utility businesses there.\nSo if we continue to believe resi will contract, that gives us a low single-digit outlook for the Electrical segment. Our visibility, frankly, is better to the first half than it is the second half, and we may even argue that the first quarter, better visibility than the first half. So we've got a little bit of caution built in there for what will happen second half in the nonres markets.\nWe also, on Page 11, wanted to peel back our view of price/cost productivity. And at the bottom, you'll see we're anticipating about $50 million of tailwind coming out of our price/cost productivity management scheme here. We'll start on the edges where it's a little bit more straightforward on price.\nWe believe we've got about 2 points wrapping around from our actions we've taken in '22, and we continue to hear feedback from our customers that despite on-time service being below where we typically are, that we're still leading in those service levels. And so, we anticipate that price sticking.\nOn the productivity side, we're anticipating in the ballpark of about 1 point of contribution from productivity. And this cost pie, you'll see we've disaggregated into 2 halves, the material and the nonmaterial half. On the right, in the blue section, the nonmaterial, mostly labor and manufacturing costs, we're anticipating mid-single-digit inflation there. Likewise, on the material side, you'll see that the raw materials, we're anticipating there to be benefits and tailwinds as there's deflation in the raws. But our component buy where there's value add is larger than that. And we're anticipating the same mid-single-digit inflation rate there. So the netting of all that gets us to about $50 million. And on Page 12, you'll see we're anticipating investing about half of that benefit in the future success.\nAnd so, Page 12 shows our investments starting with footprint and successful multiyear restructuring program that Hubbell has implemented where we spent about $17 million in 2022, which was an increase from $10 million in '21. So our margin performance absorbed extra expense in '22. We're anticipating to keep that flat in '23. So nothing incremental as far as the income statement is concerned, but still good activities with good projects that typically give us we find in that 3-year average payback range.\nAs for capacity, we continue to find in the utility side and parts of Electrical that we need to invest in our capacity. So we've got -- our CapEx has moved impressively from $90 million in '21 to about $130 million in '22. And we're anticipating this year up to about $150 million. And that ultimately result in about $15 million incremental operating expense that we would add another $10 million or so of innovation expense.\nAnd I know those of you who joined us for our Investor Day saw some of those innovation ideas, and we continue to be encouraged by early results, but for us to get impact still going to take us some time. But we've got a good business case of getting about 0.5 point of growth above our markets from those activities.\nSo those pieces we thought we'd give you the puts and takes and let Gerben on our last page kind of sum it out and net it out in our typical waterfall format that you're used to seeing.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And as you said, let me summarize it here on Page 3 (sic) [Page 13]. Hubbell is initiating our 2023 outlook with an adjusted earnings per share range of $11 to $11.50. We believe this represents strong fundamental operating performance for our shareholders, and we are well positioned to deliver on this outlook in a range of macroeconomic scenarios.\nFrom a sales standpoint, we expect solid mid-single-digit growth organically, driven by 2% to 4% of volume growth and approximately 2 points of price realization. We believe this is a balanced view with good visibility into utility demand and less certainty in electrical markets at this stage. We expect the 2022 acquisition of PCX, Ripley Tools and REF to add an additional 1% to '23 revenues.\nOperationally, we expect that continued execution on price/cost productivity will fund attractive high-return investments back into our business. Our outlook range embeds solid margin expansion with high single-digit to low double-digit adjusted operating profit growth. This operational growth rate is consistent with the long-term targets we provided at our Investor Day last June despite the current macroeconomic uncertainty, and a higher 2022 base following significant outperformance last year, and it puts us well on the path to achieve our 2025 targets.\nWe expect the strong operating performance to enable us to absorb below-the-line headwinds from pension expense and the previously communicated nonrepeat other income from the C&I Lighting divestiture. Overall, our 2023 outlook represents a continuation of the strong fundamental performance that Hubbell demonstrated in 2022.\nWith leading positions in attractive markets underpinned by grid modernization and electrification megatrends as well as a growing track record of consistent operational execution, I am confident that Hubbell is well positioned to continue in delivering differentiated results for our shareholders over the near and long term.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Q3 2022 Hubbell Inc. Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Innamorato. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter 2022 results. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com.\nI'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry. Please note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nTherefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference on this call.\nAdditionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's third quarter results.\nConsistent with the first half of 2022, our third quarter result was solid. Our markets are healthy, our positions in those markets are strong, and we continue to execute effectively from an operational standpoint.\nOur third quarter results exceeded our initial expectations and we are raising our full year outlook to reflect a continuation of those positive trends throughout 2022. We are well positioned in attractive markets that are supported by long-term trends in grid modernization and electrification, which continue to drive strong demand for our products.\nUtility customers are proactively replacing aging infrastructure while investing significantly to upgrade, harden and modernize the grid, driving another quarter of strong orders growth and backlog build.\nThe work that we have done to streamline our portfolio and the investments we are making in strategic growth verticals are positioning Hubbell for sustainable GDP plus growth as our economy becomes more electrified.\nFrom an operational standpoint, margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume growth and favorable price cost. We have been active in pricing to address significant material and nonmaterial inflation over the last 18 to 24 months.\nWhile general inflation persists throughout our supply chain we have now started to benefit from easing in the portion of our cost base that is tied directly to certain raw materials.\nWhile the operating environment remains dynamic, we are proud of the way our employees have continued to effectively navigate through supply chain uncertainty to deliver on our commitments to customers.\nAs we look to drive continued success on this front, I'm also excited to welcome Akshay Mittal to the senior leadership team as Hubbell's new operations leader. Akshay comes to Hubbell with an extensive operation and supply chain background across various industrial manufacturing industries, and we look forward to build on the strong foundation we have established while accelerating our efforts in footprint optimization, factory automation and supply chain resilience.\nTurning to Page 4. I would like to highlight a few of the key financial outputs of the themes we just talked about before letting Bill walk you through the results in more detail.\nIn the third quarter, we achieved organic growth of 20%, adjusted operating profit growth of 37%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 190 basis points, adjusted earnings per share growth of 45% and free cash flow of $194 million.\nThese results were driven by strong price realization and volumes, combined with easing material costs and effective operational execution. Overall, a very strong quarter for Hubbell and attractive results for our shareholders.\nI also want to turn to Page 5 and take a few minutes on 2 recent achievements which really highlights the strength of our franchise in the electric T&D market and the work we are doing to support critical infrastructure needs of our customers.\nThe first is our storm restoration efforts to Hurricane Ian and Fiona with our 24/7 Hubbell Emergency Action Team. Storms like these are unfortunate due to the impact on lives and community and they also put a lot of strain on utility customers to restore service and repair damaged lines.\nWe are proud to support our customers in these efforts through a dedicated team that prioritizes these requirements and gets our customers the needed expedited materials to enable successful and timely restoration of service. This is a unique differentiator for Hubbell as we can fully utilize our industry-leading sales force, depth and breadth of the product offering and operational capabilities to effectively serve our customers when they need it most.\nOur people truly distinguish themselves during these events which helps us forge long-lasting customer partnership based on quality, reliability and service. And on the topic of long-term customer relationship, we are also pleased to have been recently awarded the Annual Supplier of Choice award by one of the largest investor-owned utilities in the U.S. This award was given to Hubbell for our strong service, not only over the last decade, but through the more recent challenging supply chain environment as our industry-leading scale and the investment we've been able to make in our business have enabled us to effectively deliver on our commitments.\nWhile strong electric T&D market growth continues to be a key driver of our success, we also feel confident that we will continue to outperform these markets as we reinvest to first to bolster our position.\nWith that, let me now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the time to be with us. I also want to welcome Akshay to the team. I'm personally excited to partner with him. I think we can add a lot of value by ramping up our operational intensity. So looking forward to that.\nMy comments are going to start on Page 6 and really summarize the very strong financial quarter that Hubbell team turned in, in the third quarter of 2022. So on the upper left, we'll start with sales. You see an increase of 21% to just over $1.3 billion in sales. That -- 21% increase is comprised of 20% organic, 2% from M&A and 1 point of drag from FX.\nThe 20% organic is comprised of about a 13% price and approximately 7% volume. So actually, quite impressive contributions from both volume and price which will filter through all of our comments around our performance. And those are obviously comparisons to prior year.\nWe find it instructive to track sales on a sequential basis as well. And for sales to be up mid-single digits from the prior quarter where there's kind of equal contributions to that mid-single-digit growth sequentially from both price and volume. I think that's a pretty good sign that we may be seeing some modest easing in the supply chain.\nIn other words, I would say we were trying to operate at capacity in the second quarter, a function of a high backlog and the need to serve our customers who wanted our material and for us to be able to grow the volume part of that from second quarter to third quarter sequentially.\nI think there's a little bit of sign of easing across the availability of staffing, availability materials and transportation as well. So as we think about the demand underlying that sales growth, I would characterize it as broad-based growth both Electrical and Utility experiencing impressive growth and inside of the segments, quite a broad-based contribution to growth inside of each segment.\nOrders continue to outpace sales, and we are building backlog through the third quarter. That skews towards the Utility segment as our Electrical segment has a much more balanced book and bill feel to it now starting to get back in line and balance there, which I think is also good news as we track.\nSo on the upper right, you'll see operating profit. A growth of 37% and operating profit dollars to $224 million and nearly 2 points of margin expansion in the quarter. That margin expansion is really driven by price/cost favorability and that favorability is needed to overcome the other inflation as well as some of the inefficiencies that the supply chain disruptions are causing inside of our factories.\nThe results here indicate incremental drop-through in the mid-20s, and that maybe gives you a little bit of a feel for -- that's quite normal incremental. So if it was just price cost, favorability, I think we'd see better than mid-20s incremental. So you can see that we've really needed that price to help us overcome the nonmaterial inflation as well as the other inefficiencies.\nAnd then in the bottom left, you see the EPS quadrant, a 45% increase to $3.08 a share. And that roughly $0.95 increase in earnings year-over-year is largely driven by the improvement in operating profit, but there are also some below-the-line contributions.\nTax is quite comparable. We did some share repurchases with the proceeds from the sale of C&I Lighting and there was some slight non-op contribution as well. Free cash flow for the quarter, $194 million, extremely favorable comparison to last year.\nI think maybe more instructive to look at the year-to-date performance on cash flow, where we feel very good about where we stand relative to delivering on our full year promise, and we'll update you on our guidance slide as to how that's going. But we're making very purposeful and intentional investments in working capital, given the growth in demand.\nSo both receivables and inventory are requiring investment for us to satisfy our customers. We also are keen to invest in CapEx and the flavor of that CapEx difference by segment, we'll talk about in each segment. But it's skewed in Electrical, the CapEx investing towards productivity. On the Utility side, the CapEx is skewed towards expansion and capacity.\nSo a very strong performance. And I'd like to now unpack that by segment. On Page 7, let's start with the Utility Solutions segment and just a really strong quarter turned in by our Utility franchise performing extremely well in these market conditions. You can see sales increasing 29% and operating profit dollars up 53% with nearly 3 points of margin expansion. So very, very strong performance from the segment.\nLet's look at sales a little more closely. You see a 29% increase to $775 million. That's really mostly organic, small 1% contribution from acquisitions. I ordinarily would like to tell you a lot about the acquisitions. Ripley Tools is new to the portfolio, is performing extremely well, but you can see kind of pales in comparison to what's going on organically.\nAnd that organic performance, I would say, is comprised of volumes in the low double-digit range and price in the mid-teens range to get to that 28% organic. So very, very healthy market conditions there as well as a testament to our very, very strong positioning in those -- in this attractive market.\nThe growth is really skewed towards the T&D Components rather than towards the Comms & Controls. We had 38% growth from the T&D Components. Gerben highlighted the trends there, really have aging infrastructure that requires upgrades and hardening. We have -- the move towards renewables and that -- those new sources of generation need to be transmitted, need to be distributed and need to be integrated into the system and certainly modernizing with smarter and more controls, all of which being supported by some infrastructure legislation that I think is giving our customers the confidence that there's funding for their demand.\nThe Communications & Controls side, you see up a more modest 3% and that's really being skewed towards the automation controls area, which is up double digits as the Comms component still being constrained by the lack of chip availability. So while we see healthy demand, we're having a lot of trouble satisfying that demand.\nOn the operations side, I see a 50% improvement in operating profit dollars, very impressive performance to $144 million and the 3 points of margin expansion.\nPrice and material being a strong contributor, but let's not lose sight of the fact that we've got double-digit volume, and that provides obviously good operating leverage lift and incrementals. And at the same time, there are headwinds coming from nonmaterial inflation and just supply chain inefficiencies. But net-net, really strong contribution from our Utility segment.\nOn Page 8, we unpack the Electrical Solutions segment. Also strong performance, albeit not at the same high levels. But you see an impressive 12% growth to $542 million in sales. That's comprised of low single digits in unit volume and high single digit in price.\nSo I think you'll remember that our Electrical team started pulling price a little sooner than our Utility team and so see the Utility team experiencing higher price now as it came on a little bit later. The demand here is broad-based across various product lines and across various end markets.\nThe exception is the resi market, where we're experiencing double-digit contraction and thinking about order of magnitude, about 15% of the segment being down double digits, gives us a couple of points of drag in this segment from that resi market.\nBut some of the verticals, namely data centers, renewables and comms performing very well and the industrial markets also doing very well, both on the light and the heavy side. So again, broad-based support for that 12% growth ex resi.\nAnd on the right side, you see quite a nice improvement in operating profit of 15% to $80 million. You see the margin expansion of 30 bps driven by the price material favorability and the volume growth with the supply chain creating -- and headwinds along with nonmaterial inflation.\nI think it's worth a little bit commenting on orders here. We've had orders in line with sales, so balanced between book and bill. We get a lot of questions from investors if we have seen slowing here in the order pattern and we have not. We -- but we're obviously very aware of what's happening to the consumer out there. And so that's causing us to watch our order pattern very carefully.\nIt's causing us to invest in productivity, and it's causing us to contingency plan in case we do see a slowdown. As we think about watching carefully, it's become -- it will become a little challenging as we get closer to year-end, customer behavior in a year like this can get distorted. They each have incentive plans with their employers. It's very common for those incentive plans for the executives to have growth component as well as an inventory component.\nAnd in a year when people have reached their growth targets, they can switch towards managing inventories down. So it's not unusual in a year like this for us to see kind of distorted year-end order pattern. So as we watch orders, we have to be careful not to overreact to 1 week or 1 month and be thoughtful and understand exactly what we're seeing.\nBut again, for now, not seeing any slowdown. We also said we're investing in productivity. And you can see that -- on the right side, in the last bullet, we've had extra investing in productivity and restructuring in this segment. That's caused about an 80-point drag in margin. So there -- had we not been doing that investing you'd have seen a better margin expansion.\nBut I think investments in both automation and footprint consolidation that we're doing there, proving to be very important for a successful future in the segment.\nSo on Page 9, I wanted to transition to how the 2 segments performance, which you just discussed as influenced our view of the outlook for the balance of '22. And based on our better-than-expected performance in Q3 which we had talked about that a couple of weeks ago or last month in Laguna.\nWe outperformed our expectations and are thus raising our guidance. The effect of that is to take EPS from a previous range of $9.40 to $9.80 and we're taking that up to $10.25 to $10.45. That's really been a consistent outperformance throughout the year. Qs 1, 2 and 3, all showing both volume and maybe even especially price being able to do better than expected.\nIf you look at the left-hand column on Page 9, we started the year with expectations of 8% to 10% sales growth which was centered at 4 points of volume and 5 points of price. And we've done considerably better than that on price and better on volume as well.\nAnd that's kind of been consistently shown throughout the quarters of the year. And as you look at -- I like this visual of our performance because you can see that the volume is dropping through and adding nicely to last year's level of our EPS. But you can really see how important our pricing strategy has been in order to get price to overcome the costs in any of the inefficiencies.\nGood to see the M&A program when we had a couple of additions during the second quarter. In the form of PCX, which is a data center business performing really, really nicely since we've owned it. Ripley Tools on the Utility side, extending our brands there also performing really well. So good to see them contribute to earnings this year.\nAnd since they were midyear acquisitions, they'll contribute incrementally next year as well. I think important to note, we're not harvesting all of the earnings we could. We continue to believe it's really important to invest to make sure our future success is as bright as it can be. And the 3 principal areas there include productivity. That's as I said, automation and plant consolidation.\nIt's capacity additions in the Utility segment, and there's innovation spending across both segments that we're trying to accelerate our new product development growth and allow us to outperform our end markets and do better in the future.\nThe non-op items are offsetting here where some share repurchases and other income are offset by higher taxes -- slightly higher taxes. And I'd add at the bottom, our free cash flow, we had been centered at a 95% conversion rate and as the growth has exceeded our expectations, we believe we need to invest more heavily in inventory and receivables to support our customers. We also feel the need to invest in CapEx. And so we're bringing that free cash flow down around 90% conversion.\nBut with the increase in earnings we're going to get to the dollars we are expecting in -- we just had a lower conversion rate. And I think as we get to next year, we'd probably be able to manage the working capital accounts on the balance sheet more efficiently and continue to improve on our customer service. So we've got some nice trends that we think we're finishing the year with, and I'll hand it to Gerben to talk about how that informs our outlook for next year.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nYes. Great. Thanks, Bill. And before we turn it over to Q&A, we wanted to provide some initial thoughts on our setup into 2023. And how Hubbell is planning to deliver continued attractive results for our shareholders.\nWhile the macro environment remains uncertain headed into next year, we are confident that our markets are well positioned to continue outperforming GDP. In Utility Solutions, we believe there is still plenty of runway and above average visibility to continued growth driven by long-term grid modernization trends. In Electrical Solutions, we expect residential markets to remain challenging but we believe that the 20% of segment revenues exposed to our strategic growth verticals in T&D, renewables, data centers and communications should prove resilient to cyclical dynamics.\nOperationally, while commodity prices have eased, we are planning for general inflationary and supply chain pressures to persist. We will continue to manage price and actively drive productivity to come out net neutral or better relative to our overall cost base.\nWe also plan to continue reinvesting in our business to deliver long-term growth and productivity. In Utility Solutions, we plan to invest in capacity expansion to service a visible long-term growth profile.\nAs we have highlighted in the past, the inflection in T&D markets from a low single-digit growth to mid-single-digit growth over the past several years has caused us to bump against capacity constraints in certain key product lines. Looking ahead, we see a unique opportunity to further strengthen our position and better support visible customer investment plans by executing on high-return expansion and innovation projects.\nIn Electrical Solutions, we plan to maintain elevated investment levels to support footprint optimization projects as we continue our multiyear journey as a unified operating segment with structurally higher long-term margin profile. The net of these early considerations for next year and acknowledging that there remains a lot of uncertainty is that we are expecting to deliver solid performance in 2023 across a range of macroeconomic scenarios.\nWe plan to provide a more detailed '23 outlook on our typical cadence along the release and discussion of our fourth quarter earnings results.\nWith that, let me now turn it over to Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program may be recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Dan Innamorato, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter 2022 results. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference into this call.\nAdditionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's second quarter results. I will open our call this morning with a broad overview of our performance, markets and the investments we continue to make that drive value for our stakeholders. Bill will then provide details on our second quarter results, and I'll come back with some comments on the outlook for the year.\nHubbell delivered another strong quarter of operating performance with year-over-year organic growth of 20% and adjusted operating profit growth of 29%. We are performing above our initial expectations through the first half of the year and have generated year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of 29% through the first 2 quarters. We are raising our annual outlook this morning to reflect that strong performance.\nWhile we anticipate the second half operating environment to remain dynamic, and we see uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute effectively and deliver on the stronger outlook due to three key factors: the strength of our end markets; the strength of our position in those markets; and our continued operational execution, particularly proactively managing price/cost as well as supply chain constraints.\nStarting with markets. Customer demand for reliable and efficient critical infrastructure solutions in front and behind the meter continues to drive strong orders and sales growth. In particular, the Utility Solutions segment continues to build backlog even as customer shipments pick up sequentially. Grid modernization initiatives continue to drive robust investment levels from our core utility customers as they seek to upgrade and harden aging infrastructure while integrating renewables onto the grid. Our leading quality, reliability and service in these markets continue to position us well to effectively serve these critical needs for our customers.\nIn Electrical Solutions, demand remains strong across most of our end markets. Electrification trends together with strong industrial and nonresidential markets continue to drive sales and order growth across most of our Electrical businesses, while residential markets remain soft as anticipated.\nI'd also like to highlight the ongoing strength we are seeing in communications markets, which is a key strategic vertical for Hubbell spanning across both segments. Telecommunications customers continue to invest in building out 5G networks, rural broadband access and fiber-to-the-home upgrades, driving demand for leading products and solutions across the Hubbell portfolio including enclosures, connectors, tooling and antennas.\nResults in the quarter were also driven by continued execution on price/cost. Price realization was 14% in the quarter, up again sequentially as the company continued to actively manage price and productivity to offset broad-based inflationary pressures. While material inflation is showing signs of easing, nonmaterial inflation and supply chain headwinds persist. Increased cost of labor, freight and logistics as well as tight availability in key materials and components continue to drive higher input costs and manufacturing and transportation efficiencies across our businesses. Despite these challenges, we were able to drive increased unit output and achieved strong year-over-year operating margin expansion of 130 basis points in the second quarter.\nOverall, a very strong quarter for Hubbell. We are confident in our ability to continue to effectively navigate a dynamic environment, and we are raising our full year expectations this morning, while at the same time, accelerating investments in the second half of the year to position us well for sustained long-term outperformance. We'll provide more color on the full year outlook at the end of this presentation.\nBefore I turn it over to Bill to talk you through the financial results in more detail, I would like to welcome PCX and Ripley Tools to the Hubbell portfolio. These 2 high-quality businesses, which we acquired earlier this month, have strong financial profiles and attractive growth characteristics and bolster our position in key strategic growth verticals of data centers, renewables, electric T&D and communications. We also have a strong cash position and balance sheet and expect to continue investing in acquisitions as a core component of our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks very much, Gerben, and appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'm going to kick off my remarks with a shout out to Stones fans and recognizing Mick Jagger's birthday today.\nI'm going to start on Page 4 of the materials that Dan referenced, and I hope you found those. Starting with sales, $1.26 billion, 20% organic growth over last year, with very healthy contributions from both price and volume. OP margins of 16.6%, 130 basis points of margin expansion there. Really getting the drop through from incremental volumes and the price/cost tailwind. Earnings per share of $2.81. We saw the OP contributions to those earnings below the line. We have tailwinds from non-OP. And we bought some shares that reduced the share count and helped EPS. Those were offset by a more normalized tax level in '22 versus a lower level in the prior year. And then for cash flow, $168 million in the quarter resulting -- driven by higher income but with investments in both CapEx and in working capital, which we'll talk more about.\nSo really a very strong quarter, high-quality beat of our own expectations. There's a lot of moving pieces as you see, but the simple part of our story is better volume and better price/cost. And that's really the driver that you'll hear a lot about in our time this morning.\nPage 5, the enterprise results laid out here. Again, see the sales of 19% to $1.256 billion. That's comprised of 14% price, 6% units and a point of drag from foreign exchange. So the 19% is obviously very strong compared to last year. When we do a sequential look back to the first quarter also, a very strong compare with sales up high single digits and about half of that driven by price and half driven by incremental volume. So I think strong top line in both perspectives.\nAnd I'd say that the fact that we're able to get more volume out in the second quarter is a good sign, implies that our factories were able to improve their capacity slightly even though the headwinds inside the supply chain still persist with labor materials and transportation, all being a little bit inconsistent and continuing to cause inefficiencies on the part of our manufacturing operations. But the order pattern remains solid. Really, really good broad-based demand, and we'll talk more about that in each segment.\nOn the upper right of Page 5, our operating profit up 29% to $208 million, 16.6%, about 130 basis point margin expansion. Decent incrementals in the mid-20s being driven by 6 points of volume and the drop-through there. Tailwind from price/cost, but some partial offsets from nonmaterial inflation as well as some of the plant inefficiencies and other returning costs. So we tend to focus purely on the materials, but the nonmaterial inflation is still an important factor in our financial performance here in the second quarter.\nEPS, up 27% to $2.81 and growth roughly in line with the operating profit growth. And free cash flow growing to $168 million, 41%. Looks like good growth, but in order for us to continue to meet our full year target, we need to have a very strong second half of cash flow collection as is typical for us. Fourth quarter tends to be our largest quarter. So that measure is quite back-end loaded.\nIt is noteworthy though, I think the amount of -- that we're investing in CapEx is up about 16% in the quarter. So that's a claim on these cash flows and continue to invest in working capital. Receivables, naturally up with sales. And inventory, up as we continue to try to support our customers and have inventory on hand to support the 20% sales growth. So good cash flow growth despite some strong investments and continue to need to focus on some cash flow in the second half.\nNow I wanted to talk about each segment and their performance, and I was going to start with the Electrical segment on Page 6. Sales up in the Electrical segment, 13%. Nice solid growth rate. About 10 points of price, about 4 of volume and a 1 point of drag from foreign exchange. Really saw broad strength across the Electrical segment with the very notable exception of the resi business, which I'll come to in a second. But the various components of the nonresi part of the segment. Good strength in nonres, good strength in light industrial, both of the Burndy and Wiring Device brands doing very well in those markets. The heavy industrial markets also doing very well for us. And I think Gerben noted some of the verticals and communications and data centers, providing some really nice growth for us there across the segment.\nResi, definitely the notable exception to that good news. Resi, for us, representing about 15% of the segment sales, and they were down double digits. So it had a significant effect on performance here.\nOn the operating profit side, you see $83 million of adjusted operating profit, generated a 14% growth to the prior year at 15.7% OP margins, slight improvement over last year. So the volume growth of 4 points dropped through at attractive incrementals. We have positive price cost. Those are offset partially by the supply chain inflationary headwinds, and we also had higher restructuring investment in the segment.\nI think that it's worth noting if without the resi drag on margins, the segment would have had about 1 point of margin expansion. So slightly being 15% of the segment resi's impacting the performance there.\nOn Page 7, I want to switch to talking about the Utility Solutions segment. And you can see just an excellent quarter turned in by our partners in the utility segments driven mostly by the performance of Hubbell Power Systems within the segment. So overall, $729 million of sales, representing a 24% increase from prior year. That's got price in the mid-teens and volume in the high single digits.\nWe've experienced robust demand on the T&D Components side. That's really the legacy Hubbell Power Systems and you see 32% growth there, just a lot of demands from utilities to continue to satisfy their needs to harden their infrastructure against environmental impact, integrate renewables and upgrade their networks. So a very strong demand and a position in the industry where we enjoy a lot of strength. And we continue to get very positive customer feedback that despite the fact that our services right now below our standards and our lead times are longer than we'd like, representing some of the supply chain difficulties. We're getting feedback from our customers that we are outperforming the competition. And I think that's serving us very well.\nThe second part of the segment after the T&D Components is the Communications & Controls. You'll see that's up more modestly at 3% and the meters continue to be constrained by chip shortages. And though there's adequate backlog to support a lot more growth, the supply chain is just not cooperating to let us satisfy all that.\nSo on the right side of the page in operating profit, you see this segment generated $125 million of adjusted operating profit, 40% increase from the prior year and over a 200 basis point margin expansion to 17.2%. That margin expansion is being driven by the drop-through on the incremental volume, which is substantial plus the price material cost favorability. And they're overcoming the supply chain headwinds in order to drive that margin performance. So a really nice job by our utility team and really helping drive performance of the whole enterprise.\nOn Page 8, I wanted to recall us for a minute to Investor Day just a couple of months ago where we introduced a very simple construct, which started with, first of all, us feeling that our high-quality products and solutions would be able to grow as the end markets they are exposed to grow. And we are anticipating that those end markets would outgrow GDP.\nPart of the reason is we highlighted these 6 growth verticals where we have an outsized exposure, about 40% of the sales exposed to these markets. And we think each of these will outperform GDP.\nWe also introduced the second construct, which is that we had management levers to help us outgrow the end markets, which we think will outgrow GDP. Specifically, there we're going to use innovation, acquisitions and some sales and marketing initiatives. And the third bucket of levers was to manage price/cost productivity as well as restructuring, and we'll talk about those at the moment as well.\nSo Gerben had indicated 2 acquisitions, and it just helps illustrate the point we're making at Investor Day, which is while we're exposed to these markets, we think they're going to outgrow the GDP. We also are going to be directional and intentional with our investment and invest specifically in these verticals. And in July, closing on 2 acquisitions. So they are subsequent events to the second quarter, but we will enjoy their performance for the second half of this year and then the full year next year.\nWe're very excited to have both of these fine companies in the portfolio. The first one is Ripley Tools, and Ripley is a bolt-on for our utility segment. A Connecticut-based company founded in 1936. So very well-established brands, high-quality products that are primarily focused to the communications area where they're working on fiber optic and telecom applications, some specialized tools required for that as well as some tools for the power -- the T&D industry that are a full complement to some tools that Hubbell has in its portfolio. So last year's sales of about $20 million. We paid ballpark of about $50 million for the business. High-growth, high-margin, exact example of getting exposure to markets where we think we can win, and we think we can outgrow the economy.\nOn the right side, is PCX. And I know you've heard us talk about an interest in increasing our exposure to data centers, and PCX represents a significant step forward for us in that regard. They make prefabricated electric rooms for data centers. Basically, provide the power, power quality, uninterrupted supply. They do so by using manufactured labor in a plant rather than needing specialized labor on site. And so you're picking up a number of themes here with this investment. One is the data center growth. Two is the arbitrage and labor from on-site specialty to manufactured labor inside of a plant. And the third is the dramatic reduction in the cycle time that results from using these modular prefab units. And that's really of interest to the owner operators of the mega centers and in the colos as well. So we think we're smart investment there, sales of about $50 million and a little bit less than $130 million investment.\nSo when you look at the 2 together, we spent about $175 million, invested. We think they will have about a 1 point impact on growth in 2022. We think for the balance of the year, they will contribute roughly $0.10 of earnings and have a bigger impact next year in '23. And I think as we stand back and evaluate '22, at the halfway point, we've had some important portfolio reshapings where we sold our C&I Lighting business for about $350 million. We've added these 2, and we bought about $150 million worth of shares earlier at the end of the first quarter. So we have essentially deployed the cash from that sale, replaced the earnings and positioned ourselves with much higher growth, much higher margin businesses. So I think a good example in just 6 months of the power of focusing on the portfolio.\nSo with that, I'd like to turn it back to Gerben to talk about the outlook for the remainder of 2022.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And I'd like to close our prepared remarks today with some comments on that '22 outlook on Page 9. As we highlighted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our full year 2022 outlook. We now anticipate mid-teens full year sales growth, up from low double digits from the prior guidance. And we are raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.40 to $9.80 versus a prior range of $9 to $9.40. We continue to anticipate generating free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100% of adjusted earnings per share.\nRelative to our prior guidance, this raised 2022 outlook is driven primarily by stronger first half performance, stronger volume and price material assumptions, and a modest contribution from acquisitions and partially offset by higher general inflationary pressures and targeted investments in the second half.\nWhen we spoke to you all at Investor Day in early June, we outlined three key areas where we are looking to invest over the next 3 to 5 years. Footprint optimization and restructuring to drive a more efficient manufacturing and distribution network, primarily across our Electrical Solutions segment as we continue our HES journey as a unified operating segment. Second, targeted capacity expansion in markets with visible growth trajectories and strong Hubbell positions, primarily in certain power T&D and communication product lines where capacity is tight and customers have critical needs for our products. And finally, innovation to accelerate organic growth with an emphasis to capitalize on attractive megatrends and key strategic growth verticals through new products, solutions and go-to-market strategies.\nWhile we recognize that the near-term macroeconomic environment is uncertain, we believe that now is an opportune time to accelerate some of these previously planned investments from a position of strength to set the company up for sustained performance over the long term. We expect these initiatives to drive future productivity and cost savings while enabling us to better serve the critical infrastructure needs of our customers with differentiated solutions in front and behind the meter.\nTo summarize this morning's call, Hubbell is off to a strong start through the first half of 2022. We have leading positions in attractive markets with long-term growth drivers and we are executing effectively in the areas within our control. We are confident in delivering on our raised 2022 outlook and in driving differentiated results to our shareholders over the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the first quarter 2022 results conference call. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now it is my pleasure to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Dan Innamorato, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter 2022 results. The press release and slides are posted to the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note that our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and consider it incorporated by reference into this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerben .\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's first quarter results.\nHubbell is off to a strong start in 2022. Our markets remain healthy with broad-based demand driving strong sales and order growth. In particular, our Utility Solutions segment continues to build backlog even as customer shipments picked up sequentially. Grid modernization initiatives continue to drive robust investment levels from our core utility customers as they seek to upgrade aging infrastructure and integrate renewables onto the grid.\nOperationally, supply chain headwinds persist. Inflation in raw materials and labor, tight availability and higher cost of containers as well as shortages in key materials such as chips and resins are leading to higher input costs and manufacturing and transportation inefficiencies across our businesses. However, we are executing effectively through these challenges to serve our customers and deliver strong results for our shareholders.\nWe continue to accelerate our price and productivity initiative, and we have now turned the corner on price material, which was a net positive in the first quarter. The combination of strong volume growth and positive price material enabled us to return to year-over-year margin expansion a quarter earlier than we had initially anticipated.\nOverall, we are pleased with the performance in the quarter, and we are confident that we are well positioned to continue executing effectively over the balance of 2022. While the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, our strong order book, significant price traction and operational discipline gives us visibility and confidence to raise our full year outlook today, which now reflects mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth. We will provide more color on the full year outlook later in the presentation.\nBefore I turn it over to Bill to walk you through the financial results, I'd like to highlight some key accomplishments in the quarter. First, on capital deployment, we deployed $150 million of proceeds from the C&I Lighting divestiture to share repurchase, returning cash to shareholders and generating approximately $0.10 of accretion in 2022, in line with our initial guidance. Our balance sheet and cash position is strong, supporting our bolt-on acquisition strategy, which we expect to continue executing over the short and long term to generate attractive returns for our shareholders.\nNext, I'm proud to highlight that Hubbell received 2 of 4 annual awards from a major customer. Hubbell Power Systems was awarded the Above and Beyond Award for successfully managing through supply chain constraints to service customers while Burndy was awarded the Operational and Technical Excellence award for improvements in operational efficiency and proactive management and communication. This recognition is particularly well deserved for our teams who are working so hard to effectively serve our customer needs during these challenging times. Not only is this an example of the strength of Hubbell's individual brands and businesses, but it also demonstrates the quality of our portfolio across utility and electrical end markets. We have made good progress in our efforts to go to market collectively as One Hubbell, and we see significant opportunity ahead in building on our strong channel partnerships to better serve our customers.\nAnd finally, Hubbell is honored to have been named one of 2022's World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for the second consecutive year. I'd like to thank our over 17,000 employees who demonstrate the highest standard for integrity each and every day and note that this achievement is a recognition of their commitment to compliance and ethics as a foundation of our strategy and culture. We also released our second annual sustainability report in the first quarter, highlighting the progress we have made on ESG over the past several years as a core element of our business strategy and product offering. We encourage all our stakeholders to view this report on the Sustainability page of our website and to continue to actively engage with the Hubbell leadership team on ESG topics.\nLet me now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, Gerben. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate you joining. I'm aware of how busy the day is. And I'll try to keep my comments short and sweet and open with a happy birthday to our own Dan Innamorato today.\nAnd as Gerben said, really off to a strong start to the year. And there's really 2 notable management accomplishments that are driving the results, and you'll hear us comment several times. The first is price.\nI know you're all aware that we got behind last year. And as inflation persisted throughout the last of the 5 quarters, we relentlessly kept working with our channel partners to raise price. And I think the fact that we caught up and created a tailwind in the first quarter of '22 is really good evidence of the high quality of our products and how well positioned they are both in front and behind and at the meter where -- essentially at low cost relative to the value that they add.\nThe second besides price was our production levels. I think, as you know, we've been operating for a while constrained not by orders but constrained by supply chain. And so it's a great sign to see sequential increase from Q4 to Q1, which is typically a decline in output. And for us to increase the units there, some evidence that getting better and fighting through some of the supply chain constraints. And when you have both that price and production level raise and with the backdrop of strong orders, you're going to see very high growth in sales and earnings, which is what you'll see in our results release today.\nI'm going to start on Page 4 of the materials. You can see sales increase of 21% to $1.16 billion. That 21% was driven by organic growth as well as price. As I mentioned, that's a comparison to the prior year. Sequentially as well, we saw mid-single-digit growth versus the fourth quarter of last year with both units and price being up sequentially.\nAt the operating profit level, you see 20 basis points of margin expansion to 13.9%. Welcome to see that return to margin expansion, and we really have the price material tailwind complementing the volume growth to help drive that. Earnings per share, you see an increase of 30% year-over-year to $2.12, driven by the operating profit growth as well as some other income tailwind.\nOn the cash flow side, we had a use of $36 million in the quarter. The extraordinary high level of sales required a large investment in receivables, and we also invested aggressively in inventory. And we continue -- Gerben pointed out the customer awards that we received. We continue to try to serve the customer, make sure we've got inventory on hand and keep our service levels as high as possible given some of the choppy operating environment that we're in.\nOn Page 5, you see the results laid out a little more graphically. That 21% sales growth unpacks into 12 points of price and 9 points of units. That skews slightly higher for the utilities segment, which we'll talk about separately, both in units and price. But the Electrical segment also showed very strong growth. So a very broad-based demand profile here. And despite the 21% increase in shipments, orders were up 25%, so we actually built more backlog in the quarter.\nAt the operating profit level, you see the impressive 22% growth to $160 million in the quarter and that volume growth and price material tailwind really combining to create some nice lift. On the margin side, there's a partial offset for the nonmaterial inflation. Think of things like compensation costs and transportation costs eating into some of those gains as well as some inefficiencies in the factory where the supply chain and consistency -- think of both labor and material not being available as consistently as is typical. And so when you're operating at high levels of volume, there's some inefficiencies in spending that are going on inside of our plants.\nEPS is up 30%, just under $0.50 of new earnings coming from all this growth, to $2.12. The growth rate is higher than the OP growth rate because of some -- we have interest expense lower as a result of a bond refinancing we did last year as well as some transition services income. But the taxes were comparable in the period, so not a tax driver there.\nHere, you see the cash flow use laid out compared to a small source of cash last year. Typically, the first quarter is our weakest cash flow year -- or sorry, weakest cash flow quarter in the year. And we still anticipate meeting our initial targets on free cash flow. This is just early investment in the year at a time of high growth in receivables first and inventory second.\nWe're going to now unpack our results by segment, and we'll start on Page 6 with our Electrical segment. You can see the impressive growth of 19%, all organic, 10 points from price, 9 points from volume, quite a broad-based contribution to the demand profile. Light industrial, up in the mid-20s. Data centers and telecom, I would note as verticals inside of that space. Nonres, similarly up strong in the mid-20s. Heavy industrial, up in the mid-20s. Strong commodity prices that we see in both steel, for example, and oil and gas are good indicators for our heavy industrial business customers still pushing demand up.\nAnd the exception to the really strong outlook is on the residential side. We had some tough compares to a very heavy amount of home remodeling done last year as people were spending more time in their house than they wanted to. No travel, not commuting to work, we saw a lot of attention spent to remodeling, which has been difficult to compare against.\nOn the OP side, double-digit growth for the Electrical segment at 11% to $58 million. You see that the margins though did not expand in sympathy with the company. And though we got good drop-through on our incremental volumes and price material was favorable, that was more than offset by the inflation in transportation. And that was really most acutely felt by our residential business, which is essentially a purchase for resale.\nAnd the container costs, transportation costs become a very large hit to that business as those costs spiked up and as well as extra spending on restructuring. So if the residential business had, had a comparable year to last year, you would have seen comparable margins. And the extra investment in restructuring, which will create productivity and higher margin in the future caused an additional 0.5 point drag. So I think the underlying business is very healthy here.\nIn Page 7, we transition to showing the utility segment and a very strong performance. We've built quite a strong franchise here on the utility side, 22% growth, which is actually 23% organic. We sold a very small product line from inside the Aclara business. And that 23% organic unpacks to 13 points of price and 10 points of volume. Again, kind of note that the volume was 7% higher sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year. And inside the Utility Solutions segment is where we have the more pronounced buildup of backlog. And so getting the bottlenecks eased out and our production capacity up has been a very welcome sign, and you can see that drop through on the operating profit side.\nBut finishing on sales, really saw strength from the Power Systems side and the Transmission & Distribution components as well as gas components. We had growth in the 30% range. And on the Communications & Control side, the Aclara AMI and Meters business continues to be constrained by the lack of availability of chips, and we expect that condition to persist throughout the year.\nBut the entire segment is still powering with very strong growth. And you see the drop-through effect of having price material tailwind, which -- this was the quarter that the power team caught up on that. And you see the welcome lift in margin expansion of nearly 1 point. So you got above 20% sales growth with 90 bps of margin expansion. You get a lot of OP lift and really helping add to our earnings per share story.\nSo that gets me to Page 8 and the impact of those trends and results on our outlook. And I would say, usually, we would consider this to be too early a point in the year to consider a raise, especially with as much macro uncertainty as there is. But we started with a higher-than-normal backlog. We added to that backlog despite shipping 21% increase in sales. And the prices really seem to be sticking, and we're going to get some incremental price. And so that's causing us to anticipate higher sales than we had initially guided you to, and we're going to reflect that new outlook in this guidance.\nSo when we came out in January, we were describing an expected sales growth of 8% to 10%, which was comprised of 5% price and 3% to 5% of volume. And so given what we've seen through the first quarter on price sticking as well as some anticipated incremental price that we're going to ask for, we believe that price will be more in the range of 7% for the year; and that volume, which we had anticipated at 3% to 5%, we feel now will be coming through at 4% to 6%.\nAnd the effect of this change at the sales side, effectively imagining the price being absorbed by incremental inflation, so it leaves us an extra point of volume. That extra point of volume, we think, should drop on the order of $0.20 to the year. And so what we've done is raise the midpoint of our outlook range from $9 to $9.20. So in other words, we've kind of maintained our margin outlook, and we've maintained the percentage drop-through free cash flow that we're expecting between 90% and 100%.\nWorth noting, I think, that there are no new incremental acquisitions included in this guidance. We are pleased that, that pipeline seems to be refilling. And we feel we're quite intentional in finding verticals that have high growth and high margins in them. And so just to comment there that acquisitions are not included in this outlook.\nSo with that, I would turn it back to Gerben for some closing remarks.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And before we begin, Q&A, I'd just like to underscore a couple of key points from this morning's presentation.\nHubbell is off to a running start in 2022 after strong execution in the first quarter. And while the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and uncertain, we have strong positions in attractive end market with long-term growth drivers, and we are executing well in the areas that are within our control. We are confident that we are positioned to deliver on our '22 outlook, which we raised this morning, and drive strong results for our shareholders over the long term.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Q&A.",

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Hubbell 2021 Results Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would like to hand the conference over to Dan Innamorato. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Joseph Innamorato\n\nDirector of IR, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter 2021. The press release and slides are posted at the Investors section of our website at hubbell.com. I'm joined today by our Chairman, President and CEO, Gerben Bakker; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Bill Sperry.\nPlease note our comments this morning may include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Therefore, please note the discussion of forward-looking statements in our press release and considered incorporated by reference into this call. Additionally, comments may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures are reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are included in the press release and slides.\nBefore we get started, we also want to highlight that all results in our press release and the materials for this call are presented on a continuing operations basis, excluding the financial impact of our C&I Lighting business, following the recent closing of that divestiture and the classification of C&I Lighting as discontinued operations. We've also recast prior period financial results on a continuing operations basis to ensure we're presenting the most relevant year-over-year comparisons and baseline for future results. These recast financials are summarized in this morning's press release.\nNow let me turn the call over to Gerben.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss Hubbell's fourth quarter and full year results. As you saw from our press release, we achieved a strong finish to 2021 with solid operating results in the quarter. The performance of our core continuing operations in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, which were embedded in our most recent outlook a few months ago. Most notably, our Electrical Solutions segment drove exceptional performance, with close to 50% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter.\nDemand remains strong for Utility and Electrical Solutions. We grew backlog further in the third quarter as orders continue to outpace increased shipments, particularly in our Utility segment. For the full year 2021, we grew orders more than 30% year-over-year and are exiting the year with a record backlog. While we expect supply chain dynamics to remain tight and continue to constrain output into 2022, we are confident that grid modernization and electrification are secular trends, which will drive attractive GDP plus growth over the next several years. And we will talk more about our unique positioning and the investments we are making.\nFrom an operational standpoint, I am also pleased to highlight we turned the corner on price material in the fourth quarter. We achieved 11 points of price realization, which fully offset the impact of material cost inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Though material inflation has been an accelerating headwind throughout 2021, we have been proactive and aggressive in our pricing actions, which have stepped up significantly as we have progressed through the year, and this sets us up well to turn this equation into a net tailwind in 2022.\nFinally, we are providing our initial 2022 outlook this morning, which anticipates strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We will talk about the outlook in more detail at the end of this presentation, but we expect continued strength in customer demand and significant price material tailwind to enable Hubbell to continue to navigate through a challenging supply chain environment, while investing in our business to better serve our customers, all while continuing to drive strong financial results for our shareholders.\nWe thought it would be helpful to give a brief update on our portfolio and strategy following the divestiture of C&I Lighting. What we have achieved with this strategic action is a more focused portfolio with leading positions across the energy infrastructure in front of the meter, behind the meter and at the edge. Strategically, we are focused on providing our customers with reliable and efficient critical infrastructure solutions in markets with higher growth and margin characteristics, where we have a unique right to play and ability to win.\nNote that we have broken out the Electrical Solutions segment for you to provide more context on our product offering and market exposure, highlighting the depth and breadth of our electrical offerings across the industrial, nonresidential and residential markets. However, as we announced over a year ago, we now manage this segment as a unified business to more effectively utilize the combined strength of our brands products and organizational talent in order to better serve our customers. This integration has been highly successful and you will see some of the early returns on this strategy when we take you through the Electrical Solutions results.\nIn the Utility Solutions segment, we continue to believe that we have a best-in-class franchise with 2 highly complementary businesses. Our leading position across components, communications and controls enables us to offer uniquely differentiated solutions to our customers across electric, water and gas applications. Utility Solutions now represents over half our total enterprise sales following the divestiture of C&I Lighting.\nWe are very pleased with the evolution of our portfolio, and we believe these actions position Hubbell well for the long term. We continue to view portfolio management as an ongoing process and an important lever to drive value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Hubbell has a proven track record of effective capital deployment and we expect to continue to deliver attractive returns to our M&A model.\nNow building off the portfolio discussion, we also wanted to highlight the importance of ESG to our strategy. Hubbell has made significant progress on ESG over the past year, increasing our disclosures as well as setting multiyear targets for improvements on key metrics. We released our inaugural Sustainability Report in late 2021, and we encourage all of our stakeholders to view this report on the Sustainability section of our website and to continue to actively engage with the Hubbell leadership team on ESG topics.\nESG at Hubbell is directly aligned to our business strategy. In our Utility Solutions business, our products are critical to ensuring that electricity is transmitted and distributed safely, reliably and efficiently throughout the grid. As the leading utility T&D component supplier, we play a critical role in bolstering the resilience of the grid as well as in hardening the infrastructure to withstand the impact of climate events and enabling the transition to clean renewable energy. Our unique combination of utility components, communications and controls also enables us to play a leading role in making the utility infrastructure smarter across electric, water and gas applications.\nIn our Electrical Solutions segment, we provide solutions that enable the owners and operators of critical infrastructure to reliably and efficiently utilize electricity. These solutions are serving increasingly diversified end markets as electrification drives more applications to be plugged into the grid. Electrical T&D utility automation and controls, renewables, data communication and electric transportation are among our most attractive market verticals currently and we see significant opportunity to drive further value for our customers and shareholders in these areas.\nWhen we talk about orienting our portfolio towards high-growth, high-margin verticals, these are the areas of our portfolio where we see the most opportunity and return on invested capital. And for these reasons, we are stepping up our investment levels in 2022. Reinvigorating our innovation strategy is a key priority for Hubbell, but we plan to innovate while sticking to our roots and evaluating opportunities to our lens of where we have a clear right to play and ability to win.\nFor instance, it has become increasingly clear to us over the past several years that our Power T&D components business has transitioned from a GDP grower to sustainable GDP plus trajectory, and we are investing in additional capacity in key product categories in that business to effectively serve strong and visible customer demand. We've also driven substantial recent growth in our electrical connection and bonding offering for solar, telecom and data center applications, and we are investing in additional sales and engineering resources there to more effectively pursue those opportunities. We are confident that we can accomplish this while continuing to deliver attractive and differentiated earnings growth over the near and long term.\nAnd with that, let me now turn it over to Bill to walk you through our near-term financial results and outlook. Bill?\n\nWilliam R. Sperry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nThanks a lot, Gerben, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate you joining us. I'm going to use the slides to guide my comments, and I hope you found those. I'm going to be starting on Page 6, which takes the fourth quarter results for us on a continuing operations basis. I'll make some comments when we get to the full year on how discontinued operations contributed so that we can see things on the same format that we started the year on.\nBut you see the fourth quarter results showed impressive sales growth of 20% to $1.1 billion. That 20% is comprised of 4% acquisitions and 16% organic. The 16% organic is comprised of 11 points of price and 5% growth from unit volume. So a very healthy amount of growth. I think commenting on the acquisition growth of 4 points. There were 3 specific acquisitions that contributed to that in the fourth quarter. One on the Electrical segment side; two, on the utility side.\nOn the electrical side, we had invested in a business that makes the mounts and enclosures and antennas for some of the new telecom technology rollout, some of the 5G product exposed to education and health care and warehouses, some verticals that we liked. We also bought an Enclosures business in the utility area that makes enclosures at street level and pedestal level, that electric and telecom utilities put a lot of their electronics in. And the third was in distribution automation area, where we're controlling and protecting infrastructure. And all 3 of those businesses exhibiting high margin and high growth. So some of those, we invested just about $235 million in those.\nAnd so I'm spending some time illustrating those because I think it's important that we compare that to thinking about our portfolio changes as we just, this week, closed on the sale of C&I Lighting and thinking about bringing in these higher-margin, higher growth businesses for and swapping out that more challenged, lower growth, lower margin businesses, something that we're happy to keep continuing, as Gerben mentioned, in our M&A strategy.\nWe'll talk more about the 5 volume points on the next couple of pages when we talk about the 2 different segments. But in general, despite the impressive year-over-year growth of the 20%, it's also good news, I think, sequentially compared to the third quarter, we saw an increase. And usually, typical seasonality would suggest the fourth quarter would be slightly down. So to be up I think, is a testament to some of the backlog that Gerben had mentioned that we had built during the year as well as some sequential price that came in. And I'll talk a little bit more about how our price has progressed and really good news, as Gerben described as turning the corner.\nThe operating profit, also impressive growth at 15% to $153 million. The margin side, however, you see was about 60 basis points lower than previous year. I think the good news to point out about that is as our quarters progressed, this is showing a tighter to prior year level than we've seen year-to-date and I think setting us up to show you margin expansion next year. And it's really been driven by the price cost dynamic.\nOn the cost side, we always look at each quarter compared to the prior -- the quarter of the prior year. And in that viewpoint, the material inflation really accelerated and continued to increase throughout the year, which caused us to have to be quite aggressive and responsive with our pricing. And so to end this quarter with 11 points of price, just to contrast that, in the first quarter, we had pulled 1 point of price, you can see how diligence and effective a process that's been during the year and Hubbell working very closely with its customers and thoughtfully on how to do that.\nI think, in particular, very encouraging to us to have gotten the fourth quarter to a point that we're neutral on dollars between price and costs. I think it's really interesting to note the math on margin, to just have comparable OP with higher cost and higher sales. We actually had a couple of points of margin headwind, even though we were dollar neutral. And so that kind of speaks to the fact that we've still got, we believe, work to do, and we're looking forward to getting those margins expanded in '22.\nEarnings per share up 20% in line with sales, a larger increase in operating profit as we had tailwinds in non-op areas, including better than prior year on the effective tax rate as well as lower interest expense. The free cash flow, you see 70% growth to over $200 million of cash, but I think I'm going to save my cash flow comments until we get to the full year, I think cash flow is better talked about not just the quarterly dynamics, but across really the entire year.\nSo turning to Page 7. We'll start with the Electrical segment results, and this is really where the continuing operations affects -- you see 22% sales growth to $489 million. We had 1% of that was acquired, 14 points of price pulled in the segment and 8% unit growth. So very impressive sales growth, impressive pricing performance, impressive unit expansion. Of note, that 13 points of price is ahead of the company at 11, which is indicating that our Electrical segment is ahead of our Utility segment by about a quarter in terms of getting that price pulled in concert with our distributor customers.\nI think to comment on the 8% unit growth, we had impressive growth in the light industrial product area, some verticals that are really providing attractive dynamics in renewables. Data centers are quite attractive, 5G rollout area, which I had mentioned before. Heavy industrial, we saw double-digit growth, quite strong recovery there. Non-res, on a continued ops basis, our exposure is cut in about half to nonres. But we saw some growth there, expecting that to continue. The one area of softness was in residential and that was really not a demand comment. But a -- on the supply side, a lot of constraints there that prevented our resi business from growing.\nOn the operating profit side, you see 48% growth to $67 million of operating profit, margin expansion of 250 basis points. And you really got a lot of levers working for us here. One is the incremental drop-through on the unit growth. And second is this segment had gotten themselves to a positive tailwind position on price above material costs.\nSo impressive financial performance. I think not coincidental to the financial success is the success of us creating really a new Electrical segment. You recall 1.5 years or so ago, we had been reporting this really as 3 different businesses, bringing it together under one segment has really allowed us to compete collectively. And I think we've got some good traction on that front. I think we've seen both effectiveness benefits as well as efficiency. I think we're more focused on our customer.\nThis pricing performance, I think, is driven in large part, to be able to do that across an entire segment rather than battle it individually and certainly efficiencies in marketing and product development and operations as we utilize factory and distribution center network space. So a very successful implementation of really that one segment, which is quite similar to what we had achieved on the Power side many years ago.\nWorth mentioning the full year for Electrical because this certainly was a quarter of some relatively easier comps. But for the full year, for the Electrical segment on a continuing ops basis, we did see 30% growth in operating profit and 150 basis points of operating margin. So really successful year as well for the segment.\nPage 8, flipping to Utility Solutions. Same story for utilities that we've had over the past few quarters, impressive growth of 19% to over -- to $612 million. We acquired, through the 2 companies I mentioned, 6 points of that growth. Price accounted for 9% and the unit growth was about 4%. So that 9%, as you see, is a little bit behind where our Electrical segment is, but you see the trajectory. The first half was about 2 points for Utility. Third quarter was about 6 points, fourth quarter 9 points. So you can see how we're trending and setting up well for '22, and we'll talk about our outlook in just a minute.\nThe 4% unit growth really is being driven by demand in our Power Systems area, where upgrades, system hardening and modernization continues to be important needs on the part of our customers. We -- as Gerben was describing, the demand that we saw far exceeded our units shipped. And so we have some decent visibility into Power Systems.\nOn the Aclara side, the chip shortages did impact our meter business there. Our results were down a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we're anticipating that showing improvement next year as well.\nOn the operating profit side, you see roughly comparable at $86 million of operating profit but down about 3 points. So again, a slightly similar story to what we talked about in the third quarter, where the price material headwind, though we've gotten price up to 9 points, we're still haven't fully caught up on a dollar basis yet. We see that catching up in the first quarter and ultimately, in the second half, beyond catching up on dollars, we think we can start to get margins to expand in the second half here. So I think the franchise is extremely solid. And as price cost kicks in, you're going to see a solid year, we think, in '22.\nPull the lens back to see the full year for our continuing operations, sales up 14%. The acquisitions were about [4], price was [6], and units were 4 . I'll ask you to just remember that 6 points of price for the whole year, when we talk about next year, that number is important because we ended the fourth quarter with 11, and that leaves us with 5 points of wraparound price, which we'll talk about in our outlook coming up.\nOur operating profit, you see up 8% to $610 million. You see a 14.5% achievement for the year. Just to remind everybody, we burden our operating profit with our restructuring expense as we consider those part of running the business. We don't have a corporate segment, so that's fully loaded also for any corporate overhead. And so I like to think of that 14.5% as kind of a trough number with a year with a dramatic price cost dynamic and that will be onward and upward from here with both our new electrical portfolio as well as price cost turning the corner for us.\nEarnings per share, you see up 13% at $8.05. So this again on the continuing operations basis. If you looked at us on the format that we launched 2021 on and you included the adjusted results from C&I, we would have been around the middle of our guidance range in the full year performance. And really since October, when we were talking about guidance last, our C&I, the discontinued ops, have underperformed and our continuing ops have done better. So we got to that relative mid part of the range, kind of with the strength of our continuing ops.\nOn a free cash flow basis, you see a difference between '20 and '21, '20 being a year where we had our sales down 9% in a year like that. You're essentially liquidating working capital, making working capital source. Here, you see 14% sales increase that required an increase in investment in working capital, notably in receivables and inventory. The supply chain, unreliability, I think caused us to be quite conscious about investing even more in inventory in the fourth quarter. And so you see that $424 million achievement was about at 96% of adjusted net income. So a little short of our target of 100%, driven by that working capital need. And I think that will inform us as we talk about our '22 guidance.\nSo on Page 10, I'd like to start looking forward here and show you how we think 2022 is going to play out. And it really starts with the unit volume on the sales side, which we're thinking in the mid-single-digit range. We continue to think non-res can grow. Light Industrial can grow. We think our T&D electrical utility components can grow at the stronger end. And so the combination of backlog and growth is good there. If you think about how our order book looks in January, you continue to see quite strong demand into the new year that's supportive of that volume of outlook.\nI mentioned the price, we achieved 11% by the fourth quarter and 6% for the year. So that's 5 points of wraparound. And so as we build our waterfall from our [$8.05] starting point, you see 2 really good contributors, the incrementals dropping through on the volume and then the price cost productivity bucket being nice and tall and green. We don't think it's going to be the full effect of the 5 points of price because inflation -- the second pair besides price and in addition to price material cost is nonmaterial inflation against productivity. And we are anticipating continued inflation from areas like salary and wages and transportation, and we expect headwinds in those areas.\nOur productivity is going to be hampered a little bit by returning costs in areas like T&E, we think our salespeople are going to have much more time on the road being able to be with our customers, things like medical and other items we think are returning costs that will prevent productivity from fully offsetting inflation, but still a very healthy contribution from that second green bucket.\nWe've got EPS centered at $9, nice double-digit growth to that. Not all of that volume and price is going to drop through. We are anticipating making some specific investments. On the innovation side, we've got some new product development efforts underway in attractive high-growth areas like renewables, utility automation and comms. We think there are some areas there that we're really well positioned to invest some of this goodness and come out in '23 beyond, much stronger. There's also some capacity expansions in the Power area, which has really continued to grow and so we'll be adding some capacity there.\nIn the nonoperating, you see essentially a breakeven. We're anticipating initiating some share repurchases with the proceeds from the sale of C&I Lighting. We're thinking that could be in the neighborhood of $125 million or so. We've got plenty of authorization from our Board to execute on those levels. There's also some positive contribution from other income relating to some credits we anticipate, getting for supporting transition services around our divestiture and that on nets against anticipated of a normal tax rate, which would reverse some of the tailwind we had this year. So net of that, double-digit growth to $9.\nOn the free cash flow side, we're anticipating similar range to this year. We finished at 96% this year. And as we grow, we think that the investment in working capital is going to be continued to be required. And we also believe that we will be investing on the capital expense side and growing that in double digits way to support the power expansions. And on the Electrical side, a big aggressive plan around automation and driving efficiencies there.\nI think of note, you see that organic investment, but you don't see the benefit from inorganic investment. And the same way we had that $235 million of investment in 3 deals last year, we would hope to be able to deploy some capital on the acquisition side, and we have quite an active pipeline And finding higher growth, higher-margin acquisitions, we hope will enhance this outlook.\nSo with that, I turn it back to Gerben for comments on the new year.\n\nGerben W. Bakker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Hubbell Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And before we begin Q&A, I'd just like to underscore a couple of key points on this morning's presentation. Hubbell is well positioned for the near term and long term. We entered 2022 with a high-quality portfolio of complementary businesses, which are strategically aligned around electrification and grid modernization and with visible strength in demand. While the operating environment remains uncertain, we are turning the corner on price costs and continue to navigate a dynamic supply chain environment to effectively serve our customers. The outlook we have provided to you this morning reflects strong fundamental operating performance, and we are confident in our ability to deliver.\nAnd finally, I want to highlight that we are planning to hold an Investor Day in New York on June 7 of this year, where we look forward to giving you further insight into our long-term strategy. And with that, let's turn it over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Hays Preliminary Results for the Year Ending 30th of June 2025 Conference Call and webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Dirk Hahn, CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nDirk Hahn\n\nCEO & Director\n\nGood morning, and welcome, everyone. I'm Dirk Hahn, Chief Executive, and I'm here with our CFO, James Hilton, to present our 2025 prelim results. Let me start with the market context for our '25 financial year. As we have discussed with many of you before, global record markets were not supportive for the third year in a row, and this length of downturn hasn't been seen before during my 30 years in the business. Why is this? Corporate needs ability to invest by the economic and political uncertainty was weight on business confidence.\nCandidate confidence is also fragile. During the Great Resignation, some candidates, secured employment packages containing a substantially higher salary and ability to work remotely, but wage inflation is now more modest and lifestyle considerations have created a hesitancy to switch drops. This has particularly impacted perm recruitment markets. Temp and contracting has been more resilient and benefits from powerful workplace megatrends, which guide our 5-lever strategy, but it is not immune from these cyclical headwinds.\nFrom Hays perspective, our new shop inflow has not declined materially, but time to hire has [indiscernible]. In the meantime, we have remained resolutely focused on delivering our Five legal strategy, which is designed to increase our exposure to attractive high potential markets and scale back where market forces are less supportive. We are controlling the controllables and improving case with the overarching goal of building a structurally more resilient, profitable and growing business.\nOur presentation today will increase your confidence that we made significant strategic and operational progress in our 2025 financial year despite challenging markets. Our consultant net fee productivity increased during the year was market-leading. Our enterprise business grew strongly. We have taken market share and as James will cover later we have exceeded our structural cost savings to 2 years ahead of schedule.\nBefore we examine this in detail, let me briefly run through a high-level overview of our year. group like-for-like net fees by 11%. Temp & contracting down 7% was more resilient than perm, down 17%. As guided at our June trading update, pre-exceptional operating profit decreased 56% on a like-for-like basis to GBP 45.6 million, impacted by tough conditions key markets, particularly towards the end of the year in perm. And we maintained excellent cost [indiscernible] with GBP 65 million per annum structural savings now secured since the start of the last fiscal year. James will provide more detail later in his section. We are not satisfied with the current profitability, but we are pleased with how we have remained highly disciplined in challenging markets.\nDriven by improved resource allocation, consultant net fee productivity increased by a sector-leading 5%. Secondly, we delivered strong 8% net fee growth in Enterprise Solutions. And thirdly, we have improved our business mix through resilience in temp and contracting and by reshaping our country portfolio. The presentation, I will provide examples outlining how we have achieved this, but first, let me examine our divisional performance. I won't provide a detailed narrative because many of these figures has been previously disclosed. In Germany, like-for-like fees declined 10%. We took decisive action to protect profitability and the division has been relatively resilient in a challenging market, contributing GBP 52.1 million operating profit, down 22%.\nContracting net fees were resilient temp was more challenging because we have better exposure to the promotive sector and slower client decision-making impacted term. However, there were bright spots Growth was strong in Construction & Property, driven by infrastructure projects and energy, and we continue to realign the business to these growth sectors. Despite these headwinds from economic conditions and fewer working hours more than offset cost efficiency initiatives and disciplined pricing. In the U.K. and Ireland, like-for-like net fees declined by 15% and [indiscernible] reported a GBP 5.8 million operating loss. Markets were challenging across the private and public sector, and we experienced a [ prem ] step down in Q4. So driven by our actions to address productivity and costs, we have more actively managed our consultant population, and we are pleased to increase net fee productivity by 9% in H2.\nSecured structural savings in front and back office functions and finally, reduced our office footprint by 19%, delayered our management structure enclosed [indiscernible] our Statement of Work business. We are pleased that the division returned to modest profitability in H2 and is now better positioned for our new divisional to further apply our 5-lever strategy going forward.\nIn [indiscernible] set, like-for-like net fees declined by 13% and the division reported a GBP 3.6 million operating profit. Our management team has increased accountability and alignment to a performance-based culture. So [indiscernible] fee productivity improved by 8% year-on-year to its highest level since 2022. And we increased market share despite challenging market conditions. In the second half, we intensified our initiatives to target high skill growth and in demand for categories. It moved up the food value chain, intense and contracting with pricing mix up 5%. And finally, in Rest of World, like-for-like net fees declined by 8% and following a difficult second half, the division moved to a GBP 4.3 million operating loss from a GBP 19.2 million profit last year. The U.S. delivered a strong performance. Net fee productivity increased by 38%, driving a return to net fee growth and profitability from a loss-making position in the prior year. In LatAm, we closed our businesses in Chile and Colombia and refocus on Brazil and Mexico. In addition, India achieved all high record net fees. Asia was broadly stable overall with profit down modestly. However, activity in EMEA slowed through the year, particularly in Northern Europe.\nThe region delivered GBP 6.9 million operating loss. In response, we took decisive actions, including in France, where we address productivity and costs, changed local management and closed offices. We expect an improved EMEA performance in FY '26. I will update later how we have delivered significant strategic and operational progress in challenging markets.\nBut before then, I will hand over to James to run through our financials in more detail.\n\nJames Hilton\n\nGroup Finance Director & Director\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good morning, everyone. Summarizing our financial performance. On a like-for-like basis, net fees decreased by 11% to GBP 972 million with pre-exceptional [indiscernible] profit down [ 0.06 to 45.6 million ]. .\nOur strong capital to from operations of GBP 128.3 million, up 14% year-on-year and we finished the year with GBP 37 million cash position. Moving on to the income statement. Turnover decreased by 4% with net fees down 11%. The [indiscernible] reported and like-for-like growth rates was primarily the strengthening of sterling versus the year, and overall FX movements decreased net fees and operating costs by GBP 23.1 million and GBP 2.4 million, respectively. The higher decline in net fees relative to turnover was due to the more resilient performance in Temp & Contracting versus Perm in part due to a strong performance in our Enterprise Solutions MSP business. Pre-exceptional earnings per share was 1.31p, a 67% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 57% lower reported operating profit, a higher net finance charge and higher effective rate. Moving on to the performance future [indiscernible].\nTemp fees decreased by 17% and slowed through the year, notably in the fourth quarter. Volumes declined by 20% as we declined in candidate confidence, drove lower conversion of activity to placement. As with prior years, this was partially offset by growth in our average fee of 3%, albeit with wage inflation slowing in most markets. Temp & Contracting fees decreased by 7% year-on-year and show greater resilience in the majority of our markets. We continue to make good progress in building scale around the world in temp and contracting.\nAnd importantly, we delivered year-on-year net fee growth in 5 of our 8 focus countries. Temp volumes declined by 6%, with a further 2% or circa GBP 14 million fee impact from lower [indiscernible] partially offset by a 20 basis point reduction in the underlying to margin.\nOver the next couple of slides, we have set out the decisive actions taken to costs and protect profits structurally improving the group's cost base and better positioning the business for the long term. As explained on the previous slide, we saw a significant reduction in net fees as conditions were challenging across majority of our markets. Our response has been decisive with our operating costs reduced by 6% or GBP 61 million year-on-year. Payroll costs decreased by GBP 62.1 million from the actions taken to reduce [indiscernible] and back office headcount in the year which decreased 14% and 15%, respectively. Commission and bonus payments decreased in line with fees and profit [indiscernible] and partially offsetting this, our average 3% group pay rise in July 2024.\nThese payroll costs by GBP 15.5 million. A [indiscernible] overhead cost income GBP 1 million. We delivered property savings of [ GBP 56 million as ] we closed 29 offices in the year to part of our operational restructuring. These were offset by cost increases in insurance and computer-related costs, driven by cyber and infrastructure, together with broader cost interest. We have taken decisive action to structurally improve the group's cost base across back office on operations delivering so staff benefits.\nOur back office efficiency programs delivered GBP 16 million in annual savings by completing our Americas finance and global technology transformation. In addition, we've made significant progress with our Germany EMEA and APAC finance transformation programs, which would drive a further benefit in FY '26. We delivered GBP 19 million annual savings through restructuring operations in Germany, U.K. Inc, Czech Republic and LatAm. We closed and merge 29 [indiscernible]. And as we announced in our Q3 results, we closed our operations in Chile and Colombia.\nLast August, we set ourselves a target of delivering GBP 30 million per annum in structural cost savings by FY '27. Not only have we surpassed this type but have achieved this 2 years early. So combined with the circa GBP 30 million per annum structural cost saves we reported in FY '24.\nOur actions are structurally lower our cost by GBP 65 million per annum since the start of the last fiscal year. However, we have more to do and we have set ourselves the new ambition of delivering a further GBP 45 million per annum of structural cost savings by FY [ '20 ] through the completion of our global finance program optimizing our technology model, restructuring other global support functions and optimizing our operations globally. During the year, we incurred an exceptional cost of GBP 30.7 million, which comprised 2 parts. As described on the previous slide, we incurred a GBP 17.7 million charge relating to the restructuring of operations in Germany, U.K. and Ireland, France and the Czech Republic.\nWe restructured our back office functions to a several business lines, and delayered management levels. We closed 16 offices in the U.K. and 4 offices in France and also closed our operations in Chile and Colombia. These restructuring exercises led to the redundancy of a number of employees including senior management and back-office positions. We also incurred a GBP 13 million exceptional charge in relation geared technology transformation and finance transformation programs, comprising both staff and third-party costs.\nDue to the ongoing nature of our restructuring and transformation programs, we expect to incur further exceptional restructuring costs in FY '26 as we expect to make significant growth towards our GBP 45 million per annum structural cost-saving ambition. Moving on to interest and tax. Our net finance charge for the year increased to GBP 3.4 million, driven by a $3.3 million increase in net banking trust payable due to higher average drawer Group's revolving credit facility. We expect the net finance charge for FY '26 to be circa GBP 12 million slightly below FY '25 due to the impact of the defined benefit pension buy-in and lower utilization of our revolving credit facility driven by working capital improvements. Our pre-exceptional effective tax rate improved by 270 basis points to 35.1%.\nThe higher ETR was driven by the geographic mix of profits together with the impact of tax losses in some country operations in H2 and the associated impact on deferred tax asset recognition. Post exacta basis, the effective tax rate was 620%, in which a $4.1 million tax credit in respect of exceptional items, was offset by a GBP 2.1 million tax charge arising from the derecognition of the deferred tax assets following the defined benefit pension buying. Based on our latest deal of profit, we expect the group's ETR for FY '26 to be circa 38%, consistent with the ETR from H2 FY '25.\nAt the current level of profits, the ETR remains sensitive both to the geographic mix of profit and also to the adjustments and deferred tax asset recognition expect the ETR to reduce as profit to rebuild over time. We delivered a strong cash performance in the year, cash from operations of GBP 128.3 million, up 14%. This represented a conversion of pre-exceptional operating profit into cash from operations of 281%.\nOur working capital inflow was GBP 58.1 million, driven by a reduction in temp fees and placements partially offset by an increase in debtor days to 37 days due to the greater resilience in our enterprise business costs, which have longer payment terms than the group average.\n[indiscernible] tax of GBP 12.9 million net interest of GBP 7.3 million. The cash impact of exceptional restructuring charges was GBP 29.9 million. Overall, this led to a free cash flow of GBP 78.2 million. On the right-hand side, the detail how we use the cash generated and the main items were the payment of GBP 47.8 million of core dividends, CapEx of GBP 22.7 million. and pension deficit payments of GBP 23.1 million, which includes the final payments of the full buy-in in December. We expect capital expenditures to increase to circa GBP 35 million in FY '26, driven by increased spending on our tech infrastructure, data and AI programs.\nDespite the slight increase in debtor days, we ended the year with cash of GBP 37 million. Although DSOs increased by 1 day year-on-year, they remain below pre-pandemic levels and our aged debt profile remains strong. Bad debt write-offs are in line with FY '24 and remain at historically low levels. During the year, we signed a new 5-year RCF facility at an increased level of GBP 240 million, with an option to extend by a further 2 years and at the same pricing as the previous deal. On this slide, we compare the balance sheet of June 2025 with prior year.\nThe most significant movement was the reduction of the defined benefit accounting surplus following the completion of the final scheme buy-in. The scheme's liabilities are now fully insured. We're moving all future risk and volatility from the group's balance sheet. Company pension contributions in the year were GBP 23.1 million, which comprised GBP 8.4 million in respect of normal pension debit contributions and GBP 12.6 million related to the full pension buying. In addition, we incurred GBP 2.1 million post buying admin costs. And we anticipate to circa further GBP 4 million post buying expenses and true-up costs through to the final scheme buyout, which is expected to be in the next 12 months.\nThe buy-in will drive significant free cash flow benefit for the group from FY '26, having removed the deficit contribution requirement previously costing circa GBP 18 million per annum cash funding. While our business model remains slightly cash generative with a strong balance sheet, based with the second consecutive year where our core dividend cover would be below our 2x to 3x target range. Together with an uncertain trading outlook, the Board has proposed a reduction in the final dividend payment that more appropriately aligns to the group's current level of profitability and affordability.\nThe final dividend proposed of 0.29 per share is calculated on a 3x FY '25 pre-exceptional earnings cover and applying our historic 1/3, 2/3 interim versus final split. This brings the full year dividend per share, and we expect to be at the higher end of the 2 to 3x cover range going forward.\nThe group maintains a clear capital allocation framework and priorities for the use of the group's cash flow going forward. These are to fund the group's investment and development requirements, remain a strong balance sheet, the core dividend that is affordable and appropriate. And return surplus cash to shareholders through a combination of special dividends and share buybacks.\nWe have, however, removed our GBP 100 million cash buffer to provide greater flexibility as our cash position rebuilds over the longer term. These declined by 11%, with challenging markets to persist, although we saw clear evidence of strategic delivery through the year. Volumes declined in both Tampa and Perm, although Tempa significantly more resilient.\nHowever, we have acted decisively both to manage costs and protect profits but also to better position the business going forward. Our structural cost reduction program surpassed our initial GBP 30 million per annum target delivered 2 years early. But we have more to do and our new and additional GBP 45 million per annum cost save target will materially improve the group's cost base over the long term. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet underpinned by our strong levels of cash conversion and we signed a new 5-year RCF facility in the year. The full pension buying significantly derisks our balance sheet and will drive long-term free cash flow benefit for the group.\nFinally, we have rebased the dividend and revised our capital allocation policy to provide greater balance sheet flexibility going forward. This will ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet, fund our long-term growth initiatives and generate attractive returns to shareholders. Despite the difficult trading environment, I'm confident our actions have better position Hays to benefit from the market recovery when it comes. Turning to current trading and guidance. July and August to date have been in line with our expectations with no significant change to trading momentum from Q4 in either Temp or [indiscernible]. September is our largest trading month of the quarter. and it is currently too early to assess trends. At a group level, there are no material working day effects in either H1 '26 or given our focus on driving consultant productivity. We expect overall group consultant headcount will remain broadly stable in Q1. We will also continue to deliver on our structural efficiency programs, which will further reduce our cost period through FY '26.\nOverall, our current capacity has significantly to deliver material net fee and profit growth when our key markets recover. I'd now like to hand back to Dirk to cover strategy.\n\nDirk Hahn\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jane. Our strategy is built upon 5 levers and is designed to build a structurally more resilient, profitable and growing business by our culture and talented colleagues worldwide. We will increase our exposure to the most in 1 shop categories, growing industries and end markets, higher skills and higher paid rolls, temp and contracting and large enterprise clients. Our strategy is not 1 size fits all, and we will tailor each region and create to its market and customer needs.\nWe will still scale in high-performing and high potential markets. and will scale back where forces are less supportive. And when markets recover, we will use our golden room to maintain a disciplined approach to consultant headcount investment. Despite challenging markets, we made substantial progress during the year. Consultant net fee product increased by 5%. Enterprise net fees grew by 8%. Net fees in Temp & Contracting were more resilient than perm and grew strongly in several focus countries.\nAnd as change [indiscernible] our structural cost savings are progressing very well. Let's examine this first 3 in more detail over the next slide. Consultant net fee productivity increased by 5% in the year by 6% in H2 and our growth has been sector-leading over this period. And if we adjust for our seasonal acquired second quarter, it has increased now for 3 consecutive quarters. Let provide you with a few examples why. In the U.S. Net fee productive decreased by 38% in FY '25, the country moved back to profitability from losses in the prior year.\nAfter an extensive revenue, our management team closed business units and offices where we lack critical mass and now has a highly focused [indiscernible] we were not satisfied our first half performance in the U.K. and took decisive actions to improve productivity and operational efficiency. Encouragingly, consultant net fee productivity increased by 9% year-on-year in and this drove a return to profitability in the second half. Technology and Enterprise Solutions were positive highlights with productivity up double digits, driven mainly by temp and contracting. And in Germany, following reallocation of compartments to more attractive business lines and selective exits, our net fee productivity growth accelerated to 8% year-on-year in Q4. I believe our market-leading productivity increase is proof that we are on the right track and are building at improved pace. I reminded you earlier, or 5 levers include the commitment to increase our exposure to large enterprise clients.\nWhere Enterprise Solutions business works with many of the largest companies in the world, often in multiple countries and specialisms. We provide recruitment and other HR services to both government and large organizations often delivered on the more complex and structural recons such as MS. Enterprise delivered a strong performance in the year with 8 net fee growth. Our positive momentum was supported by 3 factors. Firstly, we grew within exercise driven by headcount investment, higher fill rates and geographic expansion. Secondly, we secured new clients, including first-generation outsourcing opportunities and strategic wins from competitors. Our win rate has significantly improved over the last 2 years, driven by a growing repeat for expectant client service and enhancements to our deal qualification under a new global sales process. And thirdly, underpinned by our high service quality, we retained key contracts. 2 years ago, a new global sales process introduced our diligent approach to deal qualification, speed and consistency. As a result, our bid pipeline has become more focused containing fewer but larger opportunities with average e-value doubling over the last year.\nAnd our win rate percentage has improved from 1 in 5 in FY '24 to 1 in 3 in FY '25. Our fee suite engagement is in as we become a more strategic partner to our clients. We entered a new year with encouraging momentum and a substantial bid pipeline. We intended to improve our net fee mix over time by increasing our exposure to high-performing markets with the most attractive long-term structural growth opportunities in our core markets of temp contracting and term. Temp & Contracting were relatively resilient through the year, and the contribution to group net fees increased to 60% from 59% in FY '24, whereas per markets became increasingly challenging in most of our major countries. Temp and contracting net fees declined by 7% in our 2025 financial year.\nNet fee growth was positive in 5 of our 8 focus countries including notably strong performances in Spain, Poland and Italy. For example, Italy grew by 29% as our business line production and resource allocation initiatives generated attractive returns. Poland grew by 19% due to strong handling of large contracting accounts and an [indiscernible] MSP offering. And Spain grew by 16% and driven by a large new client win. We continue to forensically analyze our business lines to focus on those with the most attractive productivity and long-term growth opportunities.\nDuring the year, we exited business lines and closed operations in Chile and Colombia. I believe that changing business mix through our 5-lever strategy and in combination with the golden rule, is the foundation of our future success. Despite market headwinds over the year, we believe we have the right strategy and intent to relentlessly focus on execution to reposition and reshape our business. Firstly, we will continue to grow our business with high potential and high-performing business lines. We will scale back our exit business lines with full performance and potential and are further reviewing our country portfolio. Secondly, we exceeded our structural cost saving target 2 years ahead of schedule, and have now set ourselves the ambition of delivering a further GBP 45 million by FY '29 bringing total annual savings to GBP 80 million. These savings will be partially reinvested in our technology program. Which brings me to our final area of focus. We will continue to invest in our technology estate to harness the power of data and AI. This will provide the following benefits: improved net fee productivity as we provide our consultants with best-in-class tools and reduce administrative burden. Secondly, improved automation and efficiency in our back office. And finally, more powerful and personalized data and insights, enhancing our exceptional service to clients and candidates.\nOur investments will provide our consultants the best tools and drive a superior client and candidate experience. This is key for our future. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that delivering on our strategy will result in a structurally more profitable, resilient and growing business. It will also drive the return to prior peak profitability. Here are a few examples how Firstly, consultant productivity. A key long-term focus for management is growing consultant net fee productivity above inflation. The strongest driver of our sector-leading momentum in FY '25 was a more forensic analysis of our business lines to reallocate consultants to those with most attractive productivity. We will continue to optimize our headcount allocation and delivery models going forward. In addition, we will reshape our business to focus on higher skilled, higher pay growth and the most in-demand future top categories.\nAnd our data and AI investments will also support productivity growth. These factors will increase net fees with a potentially high drop to operating profit. Secondly, operational [indiscernible] As we mentioned earlier, we exited the year with GBP 35 million per annum cost savings and added ourselves the ambition of delivering a further GBP 45 million by FY '29.\nAnd finally, cyclical recovery. For nearly 3 years, activity has been relatively high with shop inflow per consultant, broadly in line with 2019 levels. So our consultants remain busy and have worked extremely hard. But lengthening time to hire has created a material track on the average number of placements per consultant and our profitability. We don't control the cycle, but eventually, client and candidate confidence will improve and the economy will recover. When it does, we will deliver a healthy drop-through to operating profit. So to growth, markets remain challenging in our 2025 financial year.\nAnd the Board and I are very grateful for the deep commitment shown by all our colleagues through the period. We are not assuming that the market becomes more supportive in FY '26. Therefore, we remain decisive and continue to focus on controlling the controllables. We are not satisfied with current levels of profitability, and intend to relentlessly focus on execution to reposition and reshape our business. We have the right strategy in place, and our FY '25 results provide evidence that we are making significant strategic and operational progress.\nI will now hand you back to the administrator, and we are happy to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Fred Wightman, Vice President, Hasbro Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nFrederick Charles Wightman\n\nAssistant VP & Analyst, Citigroup Inc, Research Division\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\nToday, we'll begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance, and then we'll take your questions.\nThe earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we're referring to earnings per diluted share.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.\nI'd now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today.\nBefore we begin today's call, I want to take a moment to honor the life and legacy of Alan Hassenfeld, our former Chairman and CEO; and the dear friend and mentor. Alan was a driving force behind Hasbro for decades. He led with heart, conviction and an unwavering belief in the transformative power of play. But more than that, Alan believed in people. He made it his mission to lead with empathy, to give generously and use Hasbro as a platform for doing good in the world. Alan reminded us that the true measure of our success isn't just financial performance. It's the positive impact we make on people's lives, especially the joy we bring every day to children around the world. Alan, you will be missed, but your vision and mission will never be forgotten.\nNow let's turn to 2Q results. We're now halfway through 2025 and already seeing momentum on our Playing to Win strategic plan announced in February. I'm pleased to report that Hasbro is performing ahead of expectations, driven by exceptional results from our Wizards of the Coast business, continued performance in our licensing and digital segments and a steady, long-term approach to navigating a complicated and evolving macro environment. While the broader consumer landscape remains dynamic, our play-focused partner scale strategy is paying off. leaning into premium, high-margin segments like Wizards, Licensing and Digital, and we're seeing it translate to bottom line outperformance.\nLet's break it down. Wizards of the Coast had a standout quarter. MAGIC: THE GATHERING continues to deliver growing 23% year-over-year in the second quarter and up 32% year-to-date. This isn't just a one-off moment, it's a clear indication of the power of MAGIC'S community, our release cadence and the resonance of our Universes Beyond strategy. MAGIC'S engine growth is durable. It's diversified and it's accelerating. We're seeing strength across every KPI of the brand. Tarkir: Dragonstorm is on pace to become the top-selling magic premier set of all time. Final Fantasy, the latest release in our Universes Beyond portfolio is already the highest grossing magic set ever. And Secret Lair, our direct-to-consumer collectible business just delivered the strongest sales quarter in its history. It's not just about our new releases either. Our backlist magic sets have already set an all-time annual sales record, and we're only 6 months into the year. That's a testament to the depth and durability of magic's value to players, collectors and fans alike, a play system of over 22,000 cards that retain full compatibility.\nCommunity engagement is also hitting new highs. Last month's Magic Con Las Vegas drew record attendance with over 19,000 badges sold, eclipsing our previous high from Chicago just earlier this year. And the Wizard's Play Network continues to expand, now totaling nearly 9,000 locations globally. Organized play is on fire. We saw a nearly 40% year-over-year increase in unique players during the first half of 2025. A clear signal that our play programs are bringing new energy and deeper connection to local communities Final Fantasy set a record for new player growth, delivering more new players in its first 2 weeks than any prior set posted over an entire season.\nFor the balance of this year, fans are eagerly anticipating our upcoming slate of releases, including Edge of Attorneys, Marvel's Spider-Man and Avatar: The Last Airbender, both new additions to our ever-expanding Universes Beyond portfolio. We're committed to scaling Magic through thoughtful innovation, smart operational execution and a continued focus on player-first experiences. We see a bright future for the brand, both in the second half of 2025 and beyond.\nTo simply put, Magic is stronger than ever, and we're just getting started. Sticking with Wizards, we're now in a place where we can start talking more confidently about our digital pipeline, a major investment area for both Wizards and Hasbro as we scale our ability to deliver play in new ways across more platforms with more partners. Exodus, our flagship AAA SiFi RPG from Archetype Entertainment is progressing well and is currently targeting launch in the second half of calendar 2026. This game represents a bold step forward into premium digital storytelling, and we'll be sharing a major update with players later this year. This quarter, we announced an exclusive publishing agreement with Giant Skull, led by industry veteran, STIG Amazon. STIG has an exceptional track record, and not coincidentally is the force behind some of my favorite games, God of War 3 and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to name 2 and is now leading the development of a brand-new single-player DUNGEONS & DRAGONS action adventure game. This is a premium title built from the ground up in our Unreal Engine Five, and we believe it will set a new bar for narrative and immersion in the D&D universe. This agreement reflects our planned win strategy in action, investing in top-tier talent, deepening digital engagement and expanding our presence in premium genres, whether it's Exodus, D&D or tapping into the amazing portfolio of collector and age-up oriented brands across Hasbro we're building a diverse, high-quality slate that strengthens our connections with fans and unlocks new growth for Hasbro's digital game portfolio. Starting at this year's game awards in December, you will be hearing a lot more from us.\nTurning to Consumer Products. As anticipated, sales were down in the quarter, particularly in North America, where our retail partners made a shift in ordering from direct imports to domestic given the uncertainty around tariffs over the last few months. We expect to make up much of this delayed ordering in Q3 and into Q4 as sales ramp into the holidays. EMEA and APAC are performing well, and we anticipate each of these regions will end the year in growth mode. While tariffs represent a headwind for the business, the current duties are better than the range we discussed in our last earnings call. We are compensating for these costs through a combination of cost reductions, rebalancing our marketing spend, diversifying our supplier mix and implementing some targeted pricing actions. Coupled with a strong slate of new toys, including PLAY-DOH Barbie, our new line of Peppa Pig toys, celebrating the birth of Peppa's little sister EV, retooled and reimagine board game favorites like Candyland and Operation, and Marvel Legend Series products tied to the upcoming Fantastic 4 release, we expect top line performance for consumer products to improve sequentially as we move through the balance of the year.\nLastly, our licensing business, which is embedded into our CP and Wizards segments continues to outperform. MONOPOLY GO! continues an impressive run of user and revenue milestones, proving to be an enduring hit from our partners at Scopely. We've just inked a new multiparty deal in casino gaming with Aristocrat Technologies, Valleys, Evolution and Galaxy Gaming. They joined SciPlay to form a 5 company partnership to expand our brands in a lucrative and high-growth market for digital on-premise gaming. And the balance of our LBE Consumer Products and digital gaming licensing business is both growing and providing an important source of high profit diversification. All of this adds up to a business that is showing strong signs of underlying momentum and meaningful progress against our Playing to Win objectives. While I won't steal much of Gina's thunder, based on the strength we are seeing across our diversified portfolio, especially for Magic, we are raising both top and bottom line guidance for 2025 and reaffirming our midterm outlook. 2025 will be the year of Hasbro returns to growth, and we will do so backed by record operating margins.\nI want to thank our teams across the world for making this possible. Our supply chain organization has done Yeoman's work, diversifying our supply chain while keeping costs low. Our sales teams are partnering with our retailers to navigate an unpredictable environment with agility and a long-term mindset. And our product, marketing and design teams are delivering some of the best new products and campaigns Hasbro has dreamed up in years. Alan would be proud.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Gina Goetter, our CFO and COO. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone.\nWe delivered a strong Q2 outperforming expectations on revenue, profit and margin, all while navigating a dynamic external environment. Our performance this quarter reflects the strength of our portfolio strategy, the outsized momentum in our Magic business and the disciplined execution behind our transformation and operational excellence initiatives.\nNet revenue came in at $981 million, essentially flat year-over-year on the strength of Magic. Adjusted operating profit delivered $247 million with an adjusted operating margin of 25.2%, which was up 20 basis points versus last year despite a material step-up in royalties expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share rose to $1.30, up 7% year-over-year, driven by favorable mix and margin discipline. Our Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment continues to be the growth engine. Revenue grew 16% to $522 million, led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which delivered 23% growth. Final Fantasy became the biggest magic set in our history, exceeding expectations, and attracting both long-time players and new fans.\nSegment operating profit was $242 million, with an exceptional 46.3% margin, reflecting both scale and disciplined cost execution. As expected, Consumer Products revenue declined 16% to $442 million, primarily due to retailer order timing and market softness in select geographies. As we foreshadowed last quarter, most of our U.S. retailers managed their discretionary inventory tightly through the quarter. While revenue declined, we improved margins, delivering near breakeven profitability through cost actions, mix and promotional spending discipline. Entertainment delivered $16 million in revenue in line with plan and $10 million in adjusted operating profit. The team continues to execute well against a leaner, more focused content portfolio. As we look at our year-to-date results, we are back to growth with revenue growing 7% versus last year behind the strength of Magic.\nOperating profit of $470 million is up 18% behind volume, favorable business mix and cost productivity. We remain intensely focused on transformation and cost leadership with $98 million of gross savings delivered through the first half. We are firmly on track to meet our annual target, reflecting strong execution across supply chain, G&A and product development. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA reached $576 million, up 19% behind the drivers previously noted. Through the first half of the year, we generated $209 million in operating cash flow and returned $196 million to shareholders via dividends. We've also bought back $62 million of debt as we work towards our target leverage ratio. Our teams are executing decisively against the evolving tariff backdrop. While the current China tariff rate is more favorable than what was proposed in April, rates remain fluid. Last quarter, we were modeling a broad range of potential outcomes with a net impact of $60 million to $180 million. Based on the updated trade policies with China at 30% and Vietnam at 20%, we are now estimating that we'll be at the lower end of the range and expect $60 million of expense in our 2025 P&L. We've incurred minimal tariff-related expense in our year-to-date results as most of the impacted inventory is still sitting on the balance sheet and is yet to flow through the P&L. Company-owned inventories are up versus last year, but reflects several factors, including tariffs, foreign exchange and a planned shift in revenue mix towards domestic fulfillment. We feel well positioned ahead of the retail seasonal inventory build and expect to exit the year slightly up versus last year. As a result of the impact of tariffs and our long-term outlook, we recorded a $1 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge in the Consumer Products segment this quarter.\nWe're also seeing downstream impacts from trade uncertainty across the retail landscape. Many retailers are delaying holiday inventory builds and pushed shelf resets into Q3, both of which weighed on Q2 consumer products revenue and are requiring us to remain agile in the second half. To that end, we've activated a comprehensive mitigation playbook, including SKU rationalization, sourcing diversification, pricing strategy and retailer collaboration to manage risk and preserve profitability. Today, approximately 50% of our U.S. toy and game volume originates from China, and we have plans in place to bring that exposure down to less than 40% by 2027 through accelerated geographic diversification. At the same time, we're identifying opportunities to onshore more production, including continuing to source from Elon Meadow, which manufactures most of our U.S. Hasbro gaming portfolio. These steps are strengthening our long-term supply chain resilience, while protecting margin performance. Based on our strong first half and improved visibility into the back half, we are raising full year guidance for revenue, margin and adjusted EBITDA. The upgrade reflects the continued strength of our Wizards business, confidence in our cost transformation efforts and a tariff impact that is now expected to be less significant than we had anticipated back in April. As Chris said, we are back to growth, and we now expect total Hasbro to grow revenue mid-single digits, and an adjusted operating margin of 22% to 23%. We are now forecasting Wizard of the Coast revenue to grow in the high 20% range, with an operating margin between 42% and 43%. The stronger outlook is driven by the record-breaking success of Final Fantasy, strong engagement across upcoming universe beyond sets like Spider-Man and Avatar: The Last Airbender and continued momentum in [indiscernible] titles and Secret Lair, all of which are reinforcing the durability and depth of the MAGIC franchise.\nIn Consumer Products, we now expect revenue to decline 5% to 8% for the year, with an adjusted operating margin between 4% and 6%. This revised guidance reflects the cost of the tariffs themselves, the revenue shortfall and operating deleverage in Q2 tied to changing order patterns and the anticipated impact from retailers shifting their holiday resets back as they adjust to a more fluid consumer demand environment. We are also on track to achieve $175 million to $225 million in gross cost savings this year and continue to prioritize investments behind our core growth engines while maintaining balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. As a result, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.17 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the strong first half execution, cost discipline and improved tariff backdrop. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in the business particularly behind high-return growth drivers like Wizards and Digital. Second, we remain focused on debt reduction and long-term leverage goals, including opportunistic debt repurchases and and pre-funding next year's bond maturity through match-dated treasuries. And third, return cash to shareholders via our dividend. As announced in today's release, we have kept the Q3 dividend unchanged.\nIn short, we delivered another strong quarter, beating expectations, expanding margins and strengthening our foundation for the second half. The MAGIC business continues to lead. Our portfolio is resilient, and our teams are executing with clarity and discipline. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our updated full year financial commitments and create long-term value for shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kristen Levy, Hasbro Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKristen Levy\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance, and then we'll plan to take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters.\nThere are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call. I'd now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Fred, and good morning. Q1 delivered another clear proof point of our playing to win strategy at work, play focused, partner scaled and performing. Revenue rose 17%, led by a surging MAGIC business and continued strength in licensing. Wizards was up 46%. Consumer Products was down 4%, driven by quarterly phasing due to a later Easter, but still ahead of plan. Both segments beat expectations. Adjusted operating profit jumped 50%, a result of favorable mix and the cost discipline embedded in our transformation program. Our games portfolio and industry-leading licensing business remains standout performers, high growth, high margin and structurally resilient due to lower exposure to international sourcing.\nOn tariffs, we acknowledge the challenge posed by the current global trade environment. While no company is insulated, Hasbro is well positioned. Our U.S. Games business benefits from largely digital or domestic sourcing, maintaining low COGS and healthy margins. We make many of our board games just up the road in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, not far away from where Milton Bradley printed his first board games in the 1860s. Wizards has low tariff exposure with sub-$10 million in expected duty for the year. Most of our domestic supply is produced in North Carolina and Texas with the balance from Kyoto, Japan.\nOur licensing business is primarily digital or minimum guarantee based with manageable partner exposure. While our toys segment faces higher exposure, we're responding proactively. Our asset-light sourcing model means we can rapidly shift production to help mitigate tariff impacts. We're accelerating our $1 billion cost savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally. While targeted pricing actions remain likely, we are prioritizing key price points and strengthening retail partnerships. We will work to capture market share and shelf space through our growth and optimize brands at critical consumer-friendly price points, particularly $9.99 and $19.99.\nWe want the hundreds of millions of families and fans we serve each year to keep experiencing unbeatable value at the shelf, whether it's an all-new home play set for Peppa Pig and her growing family, a play booster for Magic's Final Fantasy Universes Beyond collaboration or a hot new action figure for Marvel's upcoming -- fantastic 4 movie. We're also thinking long term as we play to win, especially with partners, a superpower of Hasbros. This week, we announced the extension of our multi-decade licensing agreement with Disney Consumer Products for Marvel and Star Wars. -- with enhanced category rights in Preschool, PLAY-DOH, Action and Roleplay.\nCombined with the Marvel agreement Match GATHERING, our collaboration with one of the world's most valuable brand portfolios has never been stronger. Expect more announcements of new partnerships with leading brands across toys, games and video games aimed at all demographics, further solidifying our position for long-term success. Looking ahead, while we remain hopeful for a more predictable and favorable U.S. trade policy environment, we must acknowledge the costs imposed by current tariffs. Even with Hasbro's relative strength and flexibility, logistics are becoming more complex and changes in receivables and shipping dynamics present a challenge.\nUltimately, tariffs translate into higher consumer prices. potential job losses as we adjust to absorb increased costs and reduced profits for our shareholders. Our guidance is unchanged, supported by our robust games and licensing businesses and our strategic flexibility, but prolonged tariff conditions create structural costs and heightened market unpredictability. Hasbro produces a substantial amount of product in the U.S. and around the world, has served as an engine of local jobs, creativity and innovation for over 100 years and licenses to hundreds of American companies employing tens of thousands of American workers across toys, games, entertainment, experiences and more.\nAs such, we fully endorse the Toy Association's advocacy for 0 tariffs on toys and games globally, either on U.S. exports or on imports. Other toy associations around the world are quickly joining the advocacy efforts. We believe there should be free and fair trade for toys, an industry critical not only to hundreds of thousands of American jobs, but also to the joy and developmental well-being of millions of children, families and fans across the U.S. and worldwide. Before handing it over, let me extend my sincere thanks to our team and partners.\nOur strong performance amid challenging conditions can be directly attributed to your dedication, agility and shared ambition. In an unpredictable environment, our greatest assets remain our people and our valued partners. They are what truly enable us to play to win. Now over to Gina.\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2025, delivering growth across revenue, profit and operating margin while continuing to execute on our strategic priorities. Our Q1 performance reflects early traction from our Play to Win strategy, ongoing transformation initiatives and a continued focus on cost discipline and profitable growth. Net revenue in the first quarter was $887 million, up 17% versus prior year, driven by growth in MAGIC and MONOPOLY GO.\nAdjusted operating profit increased 50% to $222 million, reflecting a 25.1% adjusted margin, a 5.5 point improvement over last year due to the favorable business mix. Adjusted earnings per diluted share rose 70% to $1.04, driven by top line growth, margin expansion and broader expense management. From a segment perspective, Wizards of the Coast in Digital Gaming once again led the charge. Segment revenue grew 46% to $462 million, with growth across both Magic Tabletop and digital licensing.\nMAGIC delivered a strong quarter with revenue up 45%, driven by healthy demand for recent releases and ongoing engagement in backless content. The strong performance in Q1 reinforces our confidence in the momentum and stickiness of the business across our core consumers. Our licensed digital gaming portfolio grew 56% in Q1, driven by MONOPOLY GO lapping the minimum guarantee for the final quarter. This game is now celebrating its second anniversary and has announced the next third-party IP collaboration with Lucas Films and Star Wars, launching in the game on May 1.\nOperating margin in Wizards reached 49.8%, up 11 points year-over-year, driven by mix and leverage from top line growth. Consumer Products revenue declined 4% to $398 million, finishing slightly better than our original expectations behind strength in licensing. Importantly, the segment's adjusted operating loss of $31 million improved 18% versus last year, and adjusted operating margin improved 140 basis points, reflecting progress on our cost transformation and lower promotional activity. Through the first quarter, we saw minimal impact from tariffs across our cost structure or customer order patterns.\nThe Entertainment segment declined modestly with revenue down 5% to $27 million, primarily due to deal timing. Segment adjusted operating profit held flat year-over-year at $17 million. Across total Hasbro, we continue to unlock savings from our transformation. Total adjusted EBITDA was $274 million, up 59% versus the prior year, with margin expansion supported by $22 million of gross cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives. On the cash side, we generated $138 million in operating cash, funded $52 million in strategic investments and returned $98 million to shareholders via our dividend.\nWe also paid down $50 million in long-term debt, keeping us on track to meet our gross leverage target of 2.5x by 2026. As we look at the remainder of the year, we're encouraged by the strength of our Q1 results and the early execution of our strategic priorities. That said, we're operating in a dynamic macro environment. The expanded rate on imports from China and potential reciprocal tariffs on other toy manufacturing hubs, including Vietnam and India, is creating volatility and introducing a range of scenarios for how the year could unfold. To stay ahead of this uncertainty, we're making targeted operational pivots.\nWe're further rationalizing our SKU portfolio to prioritize velocity and margin, reassessing our logistics routes and manufacturing to reduce exposure and accelerating efforts to diversify our sourcing footprint.\nToday, roughly 50% of our U.S. toy and game volume originates from China, and we're accelerating plans to bring that down meaningfully starting this year. China will continue to be a major manufacturing hub for us globally, in large part due to specialized capabilities developed over decades. In parallel, we're partnering closely with our customers to manage inventory flows and work through a range of pricing strategies tailored to different trade outcomes and protect key price points. These actions ensure we remain agile and margin-focused even as the external conditions evolve. With that context, let's turn to our 2025 total company outlook. We are pulling a lot of levers and making a number of puts and takes in our assumptions.\nThe net is we are keeping full company guidance unchanged. While we are dealing with a wide range of potential tariffs, retailer and consumer outcomes, our games business and our strategic flexibility gives us options. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes to unpack how we are modeling the cost of tariffs, impacts to the toy category, both in terms of retailer ordering and consumer takeaway and provide more color on our supply chain and pricing direction.\nOur forecast assumes various scenarios for China tariffs ranging from 50% to the rate holding at 145% and 10% for the rest of world. This translates to an estimated $100 million to $300 million gross impact across the enterprise in 2025 before any mitigation. As I mentioned, our team has moved quickly to offset activating a range of levers, including sourcing optimization and diversification, coordination with retail partners on SKU assortment and promotion activity and readying targeted pricing actions.\nWe've also modeled multiple scenarios around how the tariffs could impact our consumer products revenue, anchoring our assumptions to prior significant events, including the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession and COVID. Factoring in all the mitigating levers, we estimate that the net profit impact in 2025 to be between $60 million to $180 million. The range in outcomes is dependent on final trade policy, customer order patterns and consumer behavior.\nTurning to the Wizards segment. Given the broad-based strength in the Q1 results, we are raising our full year outlook and now expect revenue to grow mid- to high teens with a low 40s operating margin. This increase is driven by strong demand signals we're seeing across upcoming Universes Beyond releases, including Final Fantasy, Spider-Man and Avatar: The Last Air Bender. These sets are generating early excitement across both core and new fan segments, reinforcing the strength of our multi-franchise strategy. As we scale these tempo releases, it's important to note that we will begin to accumulate higher royalty expenses starting in Q2.\nThis is fully contemplated in our outlook and consistent with the broader strategy to grow high-margin franchise-led revenue across our portfolio and attract new and lapsed fans. The momentum in Wizards provides a strategic buffer as we navigate broader cost pressures in consumer products. At this stage, we don't have sufficient clarity to credibly adjust our full year consumer products guidance.\nThe range of potential outcomes tied to the evolving tariff environment remains wide, and we are continuing to assess the implications in real time. Until we see greater certainty on the scope and timing of these trade measures and how they could influence customer order patterns and consumer behavior, we believe it is prudent to leave our outlook unchanged while actively managing the levers within our control. As part of this, we're accelerating elements of our cost savings program, now targeting $175 million to $225 million in gross savings this year as we look for additional profit offsets.\nDespite macro uncertainty, a combination of CP mitigation, Wizards outperformance and accelerated cost savings gives us a line of sight to delivering on our full year financial commitments. Our capital allocation priorities for the year are unchanged. We continue to invest behind the core growth engines of the business, namely MAGIC and Digital Games, while maintaining discipline and flexibility in an evolving macro environment.\nIn light of current trade uncertainty, we are placing even greater emphasis on balance sheet health and liquidity. We remain committed to our long-term leverage targets and are taking a balanced approach to returning capital and prioritizing debt reduction. We have kept our Q2 dividend unchanged. To wrap up, as we move through the rest of 2025, we're executing with focus, scaling our high-margin growth engines, actively managing volatility and accelerating cost transformation.\nOur Q1 performance affirms the durability and advantage of our diversified model and gives us line of sight to delivering full year commitments even in a dynamic environment. We remain disciplined in capital deployment, responsive to external risks and confident in our ability to create value across the balance of the year.\nWe'll now turn it back to the operator to take your questions."

Chris?\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Fred, and good morning. Hasbro delivered another strong quarter in Q3, extending our growth trajectory in 2025. Net revenue and operating profit both showed robust year-over-year gains, underscoring the power of our Playing to Win strategy, which positions Hasbro as a diversified digitally forward play company uniquely resilient in today's tariff sensitive market.\nKey drivers were MAGIC, Marvel, MONOPOLY, PEPPA PIG, Beyblade and GI JOE. Brands exemplifying durable, diversified growth that differentiate Hasbro from traditional competitors. Year-to-date, revenue is up 7% and adjusted operating profit has increased 14%. We anticipate full year revenue growth in the high single digits and adjusted operating profit growth exceeding 20%. MAGIC continues to outperform expectations, posting 40% growth year-to-date. This success is fueled by unprecedented new player acquisition and standout collaborations with brands like Spider-Man and Final Fantasy.\nOur Universes Beyond strategy leveraging magic steps with beloved IPs is generating extraordinary engagement. Looking ahead, we'll build on this momentum in 2026 with original MAGIC IP SETs and blockbuster collaborations, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Hobbit, Star Trek, and Marvel Superheroes. Interest indicators like event attendance, search metrics, Magic Con participation, sales in new channels like mass and convenience and player growth are all at record levels.\nWe expect momentum to continue into the fourth quarter, fueled by upcoming MAGIC releases, including the Last Airbender and Final Fantasy's Holiday Set, alongside sustained momentum in Secret Layer and Backlist offerings. Wizards of the Coast is more than MAGIC. The refreshed 2024 additions of D&D's Monster Manual Players Handbook and DM Guide are off to the strongest ever start for D&D books. D&D Beyond's new accessible virtual tabletop has driven weekly traffic up nearly 50% since the September launch.\nMeanwhile, our digital licensing business, highlighted by MONOPOLY GO! and our recent launch of with Game Berry Labs continues to outperform with both games timing mobile player charts. In digital gaming, the game awards in December will showcase some new announcements from Hasbro, including updates on our upcoming Si-Fi RPG Exodus, further cementing our commitment to innovative digital play experiences. Consumer products met our Q3 expectations, although retailer shifts pushed some revenue into Q4. We anticipate a solid bounce back in the fourth quarter, driven by innovation, entertainment tie-ins and strategic partnerships.\nKey highlights include momentum from PEPPA PIG and Marvel's blockbuster content lineup, steady growth from Beyblade, GI JOE's rebound post supplier transition and solid traction for new products like Manimals, DJ Furby, Big EV, Star Wars, Lightsabers, Priorities and PLAY-DOH Barbie. Retail shelf resets since late August have led to a mid-single-digit POS increase entering the holiday season, and share gains Hasbro across our focus categories. We expect consumer products to finish the year down mid-single digits, primarily impacted by tariffs.\nHowever, because of our proactive supply chain diversification initiatives, we expect that by year-end 2026, no single country outside the U.S. will represent more than 1/3 of the Hasbro supply chain. Additionally, new vendor and manufacturing partnerships will unlock attractive pricing opportunities globally from Bodegas in Santiago to Dollar stores into Europe, expanding our retail footprint and total addressable market significantly. After a long turnaround effort, we expect Q4 to be the start of a long-term growth period for our toys business driven by innovation, a killer entertainment slate and new partnerships.\nJust this week, we announced an exciting collaboration tied to Netflix hit film KPop Demon Hunters. Product is expected to hit shelves in 2026, but for fans who can't wait preorders are already live for our MONOPOLY Deal Card game inspired by the film. In summary, Q3 reinforces that Hasbro's Playing to Win strategy is delivering results. We're confident in our ability to sustain long-term growth through diversified digital initiatives, strategic partnerships, and resilience against external pressures.\nBefore I close, I want to thank our incredible employees and partners around the world. Hasbro's return to growth is a direct result of your creativity, focus and belief in inspiring a lifetime of play. Now over to Gina.\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, outperforming expectations on revenue and profit while operating with discipline in a dynamic macro environment. Our results reflect the strength of Wizards ongoing cost transformation and continued progress toward our 2027 profitability goals. Net revenue in the third quarter was $1.4 billion, up 8% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in Wizards and steady execution across consumer products.\nAdjusted operating profit increased 8% to $356 million with an adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, holding steady versus last year despite increased cost pressure. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.68, down 3%, driven by a higher tax rate and FX impacts. Year-to-date, total Hasbro revenue is up 7% and adjusted operating profit has increased 14%, underscoring the strength of our diversified portfolio and the impact of our transformation efforts. The growth in MAGIC, coupled with sequential improvement in consumer products is fueling our overall financial performance.\nTurning to our segments. Wizards once again led our performance in the quarter. Revenue grew 42% to $572 million, with broad-based gains across both tabletop and digital. MAGIC revenue increased 55% to $459 million, driven by engagement with our Universes Beyond sets, our core IP edge of alternatives as well as continued momentum across secret layer and backlist products. Operating profit rose 39% to $252 million, delivering an exceptional 44% operating margin, reflecting the positive benefit of scale and mix within the MAGIC portfolio.\nConsumer Products navigated a complex quarter and the team demonstrated agility as we adjusted to delayed on-shelf dates from retailers, and lapped a difficult comparison last year in licensing. Revenue of $797 million was down 7% versus last year, with growth in Europe offsetting softer performance in North America. Adjusted operating profit was $89 million with an 11.2% margin compared to 15.1% last year. The margin change was driven primarily by tariff expense and unfavorable mix offset in part by productivity improvements across our supply chain and expense management.\nThe Entertainment segment delivered revenue of $19 million, up 8% and an adjusted operating margin of 61%, which is consistent with the asset-light model we're building in the segment. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA stands at $989 million, up 11% versus last year, demonstrating the combined impact of top line growth, operational excellence and disciplined investment. Year-to-date, we generated $490 million in operating cash flow, returned $294 million to shareholders via the dividend and spent $120 million on debt reduction through the combination of bond repurchases and prefunding our 2026 maturity via treasuries, a proactive step that provides flexibility while keeping us ahead of our long-term leverage targets.\nWe continue to see tangible benefits from our cost transformation efforts. Through the first 9 months, we delivered approximately $150 million in realized gross savings, keeping us on track to achieve our full year target. Operational efficiencies, expense management and productivity gains across sourcing and logistics are driving strong margin performance, even as we absorb higher royalty costs at Wizards and trade-related headwinds in consumer products. These savings are translating directly into margin resilience and giving us the flexibility to reinvest behind our highest return growth engines.\nWe're executing our tariff remediation playbook decisively to mitigate risk and protecting profitability. Maintaining our assumption that the China tariff rate stays at 30% and Vietnam at 20%, we continue to expect $60 million of impact in our 2025 P&L. Owned inventory levels remain healthy and firmly aligned with our year-end targets. We believe we have appropriate inventory in our warehouses to fulfill the anticipated holiday build and replenishment orders. With a robust entertainment lineup scheduled for 2026, we remain laser-focused on exiting the year with clean company-owned and retail inventories.\nWe are continuing with our diversification efforts to build resiliency across the supply chain, and coupling those with the incredible growth in MAGIC. By 2026, we expect approximately 30% of our total Hasbro toy and game revenue will be sourced from China and 30% of our revenue will be based in the U.S., as we opportunistically lean into our U.S. manufacturing capacity. As we enter the final quarter, our momentum remains strong, and we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect Hasbro revenue to grow high single digits with an adjusted operating margin between 22% to 23%.\nThis results in our adjusted EBITDA increasing to approximately $1.25 billion at the midpoint. For Wizards, we expect full year revenue growth between 36% to 38%, with an operating margin of approximately 44%. This improved guidance reflects the MAGIC over delivery in Q3 and sustained engagement and high demand through year-end releases. In Consumer Products, we are holding our latest guidance and continue to expect revenue to decline 5% to 8% year-over-year with margins between 4% to 6% as productivity works to mitigate cost pressures.\nOur capital allocation priorities are unchanged. And with our updated outlook, we will likely achieve our 2.5x leverage target at the end of this year. The Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share, consistent with our capital allocation priorities to return cash to shareholders. We remain focused on execution and operational efficiency in our core toy business. At the same time, we're thoughtfully investing for the future with a disciplined returns-driven approach, particularly in digital gaming and with strategic partners who help bring our brands to new audiences and categories.\nWe are on track to close the year from a position of strength, delivering profitable growth, deepening engagement in our most valuable brands and advancing toward our long-term financial and strategic goals.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions."

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call. I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Ken, and good morning. We closed 2024 with momentum, beating plan board, our Wizards of the Coast and Digital Games segment had another record year. We saw strong growth across our licensing business, and we delivered the best operating profit margin in company history, eclipsing 20%, including a return to profitability for our Consumer Products segment.\nWe began last year a healthier, stronger Hasbro with an improved balance sheet and operating structure outlining plans for greater cost savings and reinvigorating the company's innovation engine. We over-delivered, exceeding our guidance on nearly every metric, operating with renewed discipline that we believe positions Hasbro for multiyear growth and margin expansion.\nWizards of the Coast and Digital Games was up 4% year-over-year, with an operating margin north of 40%. As MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY GO! proved a potent 1-2 punch with both poised for continued growth in 2025. Wizards grew for the 14th time in the last 15 years led by a booming digital licensing business. MONOPOLY GO! maintained its high levels of engagement, capping the year with a star-studded TV campaign and success with its new Tycoon club.\nBaldur's Gate 3 saw solid use sales, nearly doubling our initial expectations. MAGIC: THE GATHERING had another impressive year. 2024 nearly matched 2023's record year despite fewer set releases. And the MAGIC ecosystem is as healthy and engaged as it's ever been.\nWe saw year-over-year increases in active players and MAGIC Con attendance and better-than-expected demand for several tent pole sets, including Q4's release foundations. MAGIC also exhibited beyond its 10 poles. We saw strong demand for backlist and secret layer, capping off the year with a record-setting Marvel offering, which sold out instantly.\nD&D relieved first significant update to Fifth Edition since 2014, and closed out the year strong with both the new players handbook and Dungeon Master's guide breaking records for the best-selling D&D books ever. [indiscernible] shared more about our video game future, including a new best-selling novel for Exodus by award-winning author, Peter Hamilton, a top-rated episode on the new hit Amazon Prime Game anthology series, Secret Level, exploring more about the Exodus universe, and our first gameplay sneak peak that has Sci-Fi video game fans buzzing.\nConsumer products licensing was a standout, led by My Little Pony trading cards and our out-licensed brands like FurReal Friends and Littlest Pet Shop saw POS lifts of over 50% in 2024, showing the value of our IP Vault and promise of our partnerships. The LEGO Ideas, Dungeons & Dragons Set [indiscernible] and is nominated for a Toy of the Year award.\nWe celebrated over 140 location-based entertainment experiences open around the globe, reaching our 50 million visitors annually, making Hasbro one of the most visited brand portfolios in the world. The momentum in our licensing business has been a huge catalyst for Hasbro, with a highly diversified and high profit revenue stream across over 1,000 partners driving over 4,000 individual collaborations.\nToy and Board Games finished the year on a much stronger footing. Our revamped innovation, marketing effectiveness and retailer alignment drove some nice wins for the holidays. One of the biggest was Beyblade, which saw demand acceleration in Q4 following media support and streaming content to the holidays. We also saw solid growth in TRANSFORMERS, following the animated movie TRANSFORMERS 1, strength in our Marvel Collector range and outperformance in preschool led by Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends.\nDiscounting was down for the quarter across the business. In fact, when factoring in a significant reduction year-over-year in inventory clearance, our mainline toy sales grew in the quarter, indicating momentum as we enter 2025. 2024 wasn't just a good year for Hasbro proving we can deliver. It also helped up the foundation for our new strategic plan Playing to Win.\nPlaying to Win focuses Hasbro on what has always made us great, play and partners. Through the power of our brands and breadth of our partnerships, we bring joint community to over 0.5 million fans across the world. Whether it's 40 theme park rides for Transformers, unique collectibles for [ gem in the holograms], Epic Quest with D&D, all new video games with GI Joe, or bankrupting [indiscernible] with a well-timed hotel on Boardwalk in MONOPOLY.\nOur focus on play and partners is clarifying. It has allowed us to exit noncore businesses like E1 film and TV, reduce our content budget by over 95%, while active production pipeline for Hasbro IP by 15% and take out over $600 million of costs from our P&L in the process.\nOur balance sheet is stronger. Our lineup of partnerships is the best it's ever been, and our focus has allowed us to lean into high-profit, high-growth areas like Digital Game, where our brands have proven resonance and our diversified digital revenue streams allows us to self-fund the efforts.\nPlay is the foundation for our incredible portfolio of brands, a library of thousands of spanning our 164-year history. From The Checkered Game of Life, created by Milton Bradley in 1860 to the first mass marketed toy in history, Mr. Potato Head, 1952 to cutting-edge video games like Baldur's Gate 3.\nWhat distinguishes us is the breadth and depth of our portfolio. Hasbro generates nearly 70% of our revenue in categories outside traditional toys for kids, games, digital licensing compounds, while we have powerhouse brands for children, over 60% of our audience is 13 or older, representing the lifetime fandom we create with consumers of all ages, whether it's collecting Spidey and Friends action figure, to completing your collection of super rare cards for MAGIC: THE GATHERING.\nOur audience diversity, the lifetime nature of our fandom and the diversification of our brand portfolio gives us conviction to invest in the future of play. As strong as our brands are, partners are the rocket fuel that helps them go supersonic. In the last 3 years, our licensing business has grown by 60%. Hasbro is the third largest entertainment licensor on the planet and the biggest in Digital Games, by far the fastest-growing entertainment category of the last decade.\nAcross Digital Games, occasion-based entertainment, and toys and merchandising partners, our brands are expected to see over $4 billion in incremental partner-led investments over the next 3 years. Our upcoming collaborations span blockbuster movies, themed hotels, cruise ships, quick-service restaurants, category-expanding toy partnerships and, of course, AAA video games. Our approach thrives on some of the most expansive inbound partnerships in the industry.\nToday, I'm pleased to announce 2 more. First off, today, we are unveiling an all-new licensing collaboration with Mattel, combining the creativity of PLAY-DOH with the empowering play of Barbie. PLAY-DOH Barbie allows children to unlock their inner fashion designer, creating PLAY-DOH fashions with amazing ruffles, bows and realistic fabric textures, all made with every kid's favorite dough for a never-before-seen creativity experience.\nSecond, we have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games. Hasbro and Sabre [ innovative ] will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024s megahit Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, combining high octane single-player action an amazing multiplay with SABRE's Swarm Tech. This new AAA title, one of our tentpole IPs is sure to be a hit.\nPlaying to Win is grounded in 5 strategic building blocks. First, Hasbro's unique advantage in aging up, driving play experiences for fans of all ages, whether it's through retail partners like Amazon, Walmart, Smiths or Target or via our growing direct initiatives, including Hasbro Pulse, Magic Secret Lair and D&D Beyond.\nSecond, leadership in digital play. We've been investing in video games for over 7 years through our portfolio of over a dozen projects in various stages of development, coupled with 100-plus licensing partnerships.\nI'm excited to show off our first project, Exodus to the world when we launch it in 2026. James Olin, the creative visionary behind Exodus has triggered of success. Serving as a design leader for Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 as well as the Creative Director during the golden age of BioWare who helped to helm the creation of the Dragon Age and Mass Effect franchises.\nOur third building block, everyone plays will drive Hasbro's expansion in fashion dolls and girls collectibles and leverage our much improved supply chain efficiency to better serve emerging markets and value channels globally. You'll see some early payoff in these areas from audience expanding play and collectible innovation later this year with some new announcements we have in store next week at New York Toy Fair.\nPartnership, our fourth building block will continue to be a huge part of our story with projects in the work spanning everything from new toy collaborations, new universes beyond partners with MAGIC, new video game partnerships, AI-enabled games and toys and major new location-based entertainment investments from partners around the world.\nOur fifth and most important strategic building block is profitable franchises. This doesn't mean just driving our brands through innovation and partnership. It means operating them with excellence from our supply chain to our managed cost discipline to our retail execution.\nAs part of this pillar, I'm pleased to announce we are increasing our cost target from $750 million by the end of 2025, a goal we are well on our way to achieving to $1 billion in total annual gross savings by 2027, with 50% flowing to the bottom line.\nPlaying to Win marks an important pivot for the company, a return to growth. In 2025, we are projecting modest revenue growth, coupled with continued margin expansion. Through 2027, we are projecting a mid-single-digit revenue CAGR with continued operating profit improvement. Powered by a killer entertainment slate, all nutrition and major launches from our multiyear digital investments. When we play to win, we play to grow.\nIn 2025, the first elements of our multiyear strategy will start to play out. MAGIC is poised to have its biggest year ever as we launched 3 Universes Beyond sets, starting with the blockbuster Final Fantasy in June. Featuring characters, items and moments from all 16 mainline games of the beloved series, Final Fantasy has the potential to be our biggest MAGIC release yet and we'll continue to drive best-in-class partner IP across the MAGIC play system with Spider-Man and a yet to be disclosed Universes Beyond set in the past. Stay tuned for more details at this weekend's MAGIC Con in Chicago.\nAnd going beyond cards, we expect Magic's reach to grow wider than ever through content like the newly announced animated Netflix series, and live action film and TV series from Legendary Entertainment.\nD&D is also set up to continue its recent momentum. This week, we released the widely anticipated 2025 Monster Manual with strong initial orders. We'll continue to build the D&D community, leveraging D&D Beyond as a marketplace. With many third-party publishing releases set for the first half, and the future of D&D's wider franchise ambitions is strong with all new video games and new entertainment on the horizon, including a new streaming series in development, the Forgotten Realms from Netflix and executive producer, Shawn Levy.\nAnd in Board Games, the team is focused on driving growth through redesigned classics celebrating MONOPOLY's 90th anniversary, including our all new expansion packs and bringing to market fun new family games like CONNECT 4 frenzy and [ rebounds ] that we're unveiling at Toy Fair next week.\nLast but not least, we have major new innovations across our toy portfolio, whether it's fun mashing collectibles, starting at $3.99 with Furby, amazing new action play with MixMashers allowing you to mix and match to customize your favorite Marvel, Star Wars and Transformer superheroes or exciting new water-based outdoor play with Super Soaker. Across price points, play patterns and age ranges, Hasbro is Playing to Win.\nPlaying to Win marks a new phase for Hasbro. One focus not just on cost discipline and improved profitability, but on growth and expanding our brands across new categories and new partnerships. Now I'll turn over the call to Gina Goetter, our CFO and COO, to share details on our 2024 results and provide guidance for 2025 and beyond. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2024 marked a year of significant improvement for Hasbro across several [indiscernible] and operational measures. It was a year of putting wins on the board and resetting the foundation and profitable portfolio.\nWe continue to grow revenue in Wizards while meaningfully improving the trajectory of our Consumer Products business. We eliminated complexity across our product portfolio and within our operations [indiscernible] to streamline our cost structure and maintain healthy inventory levels.\nThe actions we took at the end of 2023 improved our cost structure via lower shipping and warehousing costs, scale advantages across our suppliers and reduced inventory obsolescence cost. And we built new capabilities and design to value to optimize product design, ultimately driving down costs while improving the play experience.\nAltogether, we delivered $227 million of net cost savings and achieved a record operating margin. With an asset-light and operationally efficient business model, we strengthened cash flow, allowing us to reduce debt and return cash to shareholders with our category-leading dividend.\nLooking at our results mark closely, starting with total Hasbro revenue was $1.1 billion, down 3% excluding the [ E1 ] divestiture, including [ E1], revenue declined 15%. Wizards revenue declined 7%, with the decline almost entirely driven by having one fewer set release in the quarter. As Chris mentioned, the momentum on the core business remains healthy as evidenced by growth in backlist and Secret Lair. MONOPOLY GO! contributed $38 million of revenue behind robust player retention and marketing effectiveness.\nConsumer Products declined 1% behind exited brands and reduced closeout volume. We continue to see growth in licensing and benefited from lower promotional discounts across retailers. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $113 million for an adjusted operating margin of 10.2% over a 14-point improvement year-on-year, driven by the lap of recurring items, favorable business mix and supply chain productivity.\nQ4 adjusted net earnings were $64 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.46, benefiting from improved profitability and tax rate favorability. For the full year, total Hasbro revenue was $4.1 billion, down 7%, excluding the [ E1 ] divestiture, including [ E1], revenue declined 17%. The Wizards revenue grew 4%, benefiting from the success of MONOPOLY GO! and solid performance from MAGIC. The profitable mix of revenue, a record profit margin for Wizards at 41.8%, almost a 6-point improvement over last year.\nConsumer Products revenue was down 12% as growth in our licensed Consumer Products business was more than offset by exited brands, reduced closeouts and softer volume, namely across NERF and Star Wars. Despite this segment decline, we saw growth in several brands, including Beyblade, Furby and My Little Pony, and we continue to improve the profitability of the [indiscernible] a 6% adjusted operating margin or 6.7 point improvement versus last year.\nOn a reported basis, Entertainment segment revenue declined by 88% given the sale of E1. Absent this impact, revenue declined 4% and finished within our expectations. Total Hasbro adjusted operating profit was $838 million, up 76% versus last year, reflecting the lap of nonrecurring inventory costs, favorable business mix and cost savings.\nWe delivered $370 million of gross cost savings and $227 million of net cost savings and continue to track ahead of schedule, achieve the $750 million savings goal by the end of 2025. Adjusted net earnings of $563 million was up $214 million versus last year, leading to a $4.01 earnings per diluted share.\nOperating cash flow for the full year was $847 million, an improvement of $122 million, and we ended the year with $695 million in cash on our balance sheet, after investing about $200 million back into the business to support organic growth.\nAdditionally, we reduced debt by $83 million in Q4, bringing our gross leverage ratio to 3.2x adjusted EBITDA and our net debt ratio to 2.5x. We also returned $390 million of [indiscernible] shareholders via dividends.\nLooking to 2025 and beyond, we are excited to launch our updated strategy, Playing to Win, which is anchored in play and partnerships while continuing to drive additional excellence. Playing to Win is centered around 5 key strategic building blocks, targeted operational transformation initiatives and an investment framework that prioritizes spend and resources across our major brands, channels and markets to deliver strong financial returns.\nThe 5 building blocks that Chris described reinforce each other. And when coupled with our IP and improved capabilities drive a positive flywheel deserves to reinforce Hasbro's competitive advantage and positions us for growth. In this strategy, we are planning for the toy industry to be relatively flat over the next 3 years with growth peaks driven by strength in the broader entertainment slate.\nEmerging market growth and aging up of the consumer will influence our innovation priorities and the broader video gaming market will continue to accelerate, driven by the next generation of console releases. Through Playing to Win, we expect Hasbro's business mix to continue shifting aligning more with how we see the future of play patterns.\nWe expect through 2027 that our digital and partner-driven licensing will represent about 1/4 of the corporate revenue mix. We also expect the broad definition of gaming to grow its contribution to our revenue mix through this period, including board games, trading cards, digital licensing and video games.\nThis combination of growing high-margin revenue streams, while our brand scale through partnerships will sustain our investment towards our biggest opportunities, including MAGIC and self-publishing video games, as well as continue to support the innovation pipeline for toys.\nAs we think about the major brands, channels and markets in which operate, a new prioritization framework will ensure we're driving the best returns on our investments. Growth brands with the highest growth in margin potential like MAGIC and PLAY-DOH and new business opportunities like our self-published video games, including 2026's released, Exodus, who will receive higher incremental investments.\nOpportunities with a lower growth or margin profile, we'll see more targeted investments to maintain share and optimize profitability. And for brands like NERF, which are facing structural category headwinds, the focus will be towards reinventing the business model to ultimately put it on a path towards renewed profitability.\nIn addition to having the right strategic building blocks and prioritization framework in place, it is also imperative we maintain operational rigor and continue to transform the business. We have multiple initiatives underway across the organization, including the continued modernization of our IT and back office systems to speed up decision-making and reduce costs, improving the agility of our design process to bring products to market faster and the evergreen initiative of driving supply chain cost productivity inflation.\nThe transformation we have driven over the past 2 years has put us well on our way to hitting our goal of $750 million of gross cost savings through 2025 and we now have line of sight to reach $1 billion in savings 2027. This step-up is a result of changing how we work and building on the significant progress we have already made with supply chain.\nThe expected cost savings, coupled with a pivot back to revenue growth, will drive healthy profit and cash flow, allowing us to stay committed to our capital allocation priorities of investing in the business, paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders via the dividend. As cash flow increases in 2026 driven by video game monetization, we will create the opportunity for an even more balanced capital allocation framework.\nTurning to guidance for 2025. We expect total Hasbro revenue to be up slightly year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total Wizards revenue is forecasted to grow between 5% to 7%, driven by expected strength in MAGIC on the back of 3 Universes Beyond set releases. Given this set timing, we expect stronger growth quarters in Q1 and Q4.\nLicensed digital games will be flat as contributions from a full year and MONOPOLY GO! will offset the moderation of Baldur's Gate 3. Wizard's operating margin will be between 39% and 40% and with a step down from last year, largely driven by the income royalty expenses for Magic Universes Beyond [ tentpoles ] sets.\nConsumer Products revenue will be flat to down 4%. This includes a roughly 4-point headwind from 2 businesses: NERF, due to the structural category declines and Star Wars on the back of a light entertainment slate. We expect closeout volume to be relatively flat year-over-year and exited brands will not be a material headwind.\nFrom [ a thing ] standpoint, primarily due to late Easter, we expect Q1 revenue to be down mid- to high single digits before demonstrating sequential year-over-year improvement. Products operating margin will be between 8% and 10%, with a step-up driven by ongoing cost savings. Given the volume stability across most business lines, we expect to see minimal impact from volume deleverage.\nEntertainment revenue is expected to be flat with an operating margin of approximately 50%. Total Hasbro adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion, the increase versus last year is primarily driven by the continued profitability improvement in consumer products.\nOur guidance includes the anticipated invest tariffs on imports from China and potential tariffs on Mexico and Canada as announced on February 1. It also reflects mitigating actions we plan to take, including leveraging the strength of our supply chain and potential pricing.\nWe also continue to diversify our manufacturing footprint to create optionality as we navigate the trade environment, and we are on a path to move from 50% of our U.S. toy and game volume originating from China to under 40% over the next 2 years.\nWe expect to spend approximately $250 million in project capital with half to support our internal video game development and the balance to support organic growth in toy as well as the various transformation initiatives across the organization. We expect operating cash to be roughly flat and to sufficiently fund our existing capital allocation priorities. And the Board has declared our next quarterly dividend payable in March.\nAs we look to the Playing to Win strategy out beyond 2025, we expect total Hasbro revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit growth rate from 2025 through 2027 with the acceleration driven by momentum in MAGIC, a stronger entertainment slate in toys and the launch of internally published video games, starting with Exodus in 2026.\nWe expect Hasbro operating margin to expand on average by 50 to 100 basis points annually with the favorable revenue mix shift improve toy profitability and continued cost savings towards our $1 billion goal. We also expect to reach our gross leverage target of 2.5x or better by 2026. And through a combination of debt paydown and EBITDA growth.\nIn closing, after significant progress in our turnaround over the last 2 years, Hasbro is stronger, focused and ready to execute our latest strategic plan. We have developed a strategy that capitalizes on our unique strengths and market advantages and is focused on creating profitable growth that positions us to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nSpecial thank you to all of our employees, partners and customers for your thought leadership and partnership as we turn the page to this next chapter and play to win. And with that, we will take your questions. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to [ Ken Kapor ], Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nhank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance. Then we will take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters.\nThere are many factors that could cause actual results or events materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.

I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks [indiscernible] For the past several quarters, you've heard us reaffirm Hasbro's strategy to refocus on play with our fewer, bigger, better principles. In our Q1 results, we're seeing Hasbro's strategy come to life. We are applying a franchise-first mindset. We're realizing our brands' potential through licensing with success across digital and consumer products. And we're continuing to invest in innovation across toys and games, appealing to consumers of all ages across play patterns. We began 2024 with a healthier balance sheet, a leaner cost structure and an improved inventory position.\nIn Q1, we saw tangible progress on our turnaround. Our revenue landed as expected, and our margins outperformed. While most of the year remains ahead of us, I'm glad to see the business is on a solid track. It gives me confidence Hasbro's pointed towards sustainable, long-term growth backed by industry-leading innovation across games, toys and partner-led entertainment [indiscernible] Digging into the quarter, there were several highlights. Let's start with licensing.\nMONOPOLY GO! from our partners at Scopely has crossed over $2 billion in lifetime revenue and $150 million downloads, breaking records as the fastest-growing mobile game ever. Baldur's Gate 3 from our partners at Larian Studios, continued its momentum from last year with even more recognition. It's now the only game to ever win all 5 prestigious game words. While the success of Baldur's Gate 3 is in a league of its own, we see a long-term opportunity to leverage the richness of D&D across more games.\nIn Q1, we signed new licensing agreements with resolution games best known for the VR game demo as well as Gameloft, makers of Disney Dreamlight Valley, both to build within the D&D universe. And [ at ] D&D 50th anniversary, we executed new partnerships with LEGO, Converse and Black [ mill ] apparel. Dungeons & Dragons Red Dragon Tail is a 3,700 piece fan favorite that combines the building fund of LEGO and the Rich World building of D&D. I can't wait to build my own. Our success in license ends to our toy brands. We saw positive early results in Q1 from LITTLEST PET SHOP, now manufactured and distributed by basic fund. And just this week, we announced a strategic relationship with Playmates to produce and distribute power rangers to starting in 2025.\nThese are high-profit partnerships that leverage great partners with iconic brands from our extensive IP vault. Our new asset-light entertainment model ready paying dividends. We look forward to bringing the Star setted animated zone TRANSFORMERS 1 to theaters this September with our partners at Paramount. In Q1, we announced deals with Lionsgate and Margot Robbie's production company, Lucky Chap, to produce a live-action monopoly movie as well as with the CW to create game shows around trivial pursuits and scrabble. And of course, I can't wait to see what Sony has in store for us. with the just announced film and TV projects for Clue. The movie was a favorite of mine in the 1980s.\nAnd our success in asset-light partner-based entertainment extends well beyond the screen. We now [indiscernible] has rebranded partner-led properties, bringing in over $55 million last year alone. We see those figures increasing significantly over the next couple of years as our partners bring our brands to life through thrilling experiences and attractions and billions of dollars of third-party capital investments with quality executions like Hasbro City in Mexico, which we've just awarded the best family entertainment center in the world by the International Association of [indiscernible] and attractions.\nConfigurating our innovation and driving operational rigor underpins our turnaround. In games, we continue to make changes within our board games portfolio, opening the door for share gains in growth categories like party, strategy and card games. In Q1, we launched Life [ and ] Ratera, a [ tile link ] strategy game from a claim designer, Eric Lang; and [ Fork Milk Kidnab ], a fun new adult party game. We also are doubling down on where we are the clear leader. In February, we launched the second edition of [ Prism ] NBA board game at the NBA All-Star weekend, and it helped make Monopoly the #2 growth property in the games category in the U.S. for the quarter. We expect to see more crossover opportunities for the brand and sports in the future.\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING saw healthy growth in Q1, driven by timing of sales for our latest release outlaws thunder junction and strong demand for fallout Commander. Q2 is an important quarter for MAGIC, with the outlies in [indiscernible] 3, what we expect to be our biggest set of the year. While we expect MAGIC to be down for the year after a record 2023, we maintain our long-term bullishness on the brand based on the continued robust fan engagement and a killer lineup of new universes beyond collaborations, including upcoming 2025 for Final Fantasy and Marvel. And stay tuned for more exciting innovation from our D&D team as we continue to scale D&D Beyond and expand the richness of tabletop gameplay to digital. We expect to connect to an even wider audience while delighting our existing fans as D&D celebrates its 50th anniversary.\nFinally, let's turn to toys, where our turnaround efforts are well underway. We began Q1 with inventories at multiyear lows, down over 50% from the prior year. As a result of our cleanup efforts, we saw a significant reduction in closeout volume in thanks to our operational discipline and careful SKU management. We're in a good position with our large retail partners as we work towards new product innovation, including [ Bayblade NERF ] and refresh lineup for [ BabyLive ]. We also are seeing solid progress in revamping our approach to marketing, significantly shifting our mix to digital, driving stronger-than-ever partnerships with our e-commerce and multichannel partners like our just completed birthday shop with Walmart, and are seeing improved return on advertising spend as a result.\nWe continue to see momentum with Furby, one of last year's top new toys, including our latest best seller, [ furblades ]. According to [ Sircana ], these Buzzy little friends were the top-selling item in the special feature plush category in the U.S. And earlier this week, we announced [indiscernible] the dark [ Furby ] Galaxy coming this summer. We've also seen encouraging POS trends from Transformers as we celebrate the brand's 40th anniversary. While we're lapping last year's successful film transformers Rise on the [indiscernible] in Q2, we look forward to sales rebounding in the back half as we gear up for Transformers 1.\nLast but not least, our retail and licensing partnerships are among our most important. Last month in New York City, Hasbro and Amazon collaborated with the Walt Disney to create a Star Wars experience at their first ever March to May 4 event. Through an immersive retail experience in the main floor of the Empire State Building, fans were able to take photos with costume characters, including [indiscernible] checkout Hasbro's latest Black Series helmets and [ CyberCor ] light sabers collectibles.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to highlight the recent changes to our Board of Directors, bringing in new members with extensive games and retail operations experience. I'd like to welcome Darren Frank and [ Owen ] to the board. I also want to thank [ Tracy, Linda ] and Michael, who will be retiring from the Board following our shareholder meeting next month. I'm grateful for their support in the past few years. And lastly, [indiscernible] [ Alan Hassenfeld ], who will be stepping away from his role as Meredith Chairman. [ Alan ] has been and always will be a prominent architect of Hasbro's legacy, and he will continue to be engaged with Hasbro guiding the company's philanthropic efforts providing development and relief for children around the world.\nTo recap, it was a good quarter. We landed revenue where we expected with wins across digital licensing, board games and continued momentum for Furby. We continue to sharpen our execution, staying within our guardrails and inventory and delivering meaningful cost productivity across the P&L. While it's still early, our turnaround efforts in consumer products are going well. and we look forward to monitoring our progress over the next couple of quarters. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina to share more about our detailed results and guidance for the year. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In February, I outlined our strategy to build on the foundation we put in place last year after resetting the business and the necessary steps we're taking to reinvigorate innovation across the portfolio while continuing to drive operational rigor. I am pleased with how we executed in the first quarter [indiscernible] strength in digital licensing and MAGIC contribute to our profitable business mix while our turnaround efforts in toys started to take shape. We continue to deliver supply chain productivity ahead of inflation, and we [indiscernible] progress on reducing operating expense.\nWe see more of our cost footprint lower as we further refine our supply chain and optimize line across each brand. We have already identified significant savings through the design-to-value strategy with our teams leveraging customer insights and competitive analysis to inform our actions. Looking at our toy turnaround in more detail. While Q1 represents the smallest contributor to full year sales, we maintained our controlled [ Samson ] inventories after the cleanup efforts last year. We ended Q1 with inventory healthy levels, down over 50% from a year ago and roughly flat to where we ended in 2023. Our number of days in inventory were at multiyear lows for Q1 and at around 66 days.\nAnd while we expect to see our inventory days increase over the next couple of quarters in line with normal business seasonality, we are still planning for total owned inventory levels to finish the year relatively flat versus 2023. Our much improved inventory position led to over 50% reduction in closeout sales in the quarter. And although this negatively impacted our Consumer Products segment revenue growth, we did realize a margin benefit from the improved sales rate, and we expect this trend to continue as we move through Q2.\nWhile improving the profitability of toys and delivering our cost savings target are 2 of the company's top priorities, I want to emphasize that we are concurrently staying vigilant around what investment opportunities require incremental spend to drive the most profitable revenue across the portfolio. Through greater analytics, we are already seeing an improvement in our marketing efficacy, and this is an area we will lean into as we ramp our innovation across toys and games and prepare for a stronger holiday season. Moving now to our Q1 financial results.\nTotal Hasbro revenue was $757 million, down 24% versus Q1 of last year. If you exclude the impact of the E1 divestiture, total revenue was down 9% versus a year ago. Growth of 7% in our Wizards of the Coast segment, led by MAGIC and licensed digital games and 65% growth in entertainment, driven by a renewal deal for [ Peppa ] Pig, was more than offset by the 21% decline in consumer products, driven primarily by category declines and reduced volume moving through closeout. Q1 adjusted operating profit was $149 million, with an operating margin of 19.6%, up about [ 15.0 ] points year-over-year. This improvement was largely driven by a reduction in costs stemming from our operational excellence program as well as supply chain productivity gains and favorable business mix. including the E1 divestiture. In aggregate, we were able to deliver significant margin improvement despite ongoing volume deleverage across our toys business.\nTotal Hasbro Q1 adjusted net earnings were $85 million, with earnings per share of $0.61, driven by the improvement in operating profit as well as favorability from a stock compensation adjustment and net interest expense reduction. Operating cash flow was $178 million, an $89 million improvement over the same period last year, driven by the increase in net earnings as well as reduced production expense in connection with our sale of E1. We gave back $97 million to shareholders through the dividend and ended the period with $570 million of cash in our balance sheet. Now let's look at our 2 major segments in more detail.\n[ With ] Wizards of the Coast in digital gaming, revenue grew 7% ongoing digital licensing contributions from [indiscernible] and MONOPOLY GO!, which as a reminder, neither recorded revenue in Q1 of last year. We also saw growth in Magic tabletop revenue, benefiting from shipments for our latest set release outlaws of Thunder Junction, which arrived in stores last week as well as in to our follow-up from [indiscernible] Operating margin for the segment finished at 38.8%, up 13 points year-on-year, driven by supply chain productivity, cost savings and improved business mix, given the growth in digital licensing. Turning to Consumer Products.\nThe total revenue decline of 21% was mostly driven by broader market softness [ our key ] brands exacerbated by a reduction in closeout volume following our inventory cleanup efforts in Q4. We also saw some modest impact from our exited brands as well as a timing-related headwinds within our direct-to-consumer platform, Pulse, which is lapping a strong product offering in Q1 of last year. The volume decline was in line with our expectations and resulted in an improvement in our gross to net sales rate, reflecting a more disciplined stance around discounting, which we expect will continue to benefit the CP segment profitability as volumes recover.\nAs Chris mentioned, we saw some bright spots with the recent launch of FURBY as well as with PLAY-DOH and Hasbro Gaming. And conversely, we had continued softness in the blaster category, which negatively impacted NERF as well as action figures due to the light entertainment slates and lapping last year's successful launch of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. Operating margin for Consumer Products came in at negative 9.2%, which is down roughly 2 margin points last year. As expected, we saw a material impact from deleverage associated with the volume decline which was partially offset by [indiscernible] productivity gains, managed expense savings and improved gross paying rate due to lower closeout volume. It's important to note that the CP gross margins grew by over 5 margin points demonstrating the improvement in the underlying profitability of the business despite the negative impact from deleverage. Turning to guidance for 2024.\nWhile we are pleased with our Q1 progress, we recognize that the quarter represents a small portion of our full year sell-through for toys, and we want to monitor throughout Q2, our progress in wizards, particularly in digital licensing and magic before potentially revising our outlook for the full year. So at this time, we are reaffirming our initial guidance and this calls for total Wizards revenue to be down 3% to 5%. The decline is primarily a result of the strong growth delivered in 2023. Within Wizards, we continue to plan for licensed digital games to be relatively flat versus last year, with contributions from Baldur's Gate 3 tapering down as we move through the year. For MONOPOLY GO!, we are still planning to record the contract minimum guarantee first half of the year, and we'll continue to watch the data closely as we move through the second quarter.\nIf the current trends continue, [indiscernible] to book above the minimum guarantees sooner than the second half, but at this time, we are holding our initial guidance. Wizards operating margin will be between 38% and 40%, up 2 points from last year, driven by the favorable mix shift within digital, lower royalty rates subject and strong cost management, both in supply chain as well as within operating expenses. For Consumer Products, revenue will be down at 7% to 12%, and operating profit margin will be between 4% and 6%. As a reminder, about half of the revenue is due to actions we've taken to improve profitability, and the other half is due to prevailing category turns. We continue to expect a similar revenue decline in Q2 as we saw in Q1 with the pace of decline moderating in Q3 and flipping to growth in Q4 behind sharper innovation and marketing effectiveness as well as healthy retail inventory levels heading into the holidays. However, we expect to see profitability as we move through the year as we build volume ahead of the holidays, and we realize more of our net cost savings.\nAdjusting for the impact of the divestiture revenue will be down approximately $15 million versus last year, and operating margin will be roughly 60%, up significantly driven by operating actions as well as lapping the impact of the D&D movie impairment in 2023. We remain firmly on track towards our target of $70 million of gross cost savings by 2025. And given the results in Q1, we are on pace to deliver $200 to [indiscernible] of net cost savings in 2024. We continue to expect total Hasbro EBITDA in the range of $925 million to $1 billion, driven by our cost savings and the lap of nonrecurring inventory cleanup charges taken last year which will more than offset the revenue decline and cost inflation. Lending cash will be slightly down versus 2023, driven by relatively flat owned inventory levels, increased capital project spending and the costs associated with the restructuring actions announced in December. And from a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities remain to first and the core business. Second is to return cash to shareholders via the dividend, and third, to continue progressing towards our long-term leverage targets and pay down debt.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Chris to wrap up.\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Gena. We're pleased with quarter performance. We're doing what we said we would do, driving a shift in games in licensing, fixing our toy business and lowering our costs. It's still early, and we have lots of there to go, but I think it's fair to say this was a good start to the year. We'll now pause to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kern Kapoor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKern Kapoor\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance. Then we will take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters.\nThere are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in other public disclosures.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.\nI would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian P. Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kern, and good morning. Q2 was another good quarter. We saw strength in gaming and digital licensing and landed where we expected within consumer products, while increasing operating margin and maintaining healthy inventory. It's nice to come into calls like this and not only deliver what we said, but to start making it a habit. Across games, IP and toys, Hasbro is merging a more profitable, agile and operationally excellent company, one dedicated to delighting fans of all ages through the magic play.\nOur licensing and IP business continues to be a differentiator for us. In digital, we're seeing megahits like MONOPOLY GO! demonstrate staying power. We have over 35 entertainment projects in development, and our team continues to drive our IP within consumer products through partners spanning the globe in multiple categories. And as we look at the business of play, it's clear that digital is here to stay in a bigger factor than ever and how successful toy and game companies will grow and strengthen their brands. We're years ahead of our peers, having already spent hundreds of millions of dollars building out our own studio capacity and expanding our brands through digital partnerships, games like Baldur's Gate 3 show us what the future looks like.\nAnd while we're still in the middle of the ballgame on our turnaround efforts in toys, we're seeing signs our innovation is working, particularly where we have a big head start versus the competition. Many companies in the toy and game industry are waking up to the power of fans and the importance of \"kid oats\". Hasbro's long appreciated this audience, driving over 60% of our revenue from consumers 13 and older and we'll continue to lean in here as we think about innovation across our product portfolio.\nLooking at the business with first half of the year in the books, our team delivered, and we're raising our full year guidance as a result. Gina will share more detail shortly, and I'll first offer some business highlights across gaming, licensing and toys. We had another solid quarter from MAGIC: THE GATHERING on the back of this year's blockbuster set release Modern Horizons 3 facing a high bar with last year's Lord of the Ring's universes beyondset, Modern Horizons 3 has had a strong start, becoming the fastest selling set in MAGIC'S history. While we expect a tougher comp in the back half for MAGIC following the strong first half and as we lap a greater number of releases last year, we're seeing good early interest in our first tentpole set, [ Bloomboro ], releasing next week.\nAnd then in 2025, we anticipate a return to growth for MAGIC driven by 2 universes beyond sets for Final Fantasy and Marvel that fans are already eagerly anticipating. Within D&D, we're seeing solid preorders for the 2024 core rules book for the revised and expanded fifth edition. D&D all shows how we're increasing digitization across our portfolio. Digital revenue already accounts for over half of the mix due to the success of D&D Beyond. Next week at GenCon, fans can expect to see more of our 3D role-playing sandbox experience built on Unreal Engine V bringing Flay's favorite franchises to life across PC, console and mobile.\nWe look forward to getting it in gamers' hands later this year. D&D Beyond already represents our largest direct-to-consumer platform with 18 million registered users. Along with polls, our destination for exclusive collectibles across fan favorite brands like G.I. Joe and Star Wars, we see an opportunity to unlock more value across our Hasbro Direct business. Licensing was another standout in the quarter. Momentum in MONOPOLY GO! from our partners at Scopely continued into Q2, accelerating our revenue recognition beyond the minimum guarantees and driving healthy upside to both revenue and operating profit.\nSince launch, the game has grossed over $3 billion in revenue. And as we are the top licenser of video games over the past year, according to Al Dora. The team continues to have an active pipeline of licensing opportunities across PC, console, mobile and casino, leveraging our rich IP. In Q2, we announced a new arcade-style game for Power Rangers with our partners at Digital Eclipse. And just this month, we kick off the Transformers Overwatch to crossover. As we continue to invest in our digital gaming efforts, both through partnerships and self-publishing through our own studios, I'm excited that John Hight, former SVP and GM of the Warcraft franchise for Blizzard Entertainment is joining Hasbro as President of Wizards of the Coast.\nJohn is a lifelong MAGIC and D&D fan and bodies Hasbro's mission to bring people together through play. Within Consumer Products Lighting, we saw growth in the quarter, helped by our new partnership with [ Kayo ] collectible trading cards building on the resurgence of MY LITTLE PONY in China, and LITTLEST PET SHOP international appeal continues to grow. Rank is the #2 growth property in place at dolls and collectibles across the G10 according to [indiscernible]. We also launched several partner-led Hasbro branded [indiscernible], including a new Peppa Pig theme park in Germany, as well as the game room and Planet Play school in New Jersey, combining for 60,000 square foot of games and STEM-based play experiences.\nFinally, turning to toys. As a reminder, we began the year expecting the first half for consumer products to look similar to last year's second half. Through Q2, we've landed where we thought we would and I'm encouraged by several early reads, notably Beyblade. After a strong launch in Japan, we've begun rolling out Beyblade globally. We've seen positive early demand with fans liking the streamlined brand assembly and new accelerator rail stadium that creates epic collisions. And in this year, wider entertainment content as rose well positioned with the biggest movie for toys coming to theaters this September, TRANSFORMERS 1 with our partners at Paramount.\nWe have strong retail alignment and the early demand for our fan SKUs to celebrate the brand's 40th anniversary. You can expect renewed innovations in some of our core toy properties as we head into back-to-school. PLAY-DOH has shown strength all year, and we've gained valuable insights from our digital marketing efforts in the spring that we'll be applying to the fall. We're expanding play styles with new launches like the first ride on pizza delivery scooter and aging up with PLAY-DOH Marvel action figures in partnership with the Walt Disney Company.\nThis fall, we'll also be ramping our [ latest series ], which features a proprietary nerve dart. Retailer support has been strong since last month's launch. Our people and culture are critical to the successes I've highlighted during this call. And so before I wrap up, I want to also welcome back Holly Barbacovi, an HR Powerhouse, who's bringing her pragmatic approach to HR back to Hasbro as our new Chief People Officer.\nTo recap, it was a good quarter with solid performance and profitability, led by our strength in gains and licensing. Toys came in as expected, and we see a path to growth in Q4, driven by innovation and strong alignment with our retail partners. We still have most of the year left to go and we'll be watching back-to-school closely. But our team's work is starting to make a real difference, and we feel confident in taking our guidance up for the full year.\nI'd like to now turn over the call to Gina to share more about our detailed results and updated outlook. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, we made further progress building a healthier foundation for Hasbro as we delivered better profits, moderated the pace of our revenue decline and continue to up-level our internal processes and systems. I'm pleased with our team's execution in the first half as we continue to drive operational rigor across the company. Similar to Q1, we once again saw outperformance in digital licensing led by a material step-up in contribution from MONOPOLY GO! as the game's momentum allowed us to exceed the minimum guarantee sooner than expected.\nThis, along with healthy growth in consumer product licensing, growth in MAGIC and another strong quarter from our supply chain team drove significant operating margin expansion. And while we still have more than half a year left from a revenue contribution standpoint, we're doing a lot of the right things and are confident from where we sit today to take up our full year guidance. Our turnaround in toys is well underway. Q2 declined similar to Q1 as we had anticipated. And while Q3 and the back-to-school selling season will be an important gauge, we're entering the second half with clean retail inventory and are seeing encouraging demand signals for our planned innovation.\nAnd by putting the right underlying demand and supply planning processes and systems in place, we've been able to bring aged inventory down to historic lows, while ensuring we have suitable inventory levels to support sell-through for the holidays. We've also improved our end-to-end planning capabilities to better align where we source inventory with customer demand. In the first half of this year, we've already had some major wins from our supply chain team. And with that, I'd like to acknowledge Stephanie Beal, who has been instrumental to this transformation and congratulate her on becoming our new Supply Chain Officer.\nIntegrated business planning plays an important role as we transform Hasbro into a more profitable and operationally agile company. After the first couple of quarters of implementation, we're seeing greater information flow and faster decision-making, which is starting to show up in ours. And just like we're focused on digitization across play patterns, we're also enhancing our digital operations to ensure we're running as efficiently as possible and is why I'm excited to welcome Dan Shull as our new Chief Digital Information Officer.\nDan brings a wealth of Fortune 500 experience and will steer our digital and IT strategy using cutting-edge technology to enhance collaboration, accelerate data analytics, modernize our infrastructure.\nNow moving on to Q2 financial results. Total Hasbro net revenue was $995 million, down 18% versus Q2 of last year. If you exclude the impact of the eOne divestiture, total revenue was down 6%. Growth of 20% in our Wizards of the Coast segment, led by MAGIC and licensed digital games, was more than offset by the 20% decline in consumer products, driven by lower closeout volume, reduced entertainment slate exited brands.\nThe Entertainment segment declined 90% due to the sale of the eOne film and TV business, Absent this impact, entertainment revenue decreased 30% driven by timing. Adjusted operating profit was $249 million, for an adjusted operating margin of 25%, up nearly 14 points year-on-year. This substantial improvement was driven by favorable business mix, lower royalty expense, supply chain productivity savings, the eOne divestiture and about a 2.5 point benefit from lapping the D&D movie impairment. Q2 adjusted net earnings were $170 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.22, up from $0.49 in the year-ago period, driven by the items noted as well as reduced net interest expense and favorable timing within tax.\nWe returned $97 million to shareholders through the dividend and ended the period with $1.1 of cash and short-term investments following May's completion of a $500 million debt offering of notes. The proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used to repay our November 2024 bond maturity. Year-to-date, total Hasbro revenue was $1.75 billion, down 21% versus the same period last year. If you exclude the impact of the eOne divestiture, total revenue was down 7% versus a year ago. Growth of 15% in our Wizards to the Coast segment was more than offset by the 20% decline in consumer products and the 11% decline in the Entertainment segment due to the sale of the eOne film and TV business.\nAbsent film and TV, the entertainment segment is relatively flat. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit was $397 million for an adjusted operating margin of 22.7% up over 14 points year-over-year, mostly driven by cost savings from our operational excellence program as well as favorable business mix and the eOne divestiture. In aggregate, we were able to deliver significant margin improvement despite the ongoing volume deleverage across our toy business. Year-to-date, adjusted net earnings were $255 million, with diluted earnings per share of $1.83, driven by the improvement in operating profit as well as favorability from a stock compensation adjustment and net interest expense reduction.\nOperating cash flow was $365 million year-to-date, a $246 million improvement year-over-year, driven by the profitability improvement, timing of digital licensing collections, as well as the shift in timing of a transition tax payment to Q3. Now let's look at our 2 major segments in more detail, starting with Wizards of the Coast in digital gaming. Q2 revenue grew 20% year-over-year, largely behind strength in digital licensing led by MONOPOLY GO! and to a lesser extent, continued contribution from Baldur's Gate 3. Last quarter, we discussed there could be the ability to book above the minimum guarantees sooner than originally planned.\nDue to the game's momentum, we were able to earn approximately $35 million above the minimum guarantee of $5 million in the quarter. Segment revenue also benefited from growth in MAGIC tabletop behind the successful release of Modern Horizons 3 as well as early shipments for next week's [ tentpole ] both of which more than offset last year's Q2 contribution from Lord of the Rings. Digital gaming revenue also saw a roughly $20 million noncash benefit from a publishing contract with an international partner.\nOperating margin for Wizards finished at 54.7%, up nearly 17 points versus last year, mainly driven by a richer digital mix, supply chain productivity gains, and lower royalty expenses as we lapped last year's MAGIC Lord of the Ring set.\nTurning to Consumer Products. Q2 revenue declined 20% year-over-year, driven by reduced closeout volume exited brands and lapping a busier entertainment slate, including last year's Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. Consumer product licensing was a bright spot driven by our partnership with MY LITTLE PONY and Kayou Trading Cards. [ FURBY ] and the continued momentum in [indiscernible], G.I. Joe and PLAY-DOH also performed well within toys, while [indiscernible] continued to see softness ahead of the back half innovation launch. Adjusted operating margin for Consumer Products came in roughly breakeven, down about 3.5 points compared to last year. Cost savings and the benefit from lower unprofitable closeouts were offset by product mix and volume deleverage.\nAs anticipated, there was also approximately $10 million of operating income attributed to the segment as we reallocated cost savings captured within the corporate segment back to CP. On a year-to-date basis, despite a revenue decline of 20%, segment operating margin declined by only 3 points year-on-year as we were able to significantly mitigate the deleverage impact by reducing our cost across supply chain and within operating expenses.\nNow turning to our updated guidance for 2024. Given the strong performance in the first half, we are raising our guidance for the full year, and we now expect total Wizards revenue to be down 1% to 3%, and up from our prior guidance of down 3% to 5%, driven by the first half outperformance in digital licensing. For the full year, MONOPOLY GO! will generate roughly $105 million in revenue. This outlook assumes a modest monthly gross revenue decay rate for the game and consistent marketing support.\nFor Baldur's Gate 3, we now anticipate roughly $30 million for the full year, with the bulk of that revenue having been recorded in the first half. With all of these puts and takes, digital licensing will be down in Q3 as we lap the launch of Baldur's Gate 3, and we anticipate Q4 to be relatively flat versus last year. For MAGIC, we expect some contraction in the second half due to the timing of set releases. While Modern Horizons 3 successfully lapped the initial release of Lord of the Rings, it will not have a comparison launch for last year's holiday bundle.\nWe now forecast Wizard operating margin to be approximately 42%, up from our prior guidance of 38% to 40%, driven by the increased mix of the licensing revenue. For Consumer Products, keeping in mind that a big part of the year is ahead of us, we expect revenue will be down 7% to 11%, up slightly from our prior guidance range of down 7% to 12%. This narrowing is driven by encouraging early demand signals and retailer support for our back half product innovation specifically Beyblade, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS ahead of the major animated film Transformers One in September. We are forecasting a low single-digit decline in Q3 before flipping to growth in Q4 with the impact from our divested brands continuing to be a headwind.\nWe maintain our adjusted operating margin guidance of 4% to 6% for consumer products. Margins in Q3 will be relatively flat versus last year followed by significant expansion in Q4 as we lap the impact of the inventory cleanup. For entertainment, adjusting for the impact of the eOne divestiture. We continue to expect revenue to be down approximately $15 million versus last year and adjusted operating margin of roughly 60%. We remain on track towards our target of $750 million of gross cost savings by 2025 and continue to expect $200 million to $250 million of net cost savings in 2024.\nThrough the first half of the year, we have delivered $150 million of gross cost savings and $90 million of net savings. With the increased revenue outlook and greater profitability in Wizards, we now expect total Hasbro adjusted EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion, up from our prior year guidance of $925 million to $1 billion. Given the improvement in our cash flow, we now expect 2024 ending cash to be at roughly similar levels versus 2023 and from a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities remain to first invest behind the core business.\nSecond is to return cash to shareholders via the dividend; and third, to continue progressing towards our long-term leverage targets and pay down debt.\nAnd with that, we can open the line for questions."

Welcome to Hasbro's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Hancock, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance, and then we will take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nThese factors include those have worked in our annual report on Form 10-K our most recent 10-Q in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. Today's guidance assumes we retain the non-core entertainment film and TV business, notwithstanding our recently announced agreement with Lionsgate to sell this business. That transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call. I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Debbie, and good morning. A year ago, we outlined a strategy to grow share in key categories with our core toy and game franchises. We called it fewer, bigger, better, drive savings and investment capacity through operational excellence, and build new growth for the company across games, direct-to-consumer and licensing. We also announced our intention to refocus on what has traditionally made us great, the business of play. This required making tough choices, including some significant divestitures. The goal of this plan, Blueprint 2.0 was a more focused, profitable and higher growth has grown built on a portfolio of some of the most valuable brands in the toy and games industry.\nWe've made progress against this framework, including impressive growth in Wizards and Digital, continued momentum in direct-to-consumer and share gains in key categories. But as our Q3 results show, particularly in our Consumer Products segment, more needs to be done. This morning, we will talk about progress on each pillar and add a special emphasis on a key part of our plan, returning consumer products to growth.\nLet's start with refocusing on Play. Play is what makes our brands great and our company healthy. The sale of one film and TV, which continues to be on track for an end of year close, will simplify our operating model and refocus Hasbro on our core mission. Moving forward, our entertainment efforts will be franchise-led and asset-light, focused on driving toy and game sales with support from world-class content partners. We have over 30 projects in development from blockbuster movies like the upcoming Transformers 1 with Paramount to an animated Magic series with Netflix to digital-first IT development like our new YouTube series odd pause. The margin and simplification benefits of refocusing on Play will grow over time as our teams build innovative next-generation toy games reinforced by cost-effective and partner-led content.\nNext, operational excellence, where we are making solid progress, but need to accelerate flow through. Our cost savings initiatives have already exceeded our 2023 savings targets of $150 million. This year, we anticipate total gross savings of approximately $200 million dollars we are using to fund short-term inventory reductions and product promotions in a toy market facing headwinds and to invest long term in new consumer insight capabilities and our growth initiatives. Importantly, our supply chain team is reinventing itself. In a time where inflation is up over 4%, our logistics and production costs are down mid-single digits.\nSupply chain alone is driving approximately $100 million of the full year's expected savings, and we see more opportunities ahead to enhance our gross margins while improving the quality and competitiveness of our toys and games. For instance, we'll be releasing a new version of Jenga, it will be of comparable quality but lower cost and higher margin, all based on a fresh design for cost model. We are replicating this up and down our line. Our revamped supply chain is helping us get smarter on inventory management. Through Q3, Hasbro's total inventory is down 27% year-over-year, with a 34% reduction in our CP business. We anticipate we'll end the year with inventories 20% to 25% below 2022 levels. This should enable us to improve cash flow and lower our allowances in the quarters to come.\nGiven the headwinds facing our Consumer Products segment, the flow-through to the bottom line on these initiatives has not materialized as quickly as anticipated. So we plan to accelerate our efforts heading into 2024. We expect to achieve our 2025 goal of $250 million to $300 million in gross cost savings earlier than expected, and we'll use these incremental savings and healthier inventory position to flow more cash directly to the bottom line, particularly in CP.\nNext, our growth initiatives, which are broadly on track. Wizards of the Coast in digital gaming is up 11% year-to-date. MAGIC: THE GATHERING is delighting tens of millions of fans with new concepts like Universes Beyond, which combine Magic with fan favorite IP like Lord of the Rings and Dr. [ Ho ]. Universe is beyond is a long-term multiproperty strategy that is already delivering collector excitement and new player growth. Last week, we announced a new collaboration with the beloved video game series Fallout and [ stop tree ] orders climbed #1 in the toy game charts over the weekend on Amazon. And on Monday, we expanded our partnership with the Walt Disney Company with the announcement of a multiset Magic and Marvel collaboration. Expect more exciting news and previews in the quarters to come.\nD&D is expanding into a digitally driven multimedia franchise. Baldur's Gate 3, the new video game from Larian Studios, based on D&D [ edition ] is one of the best-selling games of 2023 and one of the highest rated video games of all time with metacritic reviews equivalent to mega franchises like Grand Theft Auto and the Legend of Zelda. Our success in digital is in just contains the world of core gaming. MONOPOLY GO! from our partners at [ Scopely ] is the #1 mobile game launch of 2023. Combined, Hazro expects to generate in excess of $90 million in license revenue from these 2 properties this year with a multiyear long tail anticipated. These were long-term thoughtful partnerships. Each game was signed pre-2018, and we have several more of these kinds of projects in the pipeline including new games from our own internal studios, which we'll be sharing more about in the coming months.\nOur direct-to-consumer business is up 57% year-to-date. Hasbro Pulse is a modest-sized platform today, but is scaling rapidly, giving us a new avenue to delight bands and learn from our consumers. We're excited to continue to grow our direct initiatives behind brands like Star Wars, Marvel, Transformers, MAGIC, GI Joe, [ Power Rangers ], one of the best lineups of IP in the collectible space. And we continue to scale our industry-leading licensing business across an array of brands and categories from [indiscernible] to Transformers, education to location-based entertainment.\nNext, growing share in key categories. In Q3, we grew share in 4 of 5 of our key categories: preschool, action, blasters and arts and crafts. Driving this, we have several brands that are going well. In gaming, Magic and D&D are having record years. MONOPOLY is back to growth, recently reclaiming the title of the top-selling board game brand. New innovation like Twister Air is driving genre expansion and board games. Transformers point of sale is up over 30% year-over-year, and PLAY-DOH is also showing solid gains. GI Joe continues to be a fan favorite and growth driver for our Pulse business, and Furby is off to a strong start, one of the hottest new toy interruptions of the holiday. But we have challenges and other brands that weigh on our results, particularly in our Consumer Products business.\nLet's now turn to how we return this key segment back to growth. We went into 2023, expecting a toy category down low single digits for the year. We expected Hazro performance to be broadly in line with market, minus our exited licenses and business. Year-to-date, our point of sale is roughly in line with category. However, market performance has been more challenging than planned. Our internal POS system shows total point of sale down negative 8% through Q3, roughly equivalent to our view of the total toy market or negative 4% when accounting for exited licenses. We saw the category soften during Q3 to negative 10%, again, roughly equivalent to our view of market or negative 5% when accounting for discontinued licenses. Our share is up in our core categories. Our work on operational efficiency means our performance versus market is the best it's been in several years, but we are facing headwinds.\nIn any market scenario, we think the holiday will be late breaking and heavily deal reliant. So we're taking the necessary steps to position our portfolio for continued share growth, exiting the year with momentum for our brands and ensuring our inventory health is back to historical norms. Our guidance is based on a cautious outlook, but we are prepared to take advantage of any opportunities presented. We are investing in Q4 to drive continued share momentum, including maintaining our advertising and promotions at competitive levels and working with retail partners to excite consumers with compelling deals. We are accelerating our cost initiatives to reduce overhead and see near-term flow-through in operating margins. And we continue to invest in product innovation behind a new leadership team in toy that will expand this into new play patterns, price points and market opportunities in the months ahead.\nOur long-term capital priorities guide our decision-making for these near-term decisions, invest to grow the business pay down our debt, maintain a healthy balance sheet and return cash to shareholders via our category-leading dividend. Consistent with these priorities, we are investing to ensure our toy business exits the year with healthy inventories, continued share momentum and a clear runway for new product introductions in 2024.\nWrapping up our results in Q3 so we are making progress across many of our key initiatives, but that we also have more to do. particularly in returning consumer products to growth. [indiscernible] is the diversity of our brands across both toy and game, our Wizards on Digital business continues to demonstrate impressive growth with smart bed coming to fruition this year and lots to be excited about in the years to come. We are likewise investing in toy to strengthen this business for the long term. A healthy toy business is a healthy Hasbro.\nI'd like to now turn over the call to Gina Goetter, our Chief Financial Officer, to share more about our detailed results and an update on guidance. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. The Hauser team continues to make progress in transforming our company, building a world-class gaming business, streamlining and improving the profitability of our consumer products and strengthening our balance sheet. Our third quarter results demonstrate the growth potential across our diversified gaming portfolio, offset by the tough macro environment across toys and entertainment.\nDespite market headwinds, we are growing share in the categories where we compete and are beginning to see the benefits of our cost savings initiatives played through the P&L. Total Hasbro revenue of $1.5 billion was down 10% versus last year. Wizards of the Coast in digital gaming revenue increased 40% behind strong contribution from Baldur's Gate 3, MONOPOLY GO! and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Consumer products declined 18% due to macro category trends and planned business exits. Excluding these exits, the segment finished down 12%. The entertainment segment declined 42% due to the rider and [ ACTR strike ] impact. Adjusted operating profit of $343 million increased 27% versus last year. The increase was the result of favorable product mix, most notably high-margin digital game revenues as well as lower royalty and operating expenses. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.64 increased 15% versus last year, reflecting the higher operating profit, partially offset by incremental interest expense and an unfavorable tax rate impact. The adjusted results exclude $512 million of cumulative pretax impact associated with the loss on assets held for sale and to a lesser extent, onetime charges for the operational excellence program.\nLooking at our brand performance. Our Franchise Brands grew 8% in the quarter and were flat year-to-date. These brands represent our biggest and most profitable brands and are just over 60% of our revenue. Within Franchise Brands, we delivered significant Q3 revenue growth across gaming, including DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, Hasbro Gaming and MAGIC. Partner Brands declined year-over-year after strong performance from Marvel and Star Wars in 2022. Partnerships like we have with the Walt Disney Company remain a key priority for us and we expect results to improve in the quarters ahead as we expand our partner brand lines and categories like our just announced collaboration with Marvel and MAGIC.\nTurning to operating margin. Third quarter adjusted operating margin of 22.8% was [ 6 ] margin points higher than last year. The profit impact and the volume decline in Consumer Products was offset by favorable mix growth in licensed digital gaming and MAGIC. Supply chain cost savings outpaced inflation and delivered 1.9 points of margin growth. Operating expenses also contributed 1.4 points behind labor and lower royalty expense for exited licenses. Lower advertising spend contributed 1.7 margin points of improvement as we align spend to current demand. That said, we will continue to invest in advertising and marketing to drive sales this holiday season.\nFinally, lower entertainment deliveries resulted in a decline in program amortization expense that contributed 1.5 points margin. Our transformation activities are delivering real savings in our P&L. Having begun these programs last year, we have a strong start on resetting the cost base for the company, and the savings are helping us navigate a softer toy market. Year-to-date, we have accumulated $62 million of gross cost savings within supply chain and an additional $92 million of gross savings within operating expense. The combined $154 million of gross cost savings this year are more than offsetting supply chain cost inflation and allowing us to reinvest in the business and partially defray the higher cost to move through inventory. Cumulatively, since we began the savings program last year, we have reduced our cost base and delivered gross savings of $174 million. This progress puts us on track to meet our long-term gross savings goals earlier than expected, and we will be doubling down as we continue to focus on streamlining our operations and improving the profitability within toys.\nWe continue to make progress in lowering inventory levels. We've reduced total owned inventory 27% versus prior year, primarily driven by a 34% reduction in the Consumer Products segment inventory. From a retail inventory perspective, their inventory was down 18% year-over-year, but up sequentially versus last quarter as they set through the holiday season. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on ensuring we have a clean start to 2024, both in owned and retail inventory levels and we'll continue remaining agile in taking actions to stay in sync with broader category momentum.\nLooking more closely at segment performance within the quarter. [ Wider ] segment revenue increased 40% versus last year. [ 23 points ] the growth was led by licensed digital gaming revenue from BG3 and to a lesser extent, MONOPOLY GO! The revenue for Baldur's Gate is realized along with unit sales whereas in the near term, MONOPOLY GO! has a straight-line revenue recognition based on the total multiyear contract minimum guarantee. Cable top revenue, which includes both MAGIC and D&D added 14 points of growth, driven by timing releases, including an incremental magic release in this quarter versus last year. The growth in high-margin license digital gaming drove a 99% increase in total segment operating profit versus last year and expanded operating profit margin by 14.3 percentage points.\nTurning to the Consumer Products segment. The overall toy category was down 8% in the quarter, according to [ Sakana ] versus 6% through the first part of the year. Despite the category headwinds, we gained share in 4 of our 5 key categories, including action figures, arts and crafts, preschool and blasters. Overall, Consumer Products segment rev was down 18% versus last year. Looking at the key drivers for the quarter, 6 points of the revenue decline was driven by planned license exits. Another 12 points of decline was driven by toy and game volume given the broad category trends. 2 points of decline came from pricing and mix, driven by additional closeout costs as we've worked through higher inventory levels. FX had a favorable 2-point impact in the segment. The segment adjusted operating margin declined 1.4 margin points primarily driven by unfavorable mix and higher inventory obsolescence and closeout costs.\nTurning to the Entertainment segment. In the quarter, revenue declined [ 42% ], primarily as a result of the writers and [ actor ] strikes. Partially offsetting this was 53% revenue growth in Family Brands, driven by content sales primarily for PeppaPig and Power Rangers. Adjusted operating profit increased 37% and margin expanded 3.8 margin points to 6.6% due to the exited businesses, lower program amortization and operating expenses. The E1 film and TV assets to be sold has delivered approximately $400 million of revenue year-to-date, which is down approximately 20% versus last year. Full year earnings are expected to be breakeven to a modest loss. We've received the expected regulatory approvals for the sale of E1 film and TV and remain on track to close the deal by the end of the year.\nWrapping up with Hasbro Inc., we delivered $335 million of operating cash year-to-date, which is $73 million ahead of last year, driven by working capital improvements led by the reduction in inventory combined with lower production costs within the Entertainment segment. Our cash and cash equivalents of $186 million does not include approximately $70 million of cash recorded in assets held for sale, the substantial majority of which we expect to stay with Hasbro upon the close of the transaction. Including this, it brings our cash on hand to approximately $250 million up from $217 million in Q2 2023. Through Q3, we repaid $107 million of long-term debt and spent $160 million on capital expenditures led by investments in Wizards of the Coast for future digital gaming releases. And we've returned $291 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends.\nIn the quarter, we booked a 23.2% adjusted underlying tax rate, which compares to 19.9% last year. The higher rate continues to be the result of our film and TV losses and a shift in the geographical mix of income.\nTurning to our 2023 guidance. The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook. Based on this, we now expect total Hasbro Inc. revenue to be down 13% to 15%. As we look at the 3 primary segments, this guidance now assumes that the consumer products business will be down mid- to high teens. Based on the category trend in Q3, we are planning for modest improvement in Q4 as we begin to lap the market declines from last year. We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns. We continue to expect that Wizards of the Coast will deliver high single-digit revenue growth behind the strong performance within digital games and solid performance on MAGIC. The majority of the revenue from BG3 was realized in Q3. We expect a modest positive contribution to revenue from the game in Q4 as it will continue to be recorded in line with unit sales.\nMONOPOLY GO! Q4 revenue will be consistent with Q3 given the accounting methodology. As Chris said, in total, we expect the aggregate contribution from these 2 licensed games to be more than $90 million for the full year. And finally, for entertainment, we continue to expect revenue declines of 25% to 30%, which incorporates the impact of the writers and actors strikes section deliveries in the back half of the year. Minus these assets held for sale, we expect total company revenue declines of 8% to 11% for the year. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be between 13% and 13.5%. This guidance reflects the impact of the CP revenue call down and includes additional onetime cost to clear aged inventory on Hasbro's balance sheet, continued share momentum and reset the foundation heading into next year. This margin guidance includes a step-up in the in-year gross cost savings from our transformation efforts to $200 million. And as we look to 2024, we expect to continue accelerating our savings up to improve the profitability across toys and games.\nGiven the revenue call down, we now expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $900 million to $950 million. And based on this current forecast, we expect to generate $500 million to $600 million of operating cash flow. From a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities are to invest behind the business, pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders via dividends. We remain committed to our dividend strategy and advancing our progress towards achieving an overall 2 to 2.5x long-term leverage target. As I said earlier, we are making good progress on our transformation and the work we've done to date has us positioned to build on our gaming leadership and strengthen our toy business. We believe the toy market will stabilize and return to growth. Our near-term focus is on executing the holiday season, resetting the cost base, moving complexity and sharpening the innovation pipeline for 2024 and 2025.\nChris and I will now take your questions."

I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, [ Karin, ] and good morning, everyone. For more than a year now, you've heard me outline Hasbro's strategy to refocus on play behind the philosophy of fewer, bigger, better. Fewer SKUs that drive higher impact, bigger investment behind winning brands and more focused categories and better innovation, driven by a renewed leadership team and a focus on kids, parents and fans, our consumers, the lifeblood of Hasbro.\nWe laid out a blueprint for a more focused and profitable company with a number of growth initiatives built on a diverse portfolio of some of the most iconic brands in the toy and game industry. While business transformations take time, I'm pleased with how much we accomplished in 2023. Setting the table for a 2024 punctuated by strong profit growth and momentum in renewing Hasbro's innovation engine. We're entering 2024 with a healthier balance sheet. A leaner cost structure and an operational rigor that will maintain and build on these improvements in the quarters ahead. In 2023, we took substantial action to bolster our balance sheet. At the end of the year, we closed our deal with Lionsgate on E1 film and TV, allowing us to focus our investments on higher return, play-focused initiatives, across toys, games and digital.\nProceeds from the deal allowed us to reduce our debt by approximately $400 million. As we shift our entertainment strategy to an asset-light and partner-led model, we took a $1 billion impairment. A noncash item in Q4, which reflects the sale of E1 and a change in outlook for the balance of our owned and operated production efforts. This shift frees up more capital for us to reinvest in toys, games and particularly our digital future. Between hard work from our sales and operations teams and some of the financial actions we took at the end of the quarter, we entered 2024 with inventories down over 50% year-over-year which is well below 2019 levels.\nWe also took steps to improve our structural profitability, exiting a number of low or negative profit businesses that we have shifted to a licensed out model. Finally, we are driving better-than-expected cost savings through our operational excellence work, unlocking crucial investment capacity as we seek to connect with fans of all ages and across all play patterns. Previously, we communicated $350 million to $400 million in annual run rate savings. We're updating our target to $750 million of gross savings by the end of 2025 with half of it dropping to the bottom line. This allows us to reinvest in our business, meaningfully improve our cash flows and return cash to our shareholders, which we are committed to continuing through our category-leading dividend.\nSince I became CEO of 2022, Hasbro has returned almost $1 billion to shareholders and paid down over $0.5 billion in debt. While 2023 was challenging, and we still expect the toy industry to face near-term headwinds, we believe we're taking the necessary steps to turn around our consumer products business. Wizards and digital gaming is coming off a banner year, led by Magic's Universe & Beyond the success of Baldur's Gate III from our partners of [ Larian ] and Monopoly Go from [ Scopely ]\n2024 is about returning consumer products to profitability, investing for long-term momentum in games and driving significant improvements in Hasbro's bottom line fueled by operational discipline and renewed product innovation. In short, we're putting all the right pieces together to keep investing in our growth initiatives while expanding the ways our franchises reach bands through digital games. We expect the next year we'll likely see continued headwinds in the toy category. We're exiting 2023 with our retail inventory down around 20%. While we think Hasbro's retail inventories in a healthy position across the industry, a lot of older discounted inventory still remains in the market.\nThe consumer remains value conscious and we anticipate entertainment will be less of a tailwind in the year ahead behind a reduced box office slate. Anticipating these headwinds, we made necessary choices to get our cost structure and inventory positions healthy. Accelerating a number of cost savings initiatives by several quarters. Since I became CEO, we have significantly enhanced our consumer insights capabilities and upgraded our design and toy leadership.\nIn 2024, we'll see more and more of the resulting innovation improvements as these capability upgrades come to market across our portfolio. As such, we believe we're in a good position to at least pace the industry this year with innovation and share trends accelerating to ahead of market as we head into 2025. Turning around the product pipeline is key with the right people and the right insights. At the end of the day, it's all about great product. In the back half of 2023, we started to see the first evidence of our new team and products working. Take FURBY, for example. This was a product we took our time testing and iterating based on consumer insights. It paid off as FURBY as one of the top new toy introductions in 2023. We continued to FURBY craze in December with the launch of Furblet, another hit introduction, and we're excited to continue building this franchise in 2024. 2023 was also a strong year for our Transformers franchise on the back of the hit movie Transformers Rise of the Beast from our partners in Paramount, driving point-of-sale growth of 35%.\nWe have some exciting activations planned as we celebrate the brand's 40th anniversary in 2024 as well as the star-studded animated movie Transformers 1 coming this summer along with fresh merchandise. This year also marks Peppa Pig's 20th birthday. We'll be celebrating with new innovative products and an entertainment special featuring A-list talent, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. After gaining share in the arts and crafts category in 2023, with another strong year, including our ultimate ice cream truck, the PLATO team continues to innovate.\nWe expect more creative surprises and new cross-brand collaborations in the year ahead. In action figures, we are leaning into our category-leading collaboration with The Walt Disney Company for their Marvel Super Heroes assemble marketing campaign, featuring new price points and products across our lines including all new preschool fund with Spidey and his amazing friends. For Star Wars, we're excited to expand our best-selling Lightsaber forge [ Kybrcore ] series and introduce our new 799 Epic series 4-inch action figures.\nWe saw an incredibly strong launch from [indiscernible] last year in Japan from our partners at Takaratomi and are eagerly anticipating the U.S. launch this summer. What we believe will be one of the hottest new toys in 2024. It's an exciting product that we think long-time collectors and kids fresh to the franchise will be thrilled with. The blaster category continues to be under pressure, but we also continue to believe this is a strong and enduring play pattern for fans of all ages. This year, we'll be introducing new innovation into the category, featuring a new performance start technology, pop off-the-shelf design and attractive pricing up and down the range.\nBoard Games continues to be a leading category for us and one we anticipate will grow in the year ahead. Twister Air was the #1 new game across the G10 markets in 2023, according to Carcano, thanks to an innovative new augmented reality experience. You're going to see a renewed focus on expanding genres, leveraging our reach and distribution strength to introduce more cool new games than ever and working with some of the brightest designers in the industry to give their games a platform they deserve. Whether it's old party games, family card games, casual strategy or extending mega hits like MONOPOLY, 2024 will be a big year for gaming from Hasbro.\nSpeaking of games, Wizards & Digital outperformed our guidance in 2023, driven by a series of blockbuster hits. Magic had another record year in '23 with a string of amazing new sets including our best-selling set of all time, the Lord of the Rings, Tales of [indiscernible] While a product like Lord to the Rings creates a tough comp in 2024, we have some unique sets that fans are eagerly anticipating. Including March's fallout, a new Commander focused Universe & Beyond product line. This summer is Modern Horizon 3, the equal to our prior best-selling set of all time, and this September's Charming New World, [ Bloomborogh. ]\nWe continue to see the power of our franchises play out with our digital licensing partners. MONOPOLY Go from our partners in [ Scopely ] is the #1 mobile game launch of all time in the U.S. outperforming the launches of global phenomena like Pokemon Go and Candy Crush and the fastest mobile title to reach $1 million in the U.S. and the game continues to break records. In Q4 alone, the game drove more than $800 million in revenue worldwide for Scopely. As far as our financial participation goes for revenue and profit, it's like having the equivalent of $1 billion movie supporting MONOPOLY, except every year with the impact growing sequentially as the game works through our minimum guarantees and marketing allowances.\nBaldur's Gate III from our partners at [ Larian ] continues to win awards around the world and is 1 of the highest-rated video games of all time. We expect a long tail into 2024 and beyond for this mega hit. Last but not least, we have a compelling new lineup of adventures, core rule books and new digital-first offerings for D&D as we celebrate this iconic brand's 50th anniversary. We'll launch the biggest update to fifth edition since its introduction in 2014, reinventing everything from the artwork of our iconic monsters, to new classes to new mechanics to bold new ways to bring to life the world of D&D digitally.\nAll of this will add up to more and more impressive products as the year goes on, leading into an even brighter 2025. We look forward to sharing more about 2025, all new brands, entertainment collaborations and a chance to really show what this team is capable of later this year. Wrapping up, 2023 was a challenging year, but not without significant wins. Wins we believe [indiscernible] Hasbro to come. a company rededicated to play, innovation and fun for fans of all ages.\nLast year, we launched a top toy with FURBY. We won a Game of the Year award with Twister Air, and we wowed tens of millions with MONOPOLY Go, Transformers Rise of the Beast, Baldur's Gate III and Magic Lord of the Rings. All while cleaning up the business, selling E1, paying down debt and clearing excess inventory, which makes for a healthier, stronger Hasbro to start 2024. I'm excited to see the results to come. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina to share more about our detailed results and to provide guidance for the year. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2023 marked an important milestone in our transformation towards a more streamlined and profitable toy and game companies. As Chris mentioned, transformations take time. And amidst the tough industry backdrop, I'm proud of the progress that Hasbro team made over the past several quarters in resetting the business and getting us in the best position for 2024. Before I touch on the financial highlights for the past year, I want to recap 3 major actions we took and how to think through their impacts. First, we successfully closed the sale of the E1 Film and TV business to Lionsgate and we used the proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million, which will result in annual interest expense savings of approximately $25 million.\nIn addition to reducing our leverage, the sale of E1 frees up capital to invest in higher growth initiatives while allowing us to continue monetizing Hasbro IP in an asset-light structure. In conjunction with the sale and the change in the business strategy for family brands, namely Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, we recorded a noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of approximately $1 billion, which you will see in our reported results. As we look to 2024, besides the reduction in interest expense, we also expect to see an improvement in operating margin as well as an improvement to cash flow given the reduction in production spending.\nSecond, in Q4, we accelerated efforts to clean up our excess inventory. As I had mentioned last quarter, we were focused on starting 2024 in a cleaner position and would remain agile in taking actions consistent with broader category momentum. While we landed within our revenue guidance, we do not see the holiday season pickup that we were hoping for, and as a result, with more aggressive actions in bringing inventory levels down over 50% from the prior year.\nOur inventory is now running well below pre-pandemic levels, and we believe this improved position will allow us to drive higher value retail distribution and return focus to upcoming toy and game innovation. We also expect annual savings of roughly $10 million from exiting overflow locations previously used to store excess inventory. And while this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business, the near-term impact from accelerating this cleanup resulted in a roughly $130 million noncash impact to operating income.\nLastly, as part of our operational excellence program, we made the difficult decision in Q4 to reduce the size of our workforce. While these decisions are never easy, this move will enable cost savings, which will improve profitability and fuel investments towards long-term growth around toy and digital games innovation. Moving to our financial results and business segment highlights. In Q4, we saw a continuation of the trends seen throughout much of the year. Total Hasbro revenue of $1.3 billion was down 23% versus last year. Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming revenue increased 7% behind ongoing contributions from the award-winning Baldur's Gate III and MONOPOLY GO. Consumer products declined 25% due to the planned business exits, broader category declines and an enhanced focus on clearing inventory.\nQ4 adjusted operating loss of $50 million was down year-on-year, mostly driven by nonrecurring and noncash charges of $168 million, which includes the $130 million of inventory write-offs. We believe the cleanup efforts are behind us as we are starting 2024 at much healthier levels compared to prior years, and our retail inventory is at an acceptable level. Q4 adjusted net earnings were $52 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.38, also down versus the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned nonrecurring charges.\nFor the full year 2023, Total Hasbro revenue of $5 billion was down 15% versus 2022 and within our previously stated guidance range. Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming revenues grew 10% and ahead of our guidance, benefiting from the success of Baldur's Gate III, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY GO. Consumer Products revenues were down 19% for the full year, driven by planned business exits, softer industry trends and stronger inventory management on behalf of our retailers. Adjusting for the exited brands and markets, revenue would have declined by 15% and despite the tougher category backdrop, we delivered some bright spots within our toy portfolio, including Transformers, Twister Air, FURBY and GI Joe.\nOn a reported basis, the Entertainment segment revenue declined by 31% as the rider and ACTR strikes impacted content deliveries. Family Brands revenue grew 6% from streaming deals of animated content in support of Hasbro's brands. Total Hasbro Inc. 2023 adjusted operating profit was $477 million, down 48% versus last year, primarily driven by the nonrecurring expenses as well as lower revenues. 2023 adjusted net earnings of $349 million or $2.51 per diluted share was down 44% versus last year.\nBesides the charges for inventory, Earnings were negatively impacted by content impairments and higher royalty expense, partially offset by our cost savings program and a onetime tax benefit. Operating cash flow for the full year was $726 million, well ahead of our guidance and nearly doubled from the prior year driven mostly by a working capital benefit of approximately $350 million due to the inventory cleanup efforts. We ended the year with $545 million in cash on our balance sheet and reduced debt by approximately $500 million. We also returned $388 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends.\nBefore I move to guidance for 2024. I want to frame how we're thinking about the year ahead from an operational perspective and in particular, how we're looking to turn around the Consumer Products business. In 2023, we took the necessary steps in our transformation to reset the business. This year, with the right foundation in place, we are focused on reinvigorating innovation across the portfolio while continuing to drive operational rigor which we expect to pave the way for sustainable profitable growth.\nThe near-term model that we're building is one where cost productivity provides the fuel to innovate and grow the business. And in 2024, there remains a significant opportunity to improve the underlying profitability while rebuilding its innovation engine. These 2 go hand-in-hand and align with our overarching strategy of focusing on fewer bigger and better brands. Over the past several quarters, we have been mobilizing around this imperative and taking actions to simplify and prioritize resources on our largest portfolios and biggest bets. One of the single biggest contributors to complexity reduction relates to our product portfolio. Moving into 2024, we have eliminated about half of our SKUs.\nThese SKUs were only 2% of our revenue and were duplicative and unprofitable, clouding the network and creating cost for us and our retailers. Along similar lines, we made the decision to move to an out-license model for brands where we determine their respective path to scale and profitability as an owned and operated entity did not meet our internal thresholds. In 2024 for Real Friends and Easy Bake Oven will transition. While there are short-term impacts to revenue from this model shift, we ultimately can expect greater operating profit dollars from out-licensed IP and it allows us to focus resources back to our core brands.\nIn 2023, we started the work to streamline our supply chain and improve the efficiency of the organization. And in 2024, we will be continuing these efforts by reaching further upstream to unlock value in our product design and manufacturing processes. We are taking an organization-wide focus across the supply chain brand teams, product development, procurement and manufacturing to identify waste and redefine the right design to value equation for each product. Ultimately, this will culminate in higher margins and contribute to an improved play experience. We started this work last year on select brands within our Hasbro Gaming portfolio, and we'll be rapidly extending this approach to 2 of our biggest brands. NERF and PLAY-DOH.\nAlso within our supply chain, we are building new capabilities within planning and forecasting to ensure that inventory levels both owned and retail remain within the desired thresholds. We made significant progress coming out of 2023, and these updated processes and tools will ensure that we maintain a healthy inventory position. Since coming on board at Hasbro, I've talked about the imperative to bring costs down within managed expenses to staff the dynamic of overhead growing faster than revenue, particularly within the Consumer Products segment.\nIn December, we announced the next round of actions to address the organizational structure. We have also introduced zero-based budgeting as a tool to help us optimize our spending and ensure dollars invested are driving the right actions in our in support of our strategy. And finally, we are continuing to enhance our capabilities around consumer insights, revenue growth management and marketing effectiveness as core drivers in strengthening our foundation and enhancing product development.\nLooking forward to the 2024 holidays, we have more innovation compared to last year that's backed by insights and stronger pricing precision. This, coupled with stronger planned execution with our retailers, will enable Q4 growth across the toy business. Turning to guidance for 2024 and looking more closely at the 2 main operating segments. Total Wizards revenue is forecasted down 3% to 5%. The decline is primarily a result of the strong growth delivered in 2023 behind the launch of Baldur's Gate III and the Magic Lord of the Rings set. Looking at each of the pieces, we are planning for growth within D&D with the upcoming update of the Fifth Edition and the continued expansion of D&D Beyond.\nMAGIC will have the same number of releases in 2024 as last year. but revenue will be flat to down as we comp Lord of the Rings. It's important to call out that Magic will be back to growth in 2025 as we expand our universe is beyond lineup. Licensed digital games will be relatively flat. The revenue from Baldur's Gate III will begin to taper down as we move through the year and will be partially offset by the continued momentum of Monopoly GO. With the success of the game, we are now anticipating that we will begin to record revenue higher than the contract minimum guarantee in the back half of the year.\nFrom a phasing standpoint, we expect lizards revenue to grow in the front half with the decline coming in the back half as we comp the huge launches. Wizard's operating margin will be between 38% and 40%, which will be up 200 to 400 basis points versus last year. The margin improvement is a result of a favorable mix shift within digital, lower royalty rates across MAGIC and strong cost management within operating expenses. Margins are also benefiting from supply chain cost productivity more than offsetting the inflation.\nFor Consumer Products, revenue will be down 7% to 12%. About half of the decline is due to actions we've taken to improve profitability, including the planned business exits as well as a reduction in unprofitable closeout revenue given the significant inventory cleanup executed at year-end. The other half of the decline is a result of prevailing category trends. Overall, we are planning to grow share in the categories in which we compete and are leaning into innovation green shoots with step-ups in Hasbro Gaming, Bala, PLAY-DOH Serbia and NERF. And we are also adopting a more agile approach with our marketing dollars to better target consumers and increase the effectiveness of the spend.\nWe are forecasting revenue trends will improve as we move through the year with steeper declines in Q1 and Q2 and stabilization coming in the back half of the year behind innovation, marketing effectiveness and maintaining healthy retail inventory levels heading into the holidays. A key focus for 2024 is improving the profitability of toys, and we are forecasting operating margins to be between 4% and 6%, which is 500 to 700 basis points better than last year.\nApproximately 400 basis points of improvement is driven by the lap of the nonrecurring inventory charges, and this is almost completely offset by the anticipated volume declines and associated deleverage impact. The additional margin expansion is driven by a combination of favorable product mix due to less closeout volume, supply chain cost savings more than offsetting inflation, reduce complexity across the network and operating expense reductions.\nMargin will also be positively impacted from the work on SKU elimination and design to value, which I mentioned earlier. For entertainment, stripping out the impact of the E1 divestiture, revenue will be down approximately $15 million versus last year and operating margin will show significant improvement driven by operating expense reductions as well as lapping the impact of the D&D movie impairment in 2023. We will continue to report entertainment as a separate segment for 2024, albeit on a much smaller base. As part of the 2024 guidance, we are increasing our gross cost savings target through 2025 and from the $350 million to $400 million communicated in December to $750 million.\nThrough 2023, we have delivered approximately $220 million of gross cost savings and anticipate a sizable step up as we move through the next 2 years. Roughly half of the gross cost savings will drop to the bottom line as we focus on improving profitability and the remaining dollars will be reinvested back into the business to support growth initiatives, including the reinvigoration of toy innovation and the continued investment in the gaming business. With the improvement in operating margin across all segments, total Hasbro Inc. EBITDA is forecasted to be $925 million to $1 billion, up $215 million to $290 million versus the prior year.\nThe positive impact from the cost structure reset as well as the lack of the onetime inventory cleanup in 2023 is more than able to offset the revenue decline and cost inflation. We are planning for relatively flat owned inventory levels in 2024 and estimate approximately $225 million of project capital to support growth initiatives and invest back into the infrastructure as we continue to rebuild the underpinning of the operation. Ending cash will be slightly down versus 2023, driven by relatively flat owned inventory levels, increased capital project spending and additional costs associated with the restructuring actions announced in December. From a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities remain to first invest behind the core business.\nSecond is to return cash to shareholders via the dividend; and third, to continue progressing towards our long-term leverage targets and pay down debt. As you heard Chris mention, we remain committed to our category-leading dividend and believe that the changes that we've made within working capital to free up cash as well as the changes we're making on the broader cost structure provide enough cash flexibility to deliver on the capital allocation priorities.\nThe Board has declared our next quarterly dividend payable in May, and keeping consistent with industry best practices as we move through 2024, we will be shifting the declaration of the dividend to more closely align with the record date. And to close, looking out beyond 2024, we expect that the Consumer Products business will return to low single-digit revenue growth and that Wizards will return to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. With our step-up in cost savings, we remain committed to getting to 20% operating margin with the potential to reach that milestone before 2027. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris to wrap up.\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Gina. Turnarounds take time, and for our toy business, we are still in the early innings. While we're likely to face some near-term industry headwinds in 2024 and we're comping a better-than-planned 2023 for Wizards. The work we have done under the hood to strengthen our balance sheet, upgrade our planning and rightsize our inventory are a strong foundation to build from. I want to thank the teams at Hasbro for driving this and putting our fans first.\nThis year is all about execution as we build on that foundation, drive our profitability and reinvigorate our innovation pipeline for category share gains in 2024 and renewed top line growth in 2025 and beyond. We'll now pause to take your questions."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Kristen Levy, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nAnd good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance, then we will take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website.\nThe press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nThese factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K our most recent 10-Q in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We -- today's guidance assumes we retain the non-core entertainment film and TV business, notwithstanding the agreement we just entered into with Lionsgate to sell this business.\nThat transaction is subject to customary closing condition and regulatory approvals. Following closing of that transaction, we plan to update our guidance. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call. I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kristen, and good morning. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Hasbro has entered into a definitive agreement to sell our eOne phone and T%V business to Lionsgate for approximately $500 million, consisting of cash of $375 million and the assumption of production financing loans.\nThis purchase will include a team of talented employees, a content library of nearly 6,500 titles, active productions for non Hasbro owned IP like the Rookie, Yellow Jackets and Naked and Afraid franchises, eOne's Canadian film and TV operations and the eOne unscripted business, which will include rights for producing Hasbro based shows like PLAY-DOH Squished.\nWe expect the transaction to complete by the end of 2023. Hasbro will use proceeds to retire a minimum of $400 million of floating rate debt by the end of the year, and for other general corporate purposes. Hasbro Entertainment will be the new marquee for our ongoing entertainment efforts after the sale closes\nUnder the leadership of [ Olivier Dumont ], the current head of eOne family brands, Hasbro Entertainment's mission is to develop, finance and produce entertainment based on the rich bulk of Hasbro owned brands. We'll bring to life new original ideas designed to fuel all areas of Hasbro's Blueprint, including toys, publishing, gaming, licensed consumer products and location-based entertainment.\nWe'll retain its focused team of creative development and business affairs experts to shepherd the 30-plus Hasbro based projects in development, working with the best studios and distribution platforms in Hollywood, including ongoing development of the TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE franchises, PLAY-DOH, D&D, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and our board game portfolio.\nAs part of the sale, we expect to move to an asset-light model for future live action entertainment, relying on licensing and partnerships with select co-productions like our previously announced TRANSFORMERS animated film and the D&D live-action television series, both with our partners at Paramount.\nThe sale of eOne is another important milestone in our transformation at Hasbro. Last year, we articulated a plan to turn around Hasbro, driving growth in fewer, bigger, more profitable brands, improving our consumer focus, execution and innovation and building our operational excellence to fuel our bottom line and create sustainable performance.\nAt the highest level, it's a plan about recentering Hasbro on what has helped us create one of the most valuable portfolios of brands in toys and games, the timeless power of play. I'm pleased to report in Q2, we've made substantial progress against these goals. Hasbro delivered better-than-planned operating results for the second quarter, including revenue of $1.2 billion and adjusted operating profit of $137 million, which includes a $25 million charge we took for the D&D: HONOR AMONG THIEVES feature film. The movie is among the best reviewed films of 2023. We and has performed well in streaming, but the box office didn't meet expectations. POS in the quarter was at or ahead of market. And when factoring exited businesses was ahead of market.\nThrough the first half, PEPPA PIG, TRANSFORMERS, PLAY-DOH, D&D, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Hasbro Games have all grown point of sale. According to [ Sircana ], the [ G9 ] global toy and game market declined 7% through year-to-date June. We gained share among the G9 in 3 of our 5 focus categories. Action figures behind growth in TRANSFORMERS, arts and craft with PLAY-DOH, and in games behind MONOPOLY.\nOur direct fan-focused business, Hasbro Pulse, increased point-of-sale by 54% in the quarter. TRANSFORMERS: RISE OF THE BEASTS is one of the top box office performers of the year. and has driven an 83% improvement in TRANSFORMERS: POS since its release. MAGIC: THE GATHERING launched what we believe will be the biggest release in our history with LORD OF THE RINGS: TAILS OF MIDDLE EARTH. D&D generated nearly 2 million new registered users on D&D: BEYOND through the first half of the year.\nOur licensing business continues to grow, including the release of one of the biggest mobile games in the last 5 years, MONOPOLY GO from our partners at [ Scopely ], which since its debut has been #1 in downloads in 87 countries on the Apple App Store and 49 countries on Google Play.\nOur operational excellence efforts have driven over $84 million of cost savings year-to-date, money we are using to both fund inventory reduction and clearance efforts and key growth initiatives like direct data analytics and digital. And speaking of inventory, our sales teams have been busy reducing our owned and operated inventory in our Toys and Games segment by 24% year-over-year and our retail inventory by 16%.\nWhile headwinds and uncertainty continue to exist in the toy game category as a whole, a better-than-planned start to the year so far for Hasbro sets us up for success in the back half. Gina will share more in her remarks, but at a high level, we're maintaining our guidance for our Consumer Products segment and raising guidance for our Wizards of the Coast and digital games segment. Due to the writers and actors strikes and underperformance of D&D honor among these, we are lowering our guidance for entertainment.\nMAGIC is on track for a record Q3 with favorable set release timing Boeing results. D&D should have a strong second half powered by excitement for the upcoming PC and console releases of Baldur's Gate 3 from our partners at Larian. [indiscernible] is already a hot seller with initial allocation selling out in under 72 hours.\nMost of our toy and game innovations have only just begun to hit shelves including the new preschool line for Lucas Film's STAR WARS: YOUNG JEDI ADVENTURES, our new AR game, TWISTER AIR, new blaster innovation with NERF: DOUBLE PUNCH and hot new game crossovers like BARBIE MONOPOLY.\nAnd with much improved inventory levels and the bulk of our inventory management efforts phasing down in Q3, we see an opportunity for meaningful margin improvement as the year progresses, particularly as we go into the fourth quarter. Net, we exited our first half with a solid quarter and positive operating indicators for our second half in our core segments.\nOur inventories are greatly improved. We are growing share in key brands, and we are making the improvements necessary to our supply chain and cost structure to see sustained operating margin growth over the mid and long term. We also are making the necessary choices to rightsize our entertainment footprint. Strong brands with quality innovation and execution will be more important than ever in a more unpredictable environment.\nThat's one of the reasons I'm excited by the potential of our new leadership team, who are already bringing a more disciplined approach to our operations and a palpable step-up in product innovation. We continue to move up and to the right on our change curve, evolving our cost savings initiatives to a continuous and relentless improvement model.\nOur supply chain is becoming a competitive advantage with costs back down to near pre-pandemic levels and positioned favorably versus competition. We are seeing momentum with key retailers. Our digital portfolio is tighter and making rapid strides and we are reinventing our approach to data analytics, product development and long-term innovation, paired with our approach of focused entertainment through partners that both inspires and connects to a tight business plan and economic engine, we are positioned well for the medium to long term. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina Goetter, our Chief Financial Officer. Gina?\n\nGina Goetter\n\nCFO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris laid out, we delivered a solid quarter with revenue coming in ahead of expectations and proof points emerging across several of our transformation initiatives. We also announced the sale of the eOne film and TV business, a step that simplifies our strategy and our focus on toys and games. As we look to the quarter, total Hasbro revenue of $1.2 billion was down 10% versus last year. as we continue to see normalization of inventory, lap the exit of certain licensees and markets within the Consumer Product segment, and we had fewer planned releases for Wizards of the Coast.\nThe Entertainment segment revenue was down 3%, primarily due to the exit of non-core businesses in 2022. Excluding these divestitures, the film and TV and Family Brands businesses were up 5% versus prior year. Adjusted operating profit of $137 million was down 43% versus last year.\nIn addition to the revenue decline, we incurred higher inventory closeout costs as we continue to rightsize inventory back to healthier levels. Profit was also negatively impacted by an impairment taken on Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves as a result of box office results coming in below expectations.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.49 was 57% below last year due to the factors noted and includes unfavorable impacts related to taxes and interest expense. The adjusted results exclude the impact of a $296 million film and TV impairment. Through the second quarter, the ongoing writer and actor strikes had minimal impact on our results.\nHowever, as the strikes continue, our 2023 outlook for entertainment has come down. The adjusted results also exclude incremental costs attributed to the Operational Excellence program, and amortization associated with the eOne acquisition. Looking at year-to-date results.\nRevenue of $2.2 billion was down at 12% below last year, driven by declines in the Consumer Products segment and planned timing shifts across entertainment. Wizard segment revenue is down slightly versus prior year. as a result of launch timing and having one fewer release in the front half of this year compared to 2022.\nAdjusted operating profit of $184 million was down 52% versus last year, as we continue to incur higher costs associated with clearing inventory as well as absorb the impact from the D&D film impairment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is $0.49, driven by the factors noted above. Looking at our brand performance.\nOur Franchise Brands were down 5% in the quarter and year to date. These brands represent our biggest and most profitable brands and are just over 50% of our revenue. Within Franchise Brands, we delivered significant Q2 revenue growth in TRANSFORMERS and Dungeons & Dragons, driven by the uplift for the movie releases.\nAdditionally, PEPPA PIG grew as a result of growth in entertainment and digital gaming. Our Partner Brand revenue is down 21% for the quarter. More than 60% of the loss as a result of the licenses we exited at the end of last year. Sales of Hasbro products for Spider-Man by Marvel are up with an over 100% increase in POS since the release of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and further supported by the preschool series and new product releases.\nPartner Brands continue to play a vital role in our portfolio for kids, fans and retailers around the world. Across our portfolio brands, the declines are driven by the reprioritization of investment to support the franchise brands. as well as discontinuances across the retail footprint. However, one of our relaunched portfolio brands, [indiscernible], is off to a promising start. Looking at operating margin.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating margin of 11.3% was 670 basis points below last year. The single biggest impact in the quarter is the volume decline in mix of business. Through the first half of the year, we prioritize cleaning up the portfolio and reducing inventory levels across the CP business. resulting in higher-than-normal closeout costs.\nAlso, as planned, we had one less MAGIC release within the Wizards segment, which created an unfavorable mix and fixed cost absorption impact. Additionally, as we shifted to leverage licensed IP within Wizards, we incurred higher royalty expense, resulting in a 1.7% margin point loss. Momentum is accelerating in our cost savings program.\nAnd year-to-date, we have accumulated $32 million of gross cost savings within supply chain, and an additional $52 million of gross cost savings within operating expense. The combined $84 million of gross savings are more than offsetting cost inflation and have allowed us to reinvest back into the business to support higher levels of marketing spend, fund our inventory reduction efforts and fuel key strategic initiatives required to deliver our long-term targets.\nCumulatively, since we began the savings program in 2022, we have reduced our cost base and delivered gross savings of $104 million. And we remain on track to deliver our in-year savings goal of $150 million. And finally, to round out the margin drivers, we had a negative 280 basis point impact in other items, which includes the $25 million impairment on the D&D film.\nAs Chris mentioned, we made significant progress in lowering inventory levels. We reduced total owned inventory 16% versus prior year, primarily driven by a 24% reduction in the Consumer Products segment inventory. We expect to see inventory reduction through the first part of Q3 and stabilizing to more normalized levels by the end of the year. From a retail inventory perspective, their inventory was also down 16%, and the lion's share of the directions are behind us.\nLooking more closely at segment performance within the quarter, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue was down 11%. Overall tabletop gaming revenue, which includes both MAGIC and D&D, declined 17% given the lease timing. The decline in tabletop was partially offset by 33% growth in digital gaming, including the addition of D&D Beyond, which we acquired last May, and growth in Arena.\nSegment margins declined in line with expectations driven by higher royalty expense and a step-up in investment to support future brand growth and product development. Moving to the Consumer Products segment. Total CP revenue was down 11% in the quarter, driven by declines in POS trends and the focus on clearing inventory.\nLooking at the key drivers for the quarter. Five points of the decline was driven by planned license exits. Another 3-point decline was driven by toy and game volume given the broad category trends and retailers taking a more focused approach with their inventories. Four points of decline came from pricing and mix, driven by additional closeout costs as we work through higher inventory levels.\nAnd finally, we achieved 1 point of growth from licensed consumer products as we reenergized focus on leveraging our IP across categories. In the quarter, the Entertainment segment declined 3%, primarily due to business exits late last year. This was partially offset by 3% growth in film and TV behind scripted TV growth as well as film revenue from Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.\nIn addition, Family Brands revenue increased 14% and driven by content sales, including for PEPPA PIG. The adjusted operating loss for the second quarter includes the $25 million Dungeon & Dragon: Honor Among Thieves production asset impairment charge. Today, we announced the sale of our eOne Film and TV business to Lionsgate.\nOverall, the business that we're selling represented approximately 85% of the revenue and just over 60% of the adjusted operating profit of the total Entertainment segment last year. Wrapping up with Hasbro, Inc., we delivered $119 million of operating cash year-to-date, which is $29 million behind last year, driven by lower receivables coming out of 2022.\nThrough June, we repaid $91 million of long-term debt and spent $112 million on capital expenditures, led by investments in Wizards of the Coast for future digital gaming releases. And we've returned $194 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends. In the quarter, we booked a 26.3% underlying tax rate, which compares to 21.6% in Q2 of last year.\nThe higher rate is driven by our entertainment business losses and higher withholding taxes plus a shift in the geographical mix of income. Additionally, we had $4.8 million of additional interest expense due to higher interest rates. Turning to our 2023 guidance.\nThe outlook across the Consumer Products segment remains on track and Wizards of the co-segment is better than original expectations. For the Entertainment segment, we are updating guidance to reflect the reality of the writers and actors strikes on our eOne film and TV business.\nThis updated guidance assumes film and TV is included for the entire fiscal year, and we will update once the close is complete. Based on this, we now expect total Hasbro Inc. revenue down 3% to 6%. As we look at the 3 primary segments, this guidance continues to assume that the CP business will be down mid-single digits, which is consistent with our initial outlook.\nWe are planning for POS trends to continue stabilizing in the back half of the year, and this, coupled with stronger execution, will result in modest back half revenue growth. We now expect that Wizards of the Coast will deliver high single-digit revenue growth compared to our original guidance of mid-single digits.\nWe are confident in the back half releases slated for MAGIC. And digital licensing should also be supported by the continued success of MONOPOLY GO and the upcoming release of the AAA role-playing game, Baldur's Gate 3. And finally, for entertainment, we are now expecting revenue declines of 25% to 30%, which incorporates the impact of the writers and actors strikes on production deliveries in the back half of the year.\nAdjusted operating margin is now expected to be up 20 to 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted operating margin. The margin outlook for CP and Wizards of the Coast are the same or better than our previous guidance. The guidance reflects unfavorable changes in entertainment given the strikes as well as the D&D impairments. This margin guidance continues to expect $150 million of in-year cost savings driven by our operational excellence program as well as assumes that the cost to clear inventory reduces in the back half of the year.\nDespite the headwind from the entertainment segment, we continue to expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be relatively flat to prior year. And based on our current forecast, we continue to expect to generate $600 million to $700 million of operating cash flow.\nFrom a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities are to invest behind the business, pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders via dividends. We expect to use the cash generated from the sale of the eOne film and TV to pay down debt, which will accelerate the reduction of our overall debt by a minimum of $400 million and advance our progress towards achieving our 2.5x long-term leverage target.\nIn terms of earnings per share, despite adjusted EBITDA guidance remaining unchanged the film and TV business has created additional volatility impacting below-the-line items, including interest expense and tax rate. Through the second quarter, film and TV has created an approximate $0.50 negative impact on earnings per share.\nAnd based on our updated outlook, we anticipate an additional $0.10 to $0.20 negative impact on the full year. Given this, as well as the divestiture, we are withdrawing total Hasbro, Inc. earnings per share guidance, and we'll revisit reintroducing the metric once we have closed the transaction.\nOur remaining segments are continuing to grow their EPS contribution versus original expectations and versus last year behind strong Wizards growth and cost savings momentum. I'm 3 months in at Hasbro. And every day, I am more excited about the opportunities ahead for this amazing company.\nWe have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver the year, but we are making progress in gaining momentum with today's announcement of the sale of the eOne film and TV business being the latest milestone. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris to wrap up.\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Gina. While our overall guidance is down for the year, the puts and takes are contained in the segment that we have found a better home for and a company adept at driving value. Our core business is making tangible progress.\nAnd while the next 6 months will present entertainment-related headwinds, we will emerge a more focused, more profitable and more predictable business. This will enable us to continue to fund our category-leading dividend, improve our balance sheet health and drive value for our shareholders, partners and fans of all ages. We'll now pause to take questions."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance. Then we will take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. Today's guidance assumes we retain the noncore entertainment film and TV business, notwithstanding the current marketing process. While there is no guarantee of such an outcome, if this process results in a sale, we will update our guidance. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.\nI would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Debbie, and good morning. Six months ago, we unveiled our strategy for Hasbro, highlighting 3 priorities: focusing on fewer bigger brands and initiatives; building our consumer insight to grow share and drive innovation; and improving operational excellence to fuel bottom-line health and strategic reinvestment. It's a plan that recenters Hasbro on what has made us great for the past 100 years and which will serve as our foundation going forward: Play.\nPut simply, play is what we do. And as we celebrate our 100th anniversary, 2023 is about refocusing our teams to drive renewed leadership in toys and games, rightsizing our entertainment investments and driving fundamental improvements in our organization to deliver long-term success. With our strategy top of mind, let's review our Q1 results.\nAs anticipated, Q1 revenue was lower year-over-year, but ahead of expectations, driven by continued positive performance of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and another strong growth quarter for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, a year-over-year decline of 14%. Adjusted operating profit was $47.2 million, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.01. Wizards and Digital Gaming net revenue increased 12% year-over-year, with growth in both Magic and D&D. MAGIC: THE GATHERING was a standout performer, growing 16%, particularly impressive given its 40% growth in Q4. The fundamentals of Magic, Hasbro's first billion-dollar brand are strong with new player growth, player engagement and player sentiment all pointing in the right direction.\nWe expect the positive momentum for Magic to continue with Q1 also seeing one of our most successful preorders ever for our upcoming Universes Beyond, The Lord of the Rings: Tales of the Middle-Earth set, which will launch in late Q2. Given our release calendar, we expect revenue for Magic to be down in Q2, but up solidly in Q3 and for the full year.\nConsumer Products revenue declined 23% year-over-year. Point of sale was down for the quarter but improved from Q4 despite exiting several unprofitable businesses and licenses. PLAY-DOH, PEPPA PIG and Hasbro Gaming saw POS gains in Q1. And we drove late quarter growth in Action, particularly in Transformers as excitement amounts for the June release of the TRANSFORMERS: Rise of the Beast feature film.\nBeyond Transformers, we have a blockbuster lineup of content from our partners' brands helping to support sales in the back half of the year, including Season 3 of Lucasfilm; The Mandalorian, Star Wars: Ahsoka, Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Sony's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Importantly, we ended the quarter with good progress on reducing retailer inventories and are on track for healthy improvements in our owned inventory in Q2 and Q3.\nEntertainment segment revenues were off 19%, driven by year-over-year shifts in release timing of new film and family brands content. Among new Hasbro content released, we debuted our new preschool brand, Kiya and the Kimoja Heroes on Disney Jr. and Disney+, and launched with our partners at Paramount, the new feature film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. D&D took the #1 spot to the global office in its release week and has become Hasbro's best reviewed film ever, with an impressive 91% critic score and 93% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Based on the strong fan and audience response, we are expecting Honor Among Thieves to enjoy a long viewing life that introduces our newest franchise brand to tens of millions of new consumers globally via theaters, streaming and post theatrical sales.\nOur operational excellence program continues apace. As we execute our plans, we expect the cost savings to grow over the coming quarters. In Q1, we achieved $35 million of cost savings. We continue to expect $150 million of run rate gross cost savings this year, money we are using to reinvest in the business, offset margin impacts from inventory management programs, and help us achieve our full year target of 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating profit improvement.\nWe made significant progress in recasting our leadership team to drive our strategy. Gina Goetter, the CFO of Harley-Davidson and 25-plus year consumer packaged goods veteran, joins us in May as our new CFO and leader of our global operations disciplines. Gina has a long history with corporate transformations, which will serve Hasbro well. Tim Kilpin, a 30-plus-year veteran with leadership experiences across marquee toy, games and entertainment brands, joins us as our new President of Toy, Licensing and Entertainment. Jason Bunge, the former Chief Marketing Officer of Riot Games, joins us as our new global CMO, bringing new marketing firepower for our games and data-driven growth initiatives.\nAnd Bertie Thompson, Chief Communications and Creative Officer at Notion and former Communications Executive at Meta, joins us as our new Chief Communications Officer, bringing cutting-edge technology, social media and financial markets communications expertise. These talented leaders joined an extended leadership team, hailing from technology, CPG, toys, games and entertainment companies to drive our strategy and build profitable blueprints across our Franchise and Partner Brands.\nOur growth initiatives continue to deliver. Hasbro's total games portfolio grew 2% in the quarter. Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 21%, led by a 46% increase at Hasbro Pulse, our fan-focused direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform. And on licensing, we just announced our first-ever agreement with Mattel, including crossovers for Barbie and MONOPOLY and Hot Wheels, UNO and Transformers. Partnerships like this, along with our previously announced licensing deals with LEGO on Transformers and D&D, expand our brands, introduce our toys and games into new categories and leverage our own category leadership for new growth opportunities.\nFor the full year, we are maintaining our previous guidance of a low single-digit revenue decline and adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points. We continue to expect Q2 to present headwinds as retailers return to traditional ordering and shipment patterns and release timings for new Magic sets favoring Q3 impacts Wizards of the Coast sales. We're cautiously optimistic with the progress we have made in Q1, but still maintain an outlook of a flat to down toy and games market where focus, share building and bottom line health are Hasbro priorities.\nOn the sale of our non Hasbro-branded E1 film and TV assets, we continue to be pleased by the progress and expect to provide an update in Q2. In summary, while Q1 is just the start, we delivered ahead of plan and continue to see steady progress in building our leadership team, focusing the company and improving our operational fundamentals. Magic is strong. The fan economy is proving resilient. Our entertainment calendar is robust, and our growth initiatives are on track.\nI'd now like to turn over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Deb Thomas, to share more details. Deb?\n\nDeborah M. Thomas\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Hasbro, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris said, first quarter results were ahead of our expectations and position us to meet our full year guidance. Wizards of the Coast, led by strong MAGIC: THE GATHERING demand, continued to perform well. Our consumer products teams are working through retail inventory and setting for major entertainment releases, and our operational excellence program is delivering savings and helping offset these expenses.\nAs you know, the first quarter is a historically small quarter for our business and most of the year remains ahead. In Q1, our fixed cost base is disproportionate to revenue. This impacts our profit early in the year, but we see improvement in future quarters as revenue grows and as we begin to actualize more of our cost savings. In Q1, we realized an additional $35 million in savings and remain on track to deliver $150 million of run rate savings in 2023. In addition, this is a 53-week fiscal year, and the first quarter holds that extra week. And this equaled $14 million of incremental expense on Little revenue.\nGiven our first quarter, we now expect revenue in the first half of 2023 to be down approximately 16% versus our previously forecasted 20% decline. For the full year, we continue to expect a low single-digit revenue decline in 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement.\nWe started the year with a cash balance of $513 million. $89 million of operating cash flow in the quarter was offset by nonoperating outflows, including $30 million of long-term debt repayment, $53 million of CapEx led by investments in Wizards of the Coast for future gaming releases and a $97 million return of capital through dividends to our shareholders. We ended Q1 with $386 million in cash. We forecast operating cash flow for the year in the $600 million to $700 million range. We have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to operate our business, meet our CapEx needs, invest for growth and fund our dividend.\nAt quarter end, inventory at Hasbro is up from year-end, due primarily to 2 items: the first being higher Wizards of the Coast inventories given the timing of releases this year, with March of the Machine release mid-April and Universes Beyond: The Lord of the Rings, Tales of the Middle-Earth shortly before the start of Q3. By year-end, we expect Wizards' inventories to be down. The second increase comes from our Consumer Product inventories. While we're working through our own inventory from year-end, we purchased Action figures to set at retail for upcoming entertainment launches, including Transformers: Rise of the Beast.\nWe made good progress reducing retail inventories in Q1, and they are down from year-end. We continue to expect it will take the first half of the year to work through the excess. The cost savings work we began last year are heavily weighted to our supply chain and are offsetting these costs, resulting in slightly better cost of sales margins compared to Q1 2022. Once we work through the inventory and our sales allowances return to normalized levels, we expect those cost savings will begin to drop to the bottom line. This should begin in the second half of the year.\nThe sale of the noncore TV and film assets is progressing. And while we expect to be able to provide an update on the transaction in the second quarter, a closing and related cash inflow is likely to happen in the second half of this year. We will prioritize the sale proceeds of the entertainment assets toward paying down debt, lowering our overall debt levels, reducing our ongoing interest expense and improving our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We continue to target debt-to-EBITDA of 2 to 2.5x, and we remain committed to our investment-grade rating.\nLooking at our adjusted results for the first quarter, revenue came in ahead of our plan, with strong MAGIC: THE GATHERING demand and slightly better shipments in our Consumer Products business. Foreign exchange had a negative $15.8 million impact on revenues. Cost of sales declined in line with revenue and decreased 10 basis points year-over-year. As I mentioned, the incremental expense for closeouts and allowances is being offset by operational excellence cost savings. Favorable product mix behind growth in Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue, as well as CP licensing, contributed to improvements in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue.\nProgram amortization expense declined on lower entertainment deliveries in the year, but increased 30 basis points as a percent of revenue. Royalty expense declined on lower partner brand revenues as we exited certain licenses and, to a lesser extent, from lower E1 revenues in title mix. In the second quarter, operating profit will be impacted as we expect royalty expense of approximately 10% of revenue. This is an additional $45 million versus Q1 as we ship products in support of Transformers: Rise of the Beast and MAGIC, Universes Beyond: The Lord of the Rings set. For the full year, we expect royalty expense to decline from 8.4% in 2022.\nProduct development expense increased due to team supporting our Wizards of the Coast tabletop and digital development who joined the company in the back half of last year. Advertising investment increased on support for Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves within our Entertainment segment, and at Wizards of the Coast for both D&D and MAGIC. Adjusted SG&A spend was essentially flat but increased as a percentage of revenue. Lower freight costs and cost savings from mid-Q1 workforce reductions were offset by higher investment in Wizards including personnel, organized play events such as conventions and tournaments and marketing for upcoming releases.\nAs a reminder, we expect to achieve more normalized levels of incentive compensation in 2023 throughout the year, which we estimate to be approximately $80 million versus 2022, with $65 million in SG&A and the balance in product development. Due to the mix of earnings and lower income in the quarter, combined with discrete items mostly related to stock-based compensation, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter at 83.8% is not indicative of the year. The outsized impact from small discrete items will normalize with higher income. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect our underlying adjusted rate to be between 20% and 21%.\nLooking at our segments, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue increased 14% in constant currency. The team is focused on creating gaming experiences MAGIC and D&D fans embrace. Tabletop revenues were up 13% behind popular MAGIC: THE GATHERING releases. Digital Gaming revenue increased 9%, led by the addition of D&D beyond. As we continue to invest in Wizards of the Coast, operating profit declined 28% due to higher product costs, product development, personnel costs, advertising expense and costs supporting the return of organized play. We continue to expect full year operating profit margin for the segment in the high 30% range, which reflects investment for future growth and expansion of our Universes Beyond products.\nConsumer Products segment revenue decreased 21%, excluding a negative $8.3 million impact of foreign exchange, $6.2 million of which was in Europe. This performance was led by lower revenues in North America and Europe, partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and licensing. The segment's adjusted operating loss is the result of lower net revenue and includes higher allowances and closeouts to sell-through inventory. We expect these higher costs to continue in the second quarter. These items were partially offset by savings realized from the company's operational excellence program reflected primarily in cost of sales.\nEntertainment segment revenue decreased 17% in constant currency. TV revenues increased behind scripted TV deliveries including the new series, The Rookie: Feds and The Rookie, which ABC just renewed for a sixth season; Yellowjackets; and The Recruit, and lower unscripted TV revenue. Film revenues declined with fewer new releases in 2023 versus 2022. Family Brands revenue declined due to content sales timing year-over-year, including several multiyear licensing deals executed in Q1 2022 that did not repeat this year. Music and other decline as we exited the remainder of these businesses in late 2022. Adjusted operating loss was the result of lower revenues as well as higher advertising for Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, partially offset by lower royalty expense.\nAs I said upfront, Q1 was a good but small quarter with a lot of the year ahead of us. Our outlook is predicated on the second half that improves year-over-year. We remain cautious about the macro and the consumer environment, but the timing of theatrical releases, a strong MAGIC release schedule, the return to a more traditional and back half weighted shipment plan to retailers, innovation we have planned and we'll share more about this summer and engaging retail and advertising campaigns to improve point-of-sale all support our view.\nIt's hard to imagine that this is my last earnings call as Hasbro's CFO. I have been here for 25 years, and we've been through the good and the tough. I've had the opportunity to work with outstanding people on amazing brands, and I know Chris, Gina and Tim and our entire team will take good care of Hasbro and its legacy. Thank you all for your support of Hasbro and for your partnership over the years.\nNow one last time, I'll turn it back to Chris.\n\nChristian Cocks\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Deb. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to spend a minute thanking Deb Thomas for her 25 years of leadership at Hasbro. I started this company 7 years ago as the fresh-faced leader of an under-the-radar subsidiary called Wizards of the Coast. From my first day on the job, there was no bigger supporter of Wizards than Deb. She got it, and was always there for Rookie, helping me navigate the broader company and giving me and the team at Wizards the support we needed to turbocharge that business.\nMy story is the same story thousands of people across the company have about Deb. She is the true definition of a servant leader: The first one in the office in the morning; the last one to turn the lights off in the evening; and a true believer in the power of our people and brands. Deb has been an invaluable partner who has helped Hasbro become one of the biggest and best companies in the toys and games and broader entertainment industry.\nDeb, it's been an honor to work with, partner and learn from you over the years. Our company and our shareholders owe you a debt gratitude. On behalf of everyone at Hasbro, and especially me, thank you.\nNow we will take your questions."

My name is Courtney, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note that this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) And I will now hand you over to your host, David Phillips, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nDavid Ian Phillips\n\nHead of IR, Hays plc\n\nThank you, Courtney, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Hays' quarterly update call for the 3 months ended 30th June 2022, the fourth quarter of our 2022 financial year. I'm here with Paul Venables, Group Finance Director.\nBefore we begin, please be aware that this call is being recorded with the recording accessible using the number and code provided in the release. Please be aware that our discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs as well as assumptions on future events. There are risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements.\nHays disclaims any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements that have been made during this call regardless of whether these statements are affected as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I'll now hand you over to Paul.\n\nPaul Venables\n\nCFO, Group Finance Director & Executive Director, Hays plc\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I'll present highlights and key themes of today's update and discuss regional performances before taking questions.\nAs usual, all net fee growth percentages on a like-for-like basis versus prior year unless stated otherwise.\nSo let's start with the performance overview. We finished our financial year strongly, delivering record quarterly net fees in Q4, up 23%.\nOverall, group fees and activity levels were sequentially stable through the quarter and clients and candidate confidence remained at high levels. Currency translation had a positive impact, increasing headline net fees by 1% and there were no material working day adjustments in the period.\nI'd highlight the following key features. One, we delivered quarterly fee records in 15 countries, including an excellent performance in our largest business of Germany. Two, growth in all of our major markets is again led by Perm up 31%, with Temp up at strong 16%, and we saw further margin improvements in both Temp and Perm. The private sector, up 26%, again, significantly outperformed the public sector, up 7%.\nThree, our largest global specialism of Technology, which is 26% of group fees, delivered another record quarter with fees up 24% and exceeded GBP 300 million of net fees in FY '22. Our Enterprise Solutions business also produced another record quarter with direct outsourcing fees, up 30%.\nFour, overall, group fees and activity levels were sequentially stable through the quarter, and the group net fee exit rate of June was 19%. Five, consultant productivity remained at high levels, despite increasing consultant head count by 5% in the quarter.\nSix, as a result of all of the previous points, group operating profit for the year ended 30th of June is expected to be at circa GBP 210 million at the top end of our previous guidance range given at Q3 FY '22. And of course, this includes the one-off cost of exiting our Russia business, which is now complete.\nAnd seven, cash performance was strong. We ended the quarter in a robust financial position with net cash of GBP 295 million, which is also after GBP 18 million in share buybacks in Q4. And this strong cash performance supports the Board's commitment to returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nI'll now comment on the performance by each region in more detail. ANZ. Our ANZ division, 17% of group fees, increased by 12% with fee activity levels sequentially stable through the quarter. Perm, 41% of ANZ fees, was up an excellent 33%, whilst Temp increased by 2% with volume stable across the quarter.\nIn the Private Sector, which is 65% of fees, increased by 13%, whilst Public sector grew by 11%. Australia fees increased by 11%, again led by Queensland up 22%. And our 2 largest industries, Construction Property and Technology grew 11% and 21%, respectively.\nNew Zealand, 8% of ANZ fees, continued its strong run and increased by an excellent 33%. And consultant head count in ANZ increased by 3% in the quarter and 20% year-on-year.\nGermany. Germany, our largest business, representing 27% of group net fees, delivered another record fee performance, up 29%, with record Contractor volumes and continued strong activity levels. Contracting, 55% of German fees, delivered a record quarter. Fees grew by 32%, driven by 29% growth in contractor volumes, which ended the quarter at record levels.\nAnd margin and fee mix increased fees by a further 9%, partially offset by 6% lower average weekly hours per contractor. Temp, 27% of Germany fees, was up 17%, and Perm delivered another excellent performance, up 39%.\nAt the specialism level, Technology, our largest specialism, was up 15%; engineering, 32%; and Accountancy & Finance, up 44%. Consultant head count increased by 6% in the quarter and 24% year-on-year.\nU.K. and Ireland. The U.K. and Ireland, which is 21% of group fees, increased by 22%, with fees stable through the quarter. Performance was led by Perm, 47% of UK&I fees, up an excellent 43%. Temp was up 8%, with higher margins, offset by slightly lower volumes.\nPrivate Sector fees increased by 34% with the Public sector down 2%. Most regions traded broadly in line with the overall business apart from the South West & Wales and the East of England, which grew by 33% and 28%, respectively.\nAnd Northern Ireland and the North West, which grew by 5% and 14%, respectively. Our largest region of London increased by 18%, including London City, up 40%. At the specialism level, we again saw excellent growth in Technology, up 35%. And Accounting & Finance, our largest specialism, up 31%, while Construction & Property grew by 7%.\nIreland delivered another excellent performance with fees up 59% and consultant head count overall increased by 7% in the quarter and 24% year-on-year.\nRest of the World. Rest of the World, which represents 35% of group fees and comprises 27 countries grew by 24%, with 14 countries delivering quarterly records. Perm, which is 67% of fees increased by 25%, with Temp up 22%.\nIn EMEA ex-Germany, fees increased by 21% and activity levels remained strong. Our largest Rest of World country, France, increased by 31%, with Spain up 26%. Italy and Poland both increased, up 37%, and each delivered a fee record. The growth was slower in Belgium, up 6%. The Americas grew by 33%, with fee records in Canada, up an excellent 64% and Latin America as a subregion up 45%, and fees in the U.S. increased by 20%.\nIn Asia, fees increased by 19%, with record fees in Japan, up 65% and another excellent performance in Malaysia, up 27%. China decreased by 5%, with strict pandemic-related restrictions weighing heavily on Mainland China through the quarter. Consultant head count was up 5% in the quarter and 29% year-on-year.\nCash flow and balance sheet. Cash generation was again strong, and we ended the year with net cash of GBP 295 million. The Board is committed to returning significant cash to shareholders over a GBP 100 million cash buffer via core and special dividends and buybacks.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased and canceled 15.4% -- sorry, 15.4 million shares at an average price of 118p and this left a residual balance on the buyback from GBP 57 million.\nAnd as a reminder, the Board will add any residual amount of our share buyback program to the GBP 100 million cash buffer in calculating any FY '22 special.\nSo coming on to current trading and guidance, and I'd make 4 points before an overall conclusion firstly, while we're mindful of increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, clients and candidate confidence remains at good overall levels with continued skill shortages, supportive margin dynamics and rising wage inflation globally.\nOverall -- two, overall, the group fees and activities are sequentially stable at high levels with signs of some market normalization, particularly in the hottest part of the Perm market. But overall, this remains a very good market.\nThree, after significant investment in Consultant headcount over the last 6 months, we expect growth to moderate to 1% to 2% over the next quarter, mainly in our strategic growth initiatives. In FY '23, as I've said previously, our focus will be on driving productivity whilst continuing selective investments in structural growth markets.\nAnd four, we anticipate the group's effective tax rate will benefit from one-off items in FY '22 and will be materially below our previous guidance of 30%. But we expect tax rate to return to circa 30% in FY '23.\nSo in conclusion, we've had a strong end to our financial year and are firmly focused on driving profitable cash-generative growth and increasing consultant productivity. Although the increase in macroeconomic uncertainties are clear, our market-leading position, strong brand, highly experienced management teams and our financial strength mean we are confident we can deliver our long-term objectives.\nAnd with that, I'll hand you back to the administrator, and we're happy to take your questions."

My name is Judy, and I'll be the coordinator for today's event. Please note that this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I will now hand you over to your host, David Phillips, Head of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nDavid Ian Phillips\n\nHead of IR, Hays plc\n\nThank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Hays' quarterly update call for the 3 months ended 31st March 2022, our third quarter of the '22 financial year. I'm here with Paul Venables, Group Finance Director.\nBut before we begin, please be aware that this call is being recorded with the recording accessible using the number and code provided in the release. Please be aware that our discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs as well as assumptions on future events. There are risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Hays disclaims any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements that have been made on this call, regardless of whether these statements are affected as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. I'll now hand you over to Paul.\n\nPaul Venables\n\nCFO, Group Finance Director & Executive Director, Hays plc\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I'll present the highlights and key themes of today's update and discuss regional performances before we take your questions. As usual, all net figures and percentages are on a like-for-like basis versus prior year, unless stated otherwise.\nPerformance overview. In Q3, we delivered record quarterly fees, up 32% with excellent growth in all regions and an all-time fee record in March. Currency translation had a negative impact, decreasing headline net fees by 3%, and there were no material working days adjustments in the period.\nI highlight the following key features: one, we delivered quarterly fee records in 19 countries, including a standout performance in our largest business in Germany and in the strategically important markets of the U.S.A. and France.\nTwo, growth was led by Perm at 48% and Temp by 21%, both excellent results.\nThe private sector up 35%, again significantly outperformed the public sector, which is up 15%. Comparing to pre-pandemic fee levels, fees in the quarter were 11% above Q3 FY '19.\nFour, specialism level & Technology, our largest global specialism, and now 26% of group fees, delivered another record performance with fees up 35%.\nFive, consultant productivity remained at near record levels despite increasing consultant head count on a headline basis by 4% or 325 in the quarter.\nSix, our net fee exit rate in March was 26% despite a 16% tougher year-on-year growth comparative.\nSeven, during the quarter and as previously announced, due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Hays ceased trading and exited Russia. In half 1 FY '22, Russia represented about 1% or GBP 5.9 million of group net fees and GBP 0.8 million of operating profit. We provided GBP 5 million of one-off closure costs, which we'll incur as an expense above the line in half 2 FY '22.\nEight, we reiterate the guidance given at our half year results for FY '22 operating profit of between GBP 210 million to GBP 215 million, excluding this one-off Russia impact.\nNine, finally, cash performance was strong and we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with net cash of GBP 240 million, in line with our expectations.\nI'll now comment on the performance by each division in more detail. Our ANZ division, which is 16% of group fees, increased by 24%, with activity stronger in March, as pandemic impact eased, particularly in Perm. Perm, which represents 40% of ANZ fees, was up an excellent 57%; whilst Temp increased by 9%, against a relatively resilient performance last year.\nPrivate sector, 66% of fees, increased by 28%, whilst public sector grew by 18%. Australia increased by 21%, led by Queensland up 28%. And our 2 largest specialisms: Construction & Property and Technology grew by 14% and 42%, respectively. New Zealand, 9% of ANZ fees delivered a fee record and increased by an excellent 62%.\nConsultant headcount in ANZ increased by 4% in the quarter and 26% year-on-year. Germany, our largest business representing 27% of group fees, delivered another record quarter, up 32%, and included a record in March. Overall business confidence was stable with clients continuing to invest in new and extended existing projects. Contracting 55% of German fees delivered a record quarter. Fees grew by 31%, driven by 29% growth in contractor volumes, which ended the quarter at record levels.\nMargin and fee mix increased fees by a further 8%, partially offset by 6% lower average weekly hours per contractor. Temp, which is mainly in the engineering and manufacturing sectors, continued to recover, up 28%. Although given slower recovery in Automotive, parts of the manufacturing sectors remained 10% below pre-pandemic levels.\nPerm delivered an excellent performance of 43% and consultant headcount increased by 9% in the quarter and 19% year-on-year. The U.K. and Ireland, 22% of group fees, increased by 29%. Thereby excellent Perm performance of 59%, and Temp up 13%.\nPrivate sector fees increased by 40%, with the public sector, which was resilient in the prior year, up 9%. Most regions traded broadly in line with the overall business apart from the Northwest and Southeast, which grew by 49% and 41%, respectively. Our largest U.K. region of London grew by 28%, including London City, which is predominantly private sector focused, up an excellent 57%.\nIreland delivered another excellent performance with fees 61%. At the specialism level, we again saw excellent growth in technology of 52%, as we did in HR and education at 52% and 50%, respectively. Accountancy & Finance, our largest U.K. business, grew by 35%, and C&P 16%. Consultant headcount increased by 4% in the quarter and 24% year-on-year.\nRest of the World, representing 35% of group fees and comprising 27 countries, grew by 36% with 17 countries delivering quarterly fee records. Perm, which is 68% of Rest of the world fees, increased by 43%, with Temp up 24%. In EMEA ex-Germany, fees increased by 33% and activity levels remained high. Ten countries delivered record quarterly fees, including our largest Rest of the World country, France, up 38%; Spain, 46%; Poland, 39%; and Switzerland, up 28%.\nThe Americas grew by 54% with records in all countries in the region, including the USA, our second largest country, at 47%; Canada, 64%; and Brazil, 78%. Asia fees increased by 27%, with standout performances in Malaysia at 53%; and Japan, which showed improves momentum, with fees up 42%.\nChina grew by 10% and growth slowed through the quarter as strict pandemic restrictions were reintroduced. Consultant headcount was up 1% in the quarter and 34% year-on-year.\nCash flow and balance sheet. Cash collection was good and we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with net cash of GBP 240 million, in line with our expectations.\nCurrent trading and guidance. I'd make the following points: one, whilst we're mindful of increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, client and candidate confidence remains strong with continued skill shortages and rising wage inflation globally, especially at the higher salary levels. The group's activity levels remain strong.\nTwo, after significant investments in consultant headcount over the last 12 months, we expect investment to moderate to 1% to 3% over the next quarter with headcount growth in Germany and in our strategic growth initiatives, which continue to perform strongly. Consultant productivity remains at near record levels, and we expect to increase this further in FY '23 and beyond.\nAnd three, on 28th of April 2022, we'll be hosting an Investor Day in London, focusing on the significant structural growth opportunities we see across many markets. We look forward to seeing many of you in person on the day, but we'll also be live webcasting the event, the details of which are in our Q3 statement.\nIn conclusion, we are focused on driving further profitable growth as we pursue our route to exceeding previous peak profit levels supported by our strong brand, highly experienced management team globally, and our financial strength. We're firmly focused on positioning Hays as a clear market leader in the most attractive long-term sectors and geographies, including Technology and Germany. I'll now hand you back to the administrator, and we're happy to take your questions."

Welcome to the interim results for the 6 months of the first half of 2022 ended on the 31st of December conference call. (Operator Instructions) I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today on Thursday, the 24th of February 2022. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Alistair Cox. Please go ahead.\n\nAlistair Richard Cox\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Hays plc\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to our half year results.\nClearly, we're very mindful of the situation that's unfolding as we speak in the Ukraine, but it's too early to comment on that. We're here today to talk about our first half year results, and that's a good story. It's one of our record fees, the fastest profit growth in our history and an upgrade to our FY '22 profit expectations.\nAs usual, I'll take you through the operating review. Paul will then cover the detailed financials and our current trading. And then I'll finish off with an update on our strategy.\nThe pandemic has obviously changed so many things in our lives, in the world of work and in our business. There's just too much going on to talk about everything today, but we'll elaborate more in our Investor Day on April 28.\nSuffice to say though, employers are changing what they're looking for, where they recruit from, and they're also making faster hiring decisions. Employees are taking career decisions at a pace faster than we've ever seen before. Working conditions have transformed with the new normal of hybrid and remote working. And the demand for talent combined with insufficient supply in many areas is leading now to major skill shortages. And that is driving up the price of skilled labor, with real wage inflation evident for the first time in a decade.\nThat scale of change in the world of work brings us massive opportunities, but it also means that we ourselves have had to change faster than ever before to capitalize on those opportunities. And that's the next chapter of our story. With so much activity going on in the world of work, we've never been busier nor our purpose more relevant. Over the last 6 months, we've helped over 150,000 people find new jobs. And we've delivered almost 0.5 million online training courses to candidates looking to upgrade their skills for the new economy.\nAnd with such confidence in the job market, we've invested aggressively to both grow our consultant capacity faster than ever before as well as repositioning our business towards those areas where we see the most significant longer-term opportunity. That investment, combined with a confident market backdrop, drove both record half year fees as well as a sharp recovery in profit, up fourfold to GBP 101.6 million. With that performance and the continued momentum that we see everywhere, we've now upgraded our expectations again. And we now believe full year profits are on track to be in the GBP 210 million to GBP 215 million range, which is ahead of current expectations.\nIt's not just about the profit though. We've also made some great progress in our societal priorities. We're now a carbon-neutral company. We're well underway with our planning to be net 0. We brought major career training programs to our markets, free of charge, to help people get on in their lives and promote social mobility.\nAnd linked to that, our Hays Health charitable work is bringing our expertise and networks to new communities where people have traditionally not been able to access our capabilities to, again, help thousands of people create something better for themselves in life.\nAnd then finally, for our shareholders, having delivered a strong profit recovery, we've continued to generate significant cash and have proposed an interim core dividend of 0.95p per share after we paid GBP 170 million in dividends just last November. We also expect to announce a further substantial dividend at our full year results in August.\nAnd I have to say that after almost 15 years as CEO here, we've not had a set of results for all of our stakeholders quite like this, but I do think that we've also got a lot further to go.\nSo let me turn then to our financial results. Group fees were up 39% to a record half year level of GBP 565 million. 21 of our 33 countries produced half year records. And September and November were all-time monthly highs. The sheer uniformity of this global recovery has been unprecedented and I think quite remarkable.\nOur Perm business was outstanding with fees up 62%. Temp, which, if you remember, was relatively resilient in the prior year, still grew by 25% off a higher base. Activity levels in both sectors were very strong.\nLooking by industry, our largest business, Technology, grew 35% globally and in our second quarter with 20% above pre-pandemic highs as the results of our earlier investments came through. Accountancy & Finance was up strongly, up 41%. And even though its recovery started slightly later, our Construction & Property business grew by 26%.\nGrowing in the enterprise organization market is also a core plank of our strategy. And Hays Talent Solutions grew by 1/3 as we continued to take market share and is now more than 1/5 larger than at its previous peaks.\nWe've started to rapidly increase our own headcount to capitalize on the recovery around a year ago, and that investment accelerated in our first half. We added well over 1,000 new consultants in the last 6 months which takes us to over 1,700 additions in the last year. Despite these headcount additions, consultant productivity was excellent. And with so much latent capacity now moving up the productivity curve, we're underpinning our future fee growth. And with such a strong improvement in fees, our operating profit grew faster than we've ever experienced, and it consistently exceeded our expectations. Group operating profit of GBP 101.6 million was 7% more than we made in all of last year and represented 45% sequential growth on our second half last year.\nThose profits only tell part of the story though. I think each business has delivered on many more fronts. So let me give you additional color on each division, and we'll start over in Australia and New Zealand.\nAs everywhere, growth in ANZ was strong and momentum improved as lockdown restrictions eased during the half. Fees grew by 1/3, and operating profit by 60% year-on-year, that's 14% up sequentially versus the second half last year. Perm fees were up 86%. And temp, which again was more resilient a year ago, it was up 14%. Business confidence steadily improved. And skill shortages were acute, not helped by the borders remaining closed. Technology fees hit a record, up 45%. And A&F, office support and HR all recovered very strongly, up 35%, 48% and 58 -- 56%, respectively.\nI think a special shout out is due to our team in New Zealand who delivered a huge record, with fees up 56%. If you remember, we put new leadership into New Zealand 3 years ago, and I'm delighted that they have returned this business to where it belongs as a market leader, with more to come. And finally, with demand activity and momentum all so strong, we increased consultant headcount by 12% in the half year and 29% year-on-year.\nTurning now to our largest country, Germany. In a world of record performances, arguably, this was our standout performer. Fees were up 38% in what is already a massive business. And operating profit up 317%, that's 63% up on the second half last year. Overall, business confidence was high, with clients increasingly investing in new projects as well as extending existing ones.\nOur largest business of contracting produced its own half year record with fees up 22% and record numbers of contractors working. Temp growth was faster still, up 36% on an underlying basis. And Germany simply needs more highly skilled contracting and temp talent. And as the leader in this space, we'll continue to open up that market. And then in the Perm world, the Perm market growth was also excellent up 57%. And with such strong activity in markets, we increased consultant headcount by 8% in the half and 12% year-on-year. Overall, I'm very happy with our progress in Germany. And they hit a record fee level in November, which shows just how well they're doing. I said at last year's prelims that Germany is our biggest profit growth opportunity over the next 2 years.\nSo it's very reassuring to see the results coming through already. There are decades of structural opportunity to go for though, which is why I believe Germany remains the most exciting long-term recruitment opportunity in our world to date. We'll demonstrate that at our Investor Day as we already start from a leadership position, and we intend to double down on that.\nAnd then moving to the U.K. and Ireland. Fees increased by 39%. And profit grew by over GBP 19 million year-on-year and was up 46% versus our second half last year. Again, Perm fees led the way, up an excellent 69%, with Temp up 21% just as we saw in other markets. Conditions in the private sector was strong with fees up 52% and the public sector grew by 16%. By sector, again, a familiar theme as technology continued to hit new records, fees up 50%, off an already significant business. A&F, office support and HR were also excellent, up 46%, 80% and 123%, respectively, while CMP grew by 20%. And again, we increased consultant headcount by 11% in the first half and by 23% year-on-year as we invested into the recovery.\nAnd then finally, our Rest of World division comprises of 28 countries, and 20 of them delivered fee records. Fees were up 43%, with operating profit up GBP 21 million year-on-year or up 70% versus the second half last year. Perm fees again led the way, up 55%, with Temp up 23%. Regionally, EMEA, which is over half of this division, grew by 35%, with consistent growth across countries. The Americas were stronger, up 60%, led by the States and Brazil. And Asia was also excellent, up 49%, led by China.\nWe've got plenty of structural growth opportunities across the Rest of the World. And we increased headcount by 22% in the half and by 36% year-on-year. But there's a long runway ahead to build ever greater scale across the entire division, and we'll continue to invest to deliver on that promise.\nSo in summary, I think we've come a long way this half. To be back at record fees so quickly and with profits rebounding so fast, we find ourselves in a very strong position. The recovery in our performance is uniform globally, underpinned by high levels of client and candidate confidence. With skill shortages becoming more acute, with wage inflation becoming more widespread and with our investment program delivering results and with more to come, we're now raising our ambition. And as we stand here today, we see FY '22 operating profit of between GBP 210 million to GBP 215 million, ahead of consensus expectations.\nI'll now hand over to Paul for a deeper look at our financial performance and an overview on current trading.\n\nDavid Ian Phillips\n\nHead of IR, Hays plc\n\nJust quickly before Paul starts, this is David Phillips, Head of IR. We gather that the phone line is working okay, but the Internet audio may be struggling. Could I ask the moderator to just double check what is going? Slides are appearing on the website, but audio is not accompanying. We'll continue with the call as is because the phone line is apparently working. But could, moderator, please check the Internet audio ASAP?\n\nPaul Venables\n\nCFO, Group Finance Director & Executive Director, Hays plc\n\nWell, thank you, Alistair, and David. And good morning, everyone.\nStarting with the highlights of the financial review. To set the context of the record fees and excellent profit growth we're reporting today, it's worth a quick reminder of trading trends over the last 3 years. Global economic conditions have been slowing well before the pandemic, as can be seen in the trends in our fees from Q3 FY '19 to Q2 FY '20. As the pandemic unfolded in Q3 and especially Q4 FY '20, severe restrictions and lockdowns caused the fastest decline in our 53-year history.\nWe entered FY '21 with fees sequentially stable. And as restrictions eased, client activity and fees started to improve and accelerated, with strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 FY '21. Coming on to the current year, we entered FY '22 with good momentum in all our regions. We delivered good sequential fee growth in all divisions versus half 2 FY '21, an all-time record fee months in September and then November 2021.\nFinally, as can be seen in the graph, whilst Perm was heavily impacted during the initial stages of pandemic and the sequential growth in Temp was stronger in the initial stages of recovery, from March '21 onwards, the recovery has been increasingly Perm dominated as clients and candidate confidence improved to unprecedented levels. Overall, our recovery and performance in both Perm and Temp have been excellent.\nThis slide summarizes an excellent half year performance with like-for-like -- record like-for-like fees and a strong rebound in profit and cash position. Net fees increased by 39% on a like-for-like basis and our Q2 fees were up 11% versus pre-pandemic levels. For information, the fee numbers shown on the left-hand side are headline fees. But on a like-for-like exchange rate basis, half 1 FY '22 is GBP 17 million higher than half 1 FY '19.\nOperating profit quadrupled to GBP 101.6 million and was 45% higher than half 2 FY '21 despite the significant investments in the half. We delivered another good cash performance with net cash of GBP 237 million and GBP 170 million of dividends in November, and we upgraded profit expectations in January 2022 in these interims.\nMoving on to the income statement. Turnover increased by 15%, with the difference between turnover and fee growth, primarily driven by excellent growth in our Perm fees and the significant improvement in Temp margin. The difference between headline and like-for-like growth rates is primarily the result of the strengthening of sterling versus our main trading currencies of the euro and the Australian dollar. Overall, FX movements reduced net fees and operating profits of GBP 15.8 million and GBP 1.3 million, respectively. Earnings per share is 4.08p, a 444% increase versus prior year, driven by the significant increase in profit and the effect of lower group effective tax rate.\nAlistair covered regional trading earlier, and I'll just pick up 2 specific points. Firstly, an update on our German Temp business, where as required under German law, we implied -- employed temp workers. Temp fees increased by 75% on a headline basis. However, our comparative fees in half 1 FY '21 included GBP 6.2 million in temp severance and underutilization costs. Excluding this, underlying temp fees increased by 36%. Average temp volumes improved through the half but remained 18% below previous peaks, mainly due to slower recovery in the automotive and manufacturing sectors.\nAnd secondly, the 22% increase in German contracting business, which included a record quarter in Q2, was driven by strong accelerating growth in contractor volumes. Volumes in Q2 were 10% above prior peak levels, although this was partially offset by 5% lower average weekly hours per contractor, with an increasing number of part-time assignments over the last 2 years.\nMoving on to look at the performances of Perm and Temp. Our Perm business, 44% of net fees, increased by 62%, with a 58% increase in volume and 3% increase in our average Perm fee, primarily in Q2 as wage inflation increased. Our Temp business, 56% of group net fees, increased by 25% due to 4 factors: a volume increase of 13%; a 3% positive effect of mix, driven by higher paid specialisms, such as Technology and Life Sciences and also wage inflation; minimal German tech severance and utilization costs, as explained earlier; and finally and most importantly, 80 basis points or 6% increase in underlying margin, driven by improvements in pricing and wage inflation, the first increase in temp margin since FY '15.\nOn this slide, we set out the operating profit bridge between half 1 FY '21 and FY '22. Starting with half year FY '21 profit of GBP 25.1 million, we subtract the negative impact of exchange on profit of GBP 1.3 million and add the 39% increase in like-for-like fees of GBP 158.3 million, explained by Alistair earlier. Like-for-like costs increased by GBP 80.5 million or 21%, comprising staff costs at GBP 69.1 million, of which 40% related to the year-on-year increase in our average headcount, driven by investments in our consultant base, which is 24% higher than 12 months ago. But note, this excludes SGI investment. And 29% of higher commissions paid to consultants, this was driven by the GBP 158 million increase in fees and also 100 basis point increase in average commission percentage paid to consultants, driven by the excellent level of consultant productivity, most notably in our Perm business.\nWe invested GBP 8 million in strategic growth initiatives, an incremental GBP 4 million higher than prior year. And finally, as restrictions eased, travel and entertainment costs increased by GBP 2.6 million. And we incurred modest increases in advertising, IT and professional costs, partially offset by savings on property.\nWe entered the half with a periodic cost base of GBP 70 million and exited the half of GBP 78 million per period. And clearly, additional investment in SGI and Germany will increase the cost base further in the second half.\nAs a reminder, the P&L is sensitive to changes in key exchange rates, namely the Australian dollar and especially the euro. The group does not undertake any P&L translation hedging arrangements. Sterling strengthening versus our main currencies is a headwind to FY '22 profit. If we retranslate FY '21 profits of GBP 95 million at current exchange rates, profits will decline by GBP 7 million. However, given our operating profit will increase significantly in FY '22, FX movements are highly likely to have a much larger negative impact on FY '22 profits.\nMoving on to conversion rates. Group conversion rates increased from 5.9% to 18%, reflecting a strong sequential improvements in profitability despite significant investments in consult headcount. This represented a good drop -- like-for-like drop-through rate of incremental fees to profits of 49%, in line with our expectations as we balance driving profitability and investing for growth. For the full year, we expect a drop-through rate of 45% to 50%, with a slightly lower drop-through in the second half as our current cost base has the full impact of half 1 consultant additions. And in the second half, we'll invest further in SGI Projects and Germany.\nAt the regional level, especially encouraging is the strong sequential growth achieved in our German business as the higher value and longer length of contracting and temp assignments offers the greatest opportunity for profit growth in the group over the next few years. Germany delivered the biggest step change in profitability in the half, with the conversion rate increasing to 25%, an excellent drop-through of 70%. And whilst the drop through was slightly lower in the second half, the added investment we'll make in Germany will drive strong fee and profit growth in FY '23 and beyond. And finally, we continue to expect a drop-through rate of around or above 50% in FY '23 and are confident will drive our conversion rate back to pre -- back and beyond pre-pandemic levels in the next 2 to 3 years.\nMoving on to interest and tax. The net finance charge for the half decreased to GBP 3.9 million. The largest component remains a noncash IFRS 16 interest on lease liabilities. And looking ahead, we expect the net finance charge for the full year to be GBP 8 million, of which GBP 7 million is noncash. Our effective tax rate decreased from 40% to 30%. And the ETR reflects the group's geographic mix of profits, with a strong recovery of profit in countries with relatively low tax rates, such as the U.K., plus utilization of tax losses in certain countries. We expect the ETR in FY '22 to be around 30%.\nOn this slide, we've summarized the key components of our cash flow. The chart on the left details our sources of cash flow, starting with profit of GBP 101.6 million. We add back noncash items of GBP 40.9 million, predominantly IFRS 16 property depreciation, other fixed asset depreciation and amortization and share-based payments. We then subtract a working capital outflow of GBP 79.3 million, in line with our expectations and reflecting growth in our Temp book, plus some normalization in client payment terms. And we've ended up lease payments of GBP 23.9 million. This leaves an operating cash flow of GBP 39.3 million, representing an underlying conversion of profits into cash of 39%. From this, we paid tax of GBP 11.6 million and net interest of GBP 0.4 million, leading to free cash flow of GBP 27.3 million.\nOn the right-hand slide, we detail how the cash has been used. The main items were: the payment of GBP 170 million of core and special dividends in November; purchase of our own shares of GBP 11.6 million to satisfy employee-based share payment awards over the next 2 years; CapEx of GBP 9.9 million; and pension deficit payments of GBP 8.6 million. And for the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be GBP 25 million. This good cash performance meant we finished the half with a strong cash position of GBP 236.9 million. The group has in place a GBP 210 million revolving credit facility that reduces in November '24 to GBP 170 million and expires in 2025.\nOn this slide, we compare the balance sheet as of December and June 2021. The 2 main movements were: firstly, an increase in IAS 19 pension accounting surplus to GBP 95 million due to higher asset values, changes in assumptions on scheme demographics and company contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate and an increase in inflation expectations; and secondly, the increase in working capital as explained earlier. And finally, the 2021 triennial valuation has been completed and quantified the actuarial deficit at GBP 24 million. There's no change to our deficit recovery payments of GBP 17 million in FY '22, which will increase at 3% per year.\nOur priorities for free cash flow remain unchanged, namely to fund the group's investment and development, maintain a strong balance sheet, deliver a sustainable and appropriate core dividend, and to return surplus cash via the payment of special dividends to shareholders. In line with this policy, the Board has declared an interim core dividend of 0.95p per share. The Board expects to pay another substantial dividend in respect to FY '22. The policy for such dividends is based on distributing all funds above the cash flow for GBP 100 million at each financial year-end, subject to a positive cash outlook and any residual working capital buffer. The group remains highly cash generative, with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, including the payments of GBP 374 million of dividends in respect to financial years 2017 to 2019.\nThis slide updates our progress in the actions we announced in August to further streamline our business and drive material annual cost savings in the future. We've made good progress in each of our cost-saving initiatives, which, as a reminder, ultimately reached GBP 30 million of annual savings versus pre-pandemic levels. Split evenly across, firstly, property by reducing our footprint and its cost. And in the first half, property costs have decreased by GBP 1.2 million, so a good progress to date. Second, back-office efficiencies through increased use of automation and existing lower-cost shared service centers. The group projects, led by James Hilton, are fully mobilized. Detailed plans will be signed off by June 2022, with the implementation of projects starting in FY '23, to be completed by the end of FY '25.\nAnd finally, travel, as better use of video technology become permanent and as we deliver on absolute travel reduction targets to support our net 0 journey, such as reducing flights by 40% versus pre-pandemic levels. To date, we've held on to GBP 15 million of annual savings versus pre-pandemic cost base. So we're gaining good progress to date.\nAnd on cash, as anticipated, we saw a modest normalization in client payment terms during the half, which meant debtor days increased to 35 days versus 34 days in the first half last year and 33 days at year-end. We continue to expect a long-term cash benefit from sustainably lower debtor days of circa GBP 45 million versus pre-pandemic level. This will, of course, lead to greater cash returns to shareholders.\nSo in summary, in the first half, we delivered record fees with excellent profit growth. Activity levels remained strong in all of our major markets, driven by high client and candidate confidence. Encouragingly, on the back of clear wage inflation, we're driving improvements in our margins via more robust pricing, with increases in our temp margin and average perm fee. Our profit performance in the half was also strong as we balanced driving a good drop-through rate of incremental fees into profits of 49%, with adding 1,000 consultants to position ourselves for future growth and to capitalize on the cyclical recovery and long-term structural growth opportunities.\nConsultant productivity was excellent, and we expect to drive this further in FY '23. All of this further strengthened our financial position. And the Board expects to announce a substantial special dividend in respect of FY '22 at our prelim results in August.\nComing on to current trading. Trading across all of our markets is strong, and our new year return to work has been good overall. Momentum is strong in Perm, with activity exceeding pre-Christmas levels by the end of January. In Temp, our overall new year return to work was initially one week slower than in prior years, particularly in Australia, with temps taking additional vacations and modestly higher average sickness levels related to the Omicron variant. Encouragingly, overall temp volumes have returned to pre-Christmas levels by early February, in line with normal trends.\nConsistent with prior years, due to the timing of public holidays, there are 6 fewer working days in our second half versus the first half. This has no impact on year-on-year growth comparative. But we'll clearly act to the headwind on sequential profit growth versus the first half, particularly in our Temp and contracting business. Currency movements are likely to have a larger negative impact as group profits increased in FY '22. Finally, we've again upgraded our FY '22 profit expectations, with FY '22 now expected to be between GBP 210 million and GBP 215 million.\nAnd with that, I'll hand you back to Alistair, who will update you on strategy before we take your questions.\n\nAlistair Richard Cox\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Hays plc\n\nThank you, Paul.\nWe usually use the strategy section to highlight the key structural drivers which are shaping our future plans. However, given that we've got our Investor Day on the 28th of April, which is the first one that we've held since 2017, I think it's better to save the deep dive into what's going on in our markets until then.\nSuffice to say though, I personally have never seen such a wide range of profound changes in the world of work as what we're seeing today. And those are throwing up some really interesting opportunities for us. And a lot of our forward thinking is designed to capitalize on what's going on.\nYou can see here some of the themes as clients struggle to find the talent and what that might mean on wages, on working styles, workforce demographics, training and skill levels, for example.\nWage inflation and job churn are obvious positives for us. But as organizations also look at the type of workforce that they need, where they're located, how they work and how they develop the skills that they need, there are opportunities for us to make ourselves ever more relevant and more embedded in our clients to help solve those problems. So I hope you can join us in April to hear all of that. And today, I'll focus on how we're going in our SGI program.\nI said back in August that we're following 2 simultaneous investment paths. The first capitalizes on the strong cyclical recovery across the world. And as we've said, we added over 1,700 new consultants in the last year. 1,250 of whom are in what you could call business as usual investment to just meet the unprecedented levels of demand that we're seeing. That's obviously a much greater level of general investment than we've ever done before, but it's clearly paying off.\nThe second investment path is SGI. And this is designed to reposition our business to make sure that we are the leader in those areas that we think will be the most attractive and important in the future and to do this quickly.\nRemember, the genesis of this program was back in May 2020 when we asked ourselves 3 questions. Firstly, what services the world will need once the pandemic has passed? Secondly, how will it want those services delivered? And then thirdly, how can we best position ourselves as global market leaders in those areas? And I'm very pleased with what we're delivering on this already, and all our chosen areas are hitting their targets.\nWe invested GBP 15 million in 20 projects last year, adding 250 consultants. That early success meant that we raised our ambitions this year. And in the first half, we added another 300 heads in over 35 projects at a cost of GBP 8 million in the half. We'll add a further 100 more consultants in SGI projects in our second half, taking cumulative FY '21 and FY '22 SGI additions to 650. That's 50 more than we expected in August. Encouragingly though, FY '22 SGI fees are now running slightly ahead of plan, meaning that our full year net investment target remains at the GBP 20 million we stated earlier.\nExamples of what this means practically are the establishment of new teams in the engineering, civils and sustainability sectors in the U.K., which are all now up and running under dedicated leadership. In the States, we've doubled down both cyber and Life Sciences, with the additional capacity and leadership that we added equivalent to the size of a small acquisition, but obviously without the attached risk. We've invested in our Asian enterprise account business to win more and bigger deals. And in Germany and the U.K., we're ramping up quickly our project services business, which opens up a whole new spend category in our clients.\nHowever, the largest element of SGI is in technology recruitment globally. Well over half of our SGI heads in the first half were fee earners in the tech space. And our investment from last year is a large part of why our technology fees are now at record levels, up 35% in the half, including our second quarter fees, up over 20% versus pre-pandemic levels.\nToday, we're the global leader in technology recruitment, with the scale and geographic coverage that is probably unique in our world. However, we built that leadership over the last 10 years. And we delivered a 12% fee growth CAGR all the way up to the pandemic. However, our recent focus has accelerated that to the 35% we just delivered in the first half.\nTo support our strategy, we launched Hays Technology as a global brand. And that has been super successful as we've seen engagement levels with our market increased dramatically in the last year. Our business is also far more diversified by geography and skill set. Fees in the Rest of the World division are more than 1/5 above pre-pandemic levels. And this division has doubled its relative scale and is now 35% of our global tech fees. The U.K. was already a big tech business, and yet it still increased by 50% in the half and is now 1/3 bigger than pre-pandemic. So if anyone thinks the U.K. has got no structural opportunities, then think again.\nAnd it's a similar story in ANZ. Germany has always been our largest tech business. And having grown 22%, it's now back above pre-pandemic levels on a monthly basis, and I expect it to continue to hit new records. So today, we've already grown our annualized tech fee run rate to around GBP 300 million, which is well on the way to the goal that we announced just back in August of GBP 500 million in the next 5 years. We'll set out our plans on how to get there at the Investor Day, but it's obviously from a range of different areas. We'll expand our services. We'll continue to enter new verticals and target different client types across all sectors.\nBut the advantage that we have to deliver on all of this is our existing global infrastructure, our management expertise, our brand, and the industry partnerships that we've built over many years. And those are all vital ingredients for our success as well as being very hard to replicate. However, the price to be the undisputed leader in global tech recruitment is absolutely enormous, and we're committed to getting there.\nSo in conclusion, I think it's been a very successful 6 months. We've delivered record fees. And we produced the fastest profit growth in our history. We've invested more than ever before to capitalize on that market recovery and in long-term structural opportunities. Our consultants today are operating at excellent productivity levels, but there's a lot more to come as our more recent joiners start to build higher fees. I think that there's a palpable sense of ambition and optimism around our business, and that gives me great confidence for the next chapter. And the route to exceeding pre-pandemic levels of profit by FY '23 is clear, but there's clearly lots to do to get there.\nAnd then finally, a word on our other news today, that Paul has decided to retire and will step down at the end of September, and that James Hilton is being promoted to Group Finance Director. Paul has made a massive contribution to our company over the last 16 years. And as you've heard, he leaves the business in the best possible shape and arguably with the greatest ever set of opportunities ahead. Paul has been a trusted and talented support to me throughout. And I wish him the very best in his well-earned retirement.\nSo also a testament to Paul's personal investment in the development of his team that we have in James, someone with all the skills, experience and insight, to now step up as our new CFO. James and I have worked together over many years now. And I very much look forward to continuing to work alongside him in his new role.\nWe'd now be delighted to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSVP of IR, Hasbro, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's incoming Chief Executive Officer; Rich Stoddart, Hasbro's Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris, Rich and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance, then we will take your questions. Eric Nyman, Hasbro's incoming President and Chief Operating Officer, will be joining us for Q&A.\nOur earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.\nI would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?\n\nChris Cocks\n\nPresident & COO, Wizards of the Coast LLC\n\nThanks, Debbie, and welcome, everyone, joining today. I'm thrilled to be starting as Hasbro's CEO later this month and overwhelmed by the outpouring of well wishes from employees, partners and stakeholders since the announcement. The positive response is a testament to this amazing company and the wonderful people, brands and fan communities around the world that make it so special.\nHasbro is unique in our ability to create cherished childhood memories that translate into lifelong favorites. Our brands stand toys that inspire wonder to collectibles that showcase fashion, board games that bring families together to gaming systems with thriving global fandoms and animation that delights children to feature films and video games that engage audiences of all ages. As CEO, I'll be working with our team focused on 3 long-term priorities.\nFirst and foremost is driving growth with the Brand Blueprint. At the heart of Hasbro is the Brand Blueprint. It enables us to expand the value of our brands and capabilities as we engage our fans across all aspects of play and entertainment from consumer products to games to streaming TV shows, executing through our owned and operated assets and the best partners in the industry. We've seen significant success with this strategy with brands as varied as PEPPA PIG; TRANSFORMERS; and most recently, MY LITTLE PONY. And I'm excited as we extended benefits to more brands from PLAY-DOH to MAGIC: THE GATHERING, to our upcoming blockbuster movie and AAA video games with DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.\nOur next focus area will be multigenerational fan engagement. Play isn't just our kids anymore. It's a lifeline pursuit. Gen Z's favorite brands are the ones they play with that surround them with engaging experiences, and millennials and Gen X aren't far off. We are creating omnimedia play and entertainment that spans age ranges, connect people together and is passed along generation to generation; lastly, new growth opportunities, specifically games and direct. At $2.1 billion and 19% year-over-year growth, Hasbro is one of the biggest and fastest-growing games publishers in the world. Our investments in digital and direct-to-consumer give us an amazing opportunity to forge tighter relationships with our most valued customers to learn from them in real time via cutting-edge data analytics and to reinvent how we bring product to market and customize it for our most passionate fans. While the whole Blueprint generates immense value for Hasbro, look for us with particular focus on these fast-growing businesses as we take our portfolio to the next level.\nUnderlying these priorities will be a laser focus on capital allocation, how we invest in the business, prioritize our brands and drive total shareholder return while paying down debt, maintaining an investment-grade rating and returning cash to shareholders. We'll be sharing more insights about how we will drive our Blueprint strategy, extend our fan engagements and grow our gaming and direct-to-consumer assets in the quarters to come, underpinned by a strong sense of purpose and commitment to our planet and people.\nIn the meantime, my focus will be squarely on partnering with Deb, Darren, Cynthia and Eric on executing with excellence to deliver our growth plans as well as meeting with the stakeholders who help make Hasbro, Hasbro. I want to end with a special thank you to Rich Stoddart. Rich came on board 5 months ago after the tragic loss of Brian Goldner, our beloved leader of nearly 15 years. Using uncommon care, a natural insight from this time serving on our Board and strong and steady leadership, he helped guide us to exceptional results. Rich, your insights and leadership will be amazing assets as the new Chair of our Board of Directors, and I'm looking forward to working with and learning from you as we grow Hasbro in the years to come.\n\nRichard S. Stoddart\n\nInterim CEO & Independent Director, Hasbro, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. The global Hasbro team finished the year strong, delivering full year results above our guidance, including 17% revenue growth, a 40 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin, 23% growth to $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $800 million in operating cash flow. Deb and I are very proud of the Hasbro team and all they accomplished in the past several months.\nThroughout the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, we successfully navigated supply chain challenges across the business, delivering another record Wizards of the Coast, growing consumer products revenue for the year and fourth quarter and achieving robust content deliveries above 2019 levels in our Entertainment business. The Brand Blueprint strategy is driving profitable growth across our diversified portfolio, and Hasbro's unique set of strategic assets provide the foundation for maximizing the value of both our existing franchises and new IP. We have and are investing significant capital around the Blueprint, expanding and growing our powerful gaming portfolio, including in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, building deeper and more valuable brands, telling compelling stories to global audiences and in developing our talented teams. Our commitment to disciplined strategic investments over the long term has built a differentiated business with diversified capabilities to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. This is evident in our performance the last year.\nFirst, gaming. With a portfolio of $2.1 billion that grew 19%, Hasbro's gaming portfolio is among the biggest, most profitable and fastest-growing combinations of gaming brands across face-to-face, tabletop and digital platforms in the world. It's led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and 2021 was MAGIC's best year ever. Over the past 5 years, we've invested close to $1 billion to drive 150% growth in high-margin revenue and position us for growth in the coming years across tabletop and digital gaming. These investments are meaningfully expanding our tabletop products and creating best-in-class digital game capabilities, while recruiting and retaining world-class talent.\nWe are very excited to have Cynthia Williams joining us later this month from Microsoft as President of Wizards of the Coast in Digital Gaming to lead this team as Chris transitions to CEO of Hasbro. Chris orchestrated a tremendous period of growth and expansion for Wizards and has invested to position the business and team for continued success.\nThe consistent growth of MAGIC is a testament to the long-term durability of our strategy, led by doubling down on collectibility, expanding the MAGIC product suite to maximize relevance across consumer segments and giving players exciting and compelling worlds to participate in.\nIn digital, MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena's launch on mobile has been impressive, generating significant growth with continued high engagement from our players of around 9 hours per week. The launch of mobile more than doubled our prelaunch monthly average users at its peak and has since settled into a sustained 50% increase in our average monthly active users, as mobile has become a key way for our fans to access their favorite strategy gain.\nWe have only begun to unlock the value of the digital gaming potential of the Wizards brands and capabilities of the team. In 2021, digital gaming revenue, including the high-margin license digital gaming business, grew 36% and represented 26% of the segment. Tabletop gaming revenue represents the largest piece of the segment at 74% of the total and grew 44% for the year. We have significant plans to leverage the power of Wizards' brands across the Blueprint for both current fans and to expand our reach to new players and fans. This begins with MAGIC: THE GATHERING Netflix series coming later this year; and in 2023, the planned theatrical release of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS feature film.\nFurthermore, these upcoming releases will harness the full potential of our brand blueprint. With a comprehensive sales and marketing plan across our organization, including special edition tabletop and card set releases, digital games, a robust Hasbro toy line and expansive licensed consumer products. Our many years of investment in these brands and in building assets to drive growth around the blueprint position us to leverage them in bigger and more powerful ways for years to come.\nLast year also marked the successful relaunch of another iconic Hasbro franchise brand. Led by the expertise of the eOne team, MY LITTLE PONY and New Generation drove the MY LITTLE PONY brand through the animated feature film that was #1 in the Netflix Kid's top 10 in more than 80 countries on opening weekend, driving high viewership and audience engagement. The film fueled greater-than-100% growth in toy and game point of sale in the fourth quarter versus last year and double-digit growth in licensed consumer products for the year. With a significant multiyear content road map led by eOne and a deep and innovative merchandise program, we believe MY LITTLE PONY is positioned to reclaim its place as a leading global lifestyle brand through expansive blueprint activation.\nPEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS are further examples of valuable brands for which the combination of Hasbro and eOne is accelerating the growth and opportunity. In August, we launched the first Hasbro toys and games for these leading preschool brands. We had a very strong first few quarters in the market and have gained share in preschool toys. PEPPA PIG was one of our top brand growers last year. And as we shifted licensed revenue to in-sourced revenue in toys and games, the team was still able to grow licensed consumer products revenue double digits, highlighting the powerful reach of PEPPA PIG across categories.\nIn recognition of the relevance and success of the brand, combined with the opportunity ahead, we have elevated PEPPA PIG to a franchise brand, and we'll begin reporting this with our first quarter earnings. It is a clear indication of the potential value of this brand we acquired with eOne.\nAs we think about powerful brands, our Partner Brand portfolio is activating some of the most valuable entertainment brands in the industry. We grew Partner Brand revenue (inaudible) last year with significant growth in Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio, led by the Spider-Man franchise, including products in support of the feature film, Spider-Man: No Way Home and the animated new show Spidey and His Amazing Friends.\nWe also grew revenue for Hasbro's line of Star Wars products, despite a strong fourth quarter last year with season 2 of the Mandalorian. We recently announced an extension of our Star Wars license and are excited to have added the Indiana Jones franchise with product in the market next year, supporting the theatrical release. Hasbro is proud to maintain a strong connection with the Walt Disney Company, the creator of some of the most celebrated and everlasting entertainment franchises and looks forward to continuing its storage relationship with new product lines for Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Marvel, including Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Spider-Man in the future.\nIn addition, we have exciting initiatives with new and expanding partners as diverse as Fortnite to roadblocks, and we see a bright future for our Partner Brand portfolio with higher profit growth in the mid- to long term.\nFinally, while I've highlighted several entertainment successes that are driving brands today and in the future, the Entertainment segment had a very successful year, delivering revenues above 2019 levels when adjusted for the music business, which we divested during 2021, with amazing shows like Yellowjackets, Cruel Summer, Gray Maile and The Rookie and the return of film deliveries, including Clifford the Big Red Dog and Finch, the eOne team delivered compelling content across platforms.\nImportantly, eOne has been focused on developing a strong pipeline of content or Hasbro brands, and we've seen an incredible response from the market. In 2021, we started to see that pipeline converted into green lights, production and releases to be activated across the brand blueprint.\nIn closing, it has been a true honor to work with the Hasbro team as interim CEO over these past several months. The entire Hasbro family has my deep gratitude for their tremendous focus on delivering at a high level. I especially want to thank Deb Thomas for her strong and steady leadership during such an important time. This year's results position Hasbro for continued growth and to continue driving shareholder value. With consumers, brands and storytelling at the center and purpose at our core, we have made and are making significant investments across the business and in our people to drive capabilities, insights and innovation to support our long-term growth. I am excited to see Chris and Eric take on their new roles later this month and confident that Hasbro will thrive under their leadership. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?\n\nDeborah M. Thomas\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hasbro, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. As Rich said, we're incredibly proud of the performance by the Hasbro team over the past several months to turn in an outstanding year. This includes full year double-digit growth in revenue, operating profit, earnings and adjusted EBITDA. We grew revenue across segments, brand portfolio and geographies. Wizards in digital gaming had its best year ever, doubling the size of the Wizards business 2 years earlier than anticipated. We furthered the integration of eOne, launching new increasingly Hasbro brand-led content campaigns as well as Hasbro's line for PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS. We remain on track to achieve the $130 million run rate of cost and in-sourcing synergies by the end of this year.\nWe strengthened our balance sheet, paying down over $1 billion in debt, ending the year with over $1 billion in cash. And after reducing our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA last year by 1.7x to 3.1, we are on track to hit our target of 2 to 2.5x by year-end 2023. And we invested across Hasbro to profitably grow for the long term while returning cash to shareholders, including a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend announced today and effective with our next dividend payment in May.\nOur 2021 results and current year outlook support our view to growth and value creation over the coming years. For the year, revenue grew 17% year-over-year and 8% versus pro forma 2019. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF, PEPPA PIG, MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS and Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio led the year-over-year growth, along with the return of Entertainment production and deliveries, notably in TV, streaming and animation. The Wizards of the Coast in digital gaming segment had a phenomenal year, growing revenue, 42%; operating profit, 30%; ending the year with an operating profit margin of 42.5%, and adjusted EBITDA was higher by 36%.\nWe have success in both tabletop and digital gaming, led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. We have significantly invested to drive these brands for current and future growth.\nConsumer Products segment revenues grew 9% year-over-year. Robust demand for Hasbro products, strategic pricing actions and significantly improved execution in markets like Latin America and Asia drove a 170 basis point operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the higher freight and input costs as well as supply chain challenges incurred during the year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 18%.\nThe team managed supply and delivered strong revenue growth, but our product in stock levels were lower than target. Part of this was due to demand above our plan, in part due to continuing supply chain disruption. To help us maintain Consumer Products segment operating profit margins at or above 2021 levels, we have price increases scheduled to take effect in the second quarter to offset the anticipated continuation of supply chain challenges and resulting higher input and freight costs.\nEntertainment segment revenue increased 27% for the year, exceeding 2019 pro forma levels of revenue when adjusted for the sale of the music business. Adjusted operating profit grew 13%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 76% for the full year 2021. Adjusted operating profit increased due to higher revenue and lower administrative costs, partially offset by higher program cost amortization associated with more deliveries, the mix of content and higher overall costs related to COVID.\nOverall, adjusted operating profit grew 20% and operating profit margin expanded on a favorable mix of revenues, strategic pricing, which partially offset higher costs at the same time, investing in product innovation and advertising behind brands and entertainment. On a reported basis, other income expense net included a $54 million pretax noncash, nonoperating charge associated with our investment in the Discovery Family Channel. The pandemic has accelerated changes in the cable distribution industry, and networks have seen a decline in linear subscribers.\nDuring the over 10-year life of our investment, we've recorded more than $1.1 billion of merchandise revenue related to Hasbro programming on the channel, averaging more than $100 million per year. Since reducing our ownership from 50% to 40% in 2014, we've recorded approximately $130 million of nonoperating investment income or an $18.5 million annual average. This investment has delivered a strong return for Hasbro.\nTurning to tax. The full year underlying tax rate, absent non-GAAP charges and discrete items, was 21.3%. The lower adjusted rate of 15.8% was the result of favorable discrete items from audit settlements, synergies from the integration of eOne and tax planning. For 2022, our underlying rate, absent non-GAAP charges and discrete items, is expected to decline to approximately 20.5%, with an adjusted rate expected in the 18% to 20% range as we do not predict the same level of favorable discrete items we had in 2021.\nAs I said to start, our balance sheet is strong. Accounts receivable increased 8% versus 17% revenue growth as collections remain strong. After declining 17 days last year, DSO declined another 6 days to 68 days with improvement across Hasbro, led by our Entertainment business and international commercial markets.\nThe inventory we had at year-end is of very high quality. Our aged inventory is well below historical levels, but the levels we have on hand and at retail are higher than last year. For both owned and retail inventory, this reflects a significant increase in the amount of inventory in transit as lead times from China have increased about 3x on average. Hasbro owned inventory also reflects higher fleet and product costs. These higher capitalized costs are expected to have a negative impact on gross margin in the first quarter prior to price increases taking effect.\nFor 2021, we reported an adjusted EPS of $5.23 per share. As you think about 2022 EPS, I want to walk through several items. First, as a reminder, in the first quarter of 2021, we realized a nonoperating gain of $25.6 million from a legal settlement. This translated to $0.18 per share in Q1 2021, and this will not have a comp in the current year.\nSecond, we sold the eOne music business in Q3 of last year. This represented $65.2 million in revenue and $16.9 million in adjusted operating profit during the first half of 2021, which would equate to approximately $0.08 per share on the full year.\nFinally, following Brian's passing, there was an accelerated contractual vesting of certain equity awards in the fourth quarter. Diluted share count is expected to increase from 138.4 million for the full year 2021 to approximately 141 million for full year 2022 on a weighted average basis.\nAs we look ahead, we're investing today to build bigger, more powerful brands around the Brand Blueprint. These investments are in innovation, in capabilities, in storytelling and in our people.\nComing off a year of double-digit revenue and operating profit growth, for 2022, we expect revenue and adjusted operating profit to grow in the low single digits and deliver operating profit margin expansion as well as operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in line with the $1.3 billion achieved in 2021.\nLooking at our segments in 2022, we expect the Wizards in digital gaming segment to grow in the mid-single digits. We continue to invest to grow this high-return business over the near and the long term. Over the medium term, as we expect to see acceleration beginning in 2023, we're targeting compound annual revenue growth in the high single to low double digits and operating margins to remain above 40%. The toy and game industry has grown at an above-trend growth rate the past 2 years, and we expect that to slow or decline in the coming year, but we are well positioned with new initiatives and great content.\nWe believe we can continue to grow the Consumer Products segment through innovative brand campaigns, including a full year of PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS, continued growth in MY LITTLE PONY as we accelerate around the blueprint through a strategic and well-placed content road map from eOne supporting merchandise plans and new entertainment for key partner brands like Marvel and Star Wars. While our rights expire for Disney Princess and Frozen at the end of 2022, we are very excited about our continuing relationships with Disney for Marvel, Star Wars and Indiana Jones and the product offerings around these brands.\nThe Disney Princess and Frozen business has averaged approximately $250 million in revenue per year for Hasbro, peaking in 2019 with the last Frozen film. We expect to grow our Consumer Products segment revenue in the low single digits in 2022 as we execute the rich and valuable portfolio of Hasbro and Partner Brands and increasing to a mid-single-digit growth rate over the medium term, including greater operating profit margin expansion in 2023 and beyond.\nIn the Entertainment segment, with high demand for content as well as theatrical improving, the entertainment industry is expected to continue growing. Combined with our robust entertainment slate, we anticipate 2022 growth in the Entertainment segment in the mid-single digits, absent the music business, which was sold in 2021. As we activate more Hasbro-branded content, we expect revenue to grow in the high single to low double digits over the medium term with higher growth in operating profit and adjusted EBITDA to drive margin expansion. Our cash spend on content for this year is expected in the range of $725 million to $825 million to support content development and deliveries over a multiyear period. Notably, we're planning significant initiatives executed across the Brand Blueprint in Consumer Products, gaming and Entertainment, including feature films for Transformers: Rise of the Beast and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS that are expected to accelerate revenue and operating profit growth in 2023.\nFor the medium term through 2024, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a compounding annual basis. Each segment has strength on its own. But as we have seen over time, the greatest return comes from the broad portfolio that is part of our Brand Blueprint strategy delivers greater value. Importantly, we expect the financial benefits of our combined capabilities to grow over time. By year-end 2023, operating profit margin is expected to exceed 16% and operating cash flow should reach approximately $1 billion.\nIn closing, long-term investments in our brands and capabilities have built a differentiated business with diversified capabilities to drive long-term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. These investments have benefited not only 2021, but are designed to benefit years to come. After delivering a high-quality year, we're positioned for further growth in 2022 and on track for greater revenue growth and greater operating profit expansion in 2023 and beyond as we leverage our investments and building brands and capabilities across the Brand Blueprint to drive profitable growth for the long term under a strong leadership team."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us at short notice for this rearranged call. I'll present the highlights and key themes of today's update and discuss regional performances before taking questions. As usual, all net fee (inaudible) percentages are on a like-for-like basis versus prior year unless stated otherwise.\nPerformance overview. In Q2, we delivered record quarterly fees up 37%, which is ahead of market expectations with excellent growth in all regions. And within that, November delivered an all-time fee record. Currency translation had a significant negative impact, decreasing headline net fees by 5%, and there were no material working day adjustments in the period.\nI highlight the following key features of the results. One, we delivered quarterly record in 16 countries, including the strategically important markets of the U.S. and China. And in Germany, our largest business, we delivered record contracting fees.

Six, our net fee exit rate in December was 34% despite a tougher growth comparative. Seven, cash performance was good, and we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with net cash of GBP 235 million, in line with our expectations. And of course, this is after having made dividend payments of GBP 170 million in November.

New Zealand, which is [8%] of ANZ fees, delivered a few record and increased by an excellent 56%. Consultant headcount in ANZ at increased by 3% in the quarter and 29% year-on-year.\nGermany. Germany, our largest business representing 25% of group fees, grew by 37%, with activity improving through the quarter and fees growing sequentially versus Q1 FY '22. November produced a monthly fee record. Overall business confidence continues to improve with clients increasingly investing in new and expanding existing projects. Contracting 57% of German fees delivered a record quarter. Fees grew by 22%, driven by 27% growth in contractor volumes with average contractor volumes now 11% above prior peak levels. This was partially offset by 5% lower average weekly hours per contractor. -- camp, which is mainly in engineering and manufacturing continued to recover at 68% or 51%, excluding the effects of severance costs in FY '21.\nVolumes improved through the quarter, although given slow recovery in the automotive and manufacturing sector still remain 18% below pre-pandemic levels. (inaudible) delivered an excellent performance, up and consult headcount increased by 5% in the quarter and 12% year-on-year. United Kingdom and Ireland. The U.K. and Ireland division, 23% of group fees increased by 33%, with sequential growth versus Q1 FY '22, there by an excellent Perm performance of 69% and Temp up [13%]. Private sector fees increased by 46% with the public sector up 12%.\nMost regions traded broadly in line with the overall business, except the East of England and Scotland, which grew by 44% and 39%, respectively. Our largest U.K. region of London grew by 34%, including London City, which is predominantly private sector focused up an excellent 68%.

Consult head count was up 7% in the quarter and 35% year-on-year.\nCash flow and balance sheet. Cash collection was good. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with net cash of GBP 235 million, in line with our expectations after paying GBP 170 million in dividends in November. Current trading and guidance. As usual, our new year return to work trends will be a key driver of second half performance. It's too early to quantify how the Omicron variant will impact trading. [Two] after significant investment in consultant headcount over the last 12 months, we expect investment to moderate to 4% over the next quarter with headcount growth mainly in Germany and on our strategic growth initiatives, which continue to perform very well. Consultant productivity remains very high and close to record levels, and we expect to increase from (inaudible) positivity further with productivity of our newer consultant ramps up in the coming quarters.\nThrough the strength in the sterling versus the euro and Australian dollar represents a headwind to [FY '22] operating profit. If we retranslate FY '21 operating profit of GBP 95 million, 11th of January 2022 exchange rates, operating profit will decline by GBP 7 million, a GBP 2 million deterioration versus our position at Q1 FY '22 trading update in October. Importantly, as group operating profit will clearly increase materially in FY '22, currency will have a much larger negative impact this year. And four, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of our strong fee performance, FY '22 operating profit is expected to be circa GBP 2 million. And whilst the Omicron variant creates some further uncertainties, recruitment markets are very strong and (inaudible) client confidence remains at high levels. There are clear and increasing signs of significant skill shortage in wage inflation, particularly at the higher salary levels.\nOur focus for the second half will be on delivering substantial profit growth whilst continuing to invest in the future. As global economies continue to rebound, I'm confident we'll continue to put further market share as we invest in the cyclical recovery and take advantage of the many structural growth opportunities. We are firmly focused on positioning Hays as the clear market leader in the most attractive long-term sectors and geographies, including technology and Germany. We look forward to providing a more detailed update of our strategy at our Investor Day on Thursday, the 28th of April. I'll now hand you back to the administrator, and we're happy to take your questions."

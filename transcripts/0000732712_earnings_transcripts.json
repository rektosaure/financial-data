[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm Brady Connor, and on the call with me this morning is our new Chief Executive Officer, Dan Schulman; and Tony Skiadas, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to point you to our safe harbor statement, which can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. Our comments this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our SEC filings. This presentation also contains non-GAAP financial measures, and you can find reconciliations of these measures in the materials on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel H. Schulman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brady, and good morning, everyone.\nOn behalf of the Board and everyone at the company, I want to start off by thanking Hans for his leadership and passion and his many contributions to Verizon over the past 8 years.\nHans executed a series of technology-related investments that have positioned Verizon for success. By building an enviable network and a strong foundation we can leverage going forward. Hans been a friend for many years, and I appreciate your support as we enter this new chapter. Personally, I could not be more excited about the future of Verizon, and I am honored to be its next CEO.\nAs most of you know, I come to this role with extensive experience in the technology telecommunications and wireless industries. In fact, I began my career as an assistant account executive at New Jersey Bell and then spent 18 years at AT&T eventually becoming the President of its consumer division. So I have deep roots in the telecom sector and in many ways, this is like coming home for me. In the years since I've had the privilege to help lead and grow some of the most iconic consumer brands in the world, including AT&T, priceline.com, Virgin Mobile, American Express, PayPal and now Verizon. Those experiences have provided me with a strong perspective on customer-centric growth. And of course, I've served on the Board of Verizon for the past 7 years. So while I am only a few weeks into my tenure as the company's CEO, I've had a front row seat into the company's evolution since 2018 and therefore, come into this role with a rich perspective of where Verizon is coming from and what the opportunities are. For many years, Verizon has led the industry with our reliable and scalable network, and we will continue to advance our network leadership. As you know, we're significantly investing in cyber and in the power of convergence with our acquisition of Frontier, which we expect to close early next year. Verizon has deep strength and incredible potential, but the blunt truth is we haven't captured the customer growth opportunities, this strong foundation enables. Verizon is at a critical inflection point. For years, our priority was clear: build the best and most reliable network.\nWith that foundation firmly in place, our next chapter is about serving and delighting customers by building the industry's best overall value proposition and the best customer experience on top of it. we must shift to a customer-first focus and redefine our trajectory. This is not a course correction. It is a fundamental change in our strategic approach to customers. The only way we can drive sustainable value for our shareholders is by significantly raising our game and winning responsibly in the market. This is about financially disciplined growth, winning with the right customers at the right economics. Volume growth and profitability growth can go and will go hand-in-hand. We are fully committed to achieving both simultaneously.\nBefore I elaborate on my vision for a revitalized Verizon, I'm going to hand it over to Tony to cover our third quarter performance.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan, and good morning.\nBefore I begin, I just want to take a moment to congratulate Dan on his appointment as CEO of Verizon. The leadership team and I are excited to work with him in creating this new chapter for our company. First and foremost, we remain on track to deliver our full year financial guidance, which includes our previously raised expectations for adjusted EBITDA growth adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow.\nIn Consumer Mobility, we delivered strong postpaid phone gross adds up 8.4% from the prior year. However, gross add growth was offset by churn of 91%, which resulted in postpaid phone net losses of 7,000 in the quarter. We continue to see healthy retention benefits from our converged customers. At the end of the quarter, more than 18% of our consumer postpaid phone base took a converged offering more than 200 basis points above last year. We see significant opportunities to increase convergence in the Frontier footprint after we close the transaction. Importantly, converged customers on fiber have a mobility churn rate that's nearly 40% lower than our overall mobility base. We also saw a 16% year-over-year increase in consumer upgrades in the third quarter tied to our best value guarantee, which is resonating with customers.\nMoving to core prepaid, we delivered 47,000 net adds, our fifth consecutive quarter of positive subscriber growth. The strength of our key brands as well as the continued expansion of total wireless distribution positions us to continue to grow our prepaid business. Verizon business delivered 51,000 phone net adds. As expected, we continue to see disconnect pressure in the public sector, in part from ongoing government efficiency efforts. This was more than offset by strong demand from small and medium businesses and large enterprise customers as we continue to be the provider of choice for businesses.\nShifting to broadband. We once again delivered solid results with 306,000 net adds. Our broadband base is up 1.3 million subscribers from a year ago and is now over 13.2 million subscribers. Fios Internet delivered 61,000 net adds, our best quarterly result in 2 years. Given the demand for Fios, we're working to bring it to more and more premises within our footprint.\nIn addition, we recently announced an initiative with Tillman that will enable us to bring our best-in-class files broadband offerings to even more households and businesses. The agreement combines Tillman's network design build and operations capabilities with Verizon scale, distribution strength and brand power. We will focus on markets outside of the Verizon and Frontier footprint, expanding our Fios business to new places across the country and driving more convergence in these markets.\nFixed Wireless Access net adds were 261,000 for the quarter. With approximately 5.4 million FWA subscribers, our annualized revenue has surpassed $3 billion and continues to grow. We believe FWA can be a long-term sustainable business. In addition, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Starry, which will enhance our MDU capabilities, combining our scale and resources with Starry's technical and go-to-market expertise.\nMoving to financials. Our third quarter performance keeps us on track to deliver on our financial guidance for the year. Third quarter consolidated revenue was $33.8 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year period. We delivered over $400 million of year-over-year wireless service revenue growth in the quarter. Wireless equipment revenue was 5.2% higher than the prior year, driven by higher gross adds and upgrade rates. Wireless service revenue was up 2.1% from the prior year, driven by continued ARPU growth from targeted pricing actions and further adoption of fixed wireless access and add-on services. Perks continued to provide a high-margin revenue stream, and we look forward to offering additional benefits for our customers. Additionally, prepaid revenue grew year-over-year for the first time since the TracFone acquisition. As expected, we faced the promo amortization headwind in the quarter, and we expect this headwind to continue. However, our underlying customer economics remain healthy.\nOn the expense side, we have work to do to further reduce our cost of services and SG&A. As Dan will outline, we will be looking at cost with the new lens and will be focused on driving significant cost savings across all aspects of our business. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $12.8 billion, up 2.3% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we have generated almost $1.3 billion more in adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024, driven by a combination of pricing actions and cost reduction. Our adjusted EBITDA growth of 3.5% through the end of the third quarter is at the top end of our guided range. Adjusted EPS was $1.21 in the quarter, up 1.7% year-over-year, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nThe cash generation of the business continues to be strong. Cash flow from operating activities was $28 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up over $1.5 billion or 5.8% and compared to the same period a year ago. CapEx through the end of the third quarter totaled $12.3 billion compared to $12 billion in the prior year period. We're on track to meet all of our investment goals for the year and deliver within our guided range or better. The combination of our continued CapEx efficiency and our ability to drive profits to the bottom line resulted in third quarter free cash flow of $7 billion. This represents a nearly 17% improvement year-over-year and the highest reported in our industry by nearly $2 billion for the period. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we have generated $15.8 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 9% compared to the same period a year ago. In September, we raised the dividend for the 19th consecutive year reflecting our continued commitment to shareholder returns.\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $112 billion, a $9.4 billion improvement year-over-year. We continue to make meaningful reductions to our debt throughout the year, resulting in our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio dropping to 2.2x as of the end of the third quarter. This puts us inside of our target leverage ahead of schedule and before the Frontier closing. We're focused on generating strong cash flow and committed to paying down our debt. We also remain committed to our long-term net unsecured leverage target range of 2.0 to 2.25x. This is not going to change.\nLooking ahead, we remain on track to close the Frontier deal in the first quarter of 2026. We have received approvals from 11 of 13 states and are making good progress in the remaining jurisdictions. Integration planning is on track. And through the third quarter, based on their public disclosures, Frontier is performing extremely well across both their fiber build and customer growth. While we continue to execute within the parameters of our financial guidance, we recognize there is significant opportunity ahead.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel H. Schulman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tony.\nWhen I look at our performance objectively Verizon is clearly falling short of our potential. And as a result, we are not delivering the shareholder returns our investors expect. Despite investing significantly in network leadership. We have not been able to translate that into winning in the market. And consequently, we are not generating the financial profile necessary for share price appreciation. Our stock performance reflects this reality. My mandate from the Board is clear: unlock the growth potential of our platform while delivering strong financial results. Today, I intend to discuss my priorities and areas of focus. Our plan will not be about incremental change. We intend to aggressively transform the culture and financial profile of our company operating under the principles of being bold, customer-centric and executing with financial discipline with a focus on shareholder value. For the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not sustainable strategy. Every year, it gets harder to grow as we lap past price increases and experienced higher churn. This cannot continue, and there is no question that meaningful change is needed. As we shift to a customer-first culture, we will simultaneously drive a much more efficient cost structure, that fully supports our incremental investments in delighting our customers. I reject the premise that the lighting customers and winning in the market means that margins will decrease. I think this industry and clearly Verizon are only scratching the surface of increased bottom line performance.\nMy top strategic imperative for Verizon is to grow our customer base profitably across our mobility and broadband subscription businesses. I strongly believe that growing volumes essential to drive sustainable long-term revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We are going to compete and grow responsibly across all market segments. And over time, meaningfully increase our share of net adds, particularly in postpaid. We aim to win fairly by having the best overall value proposition and delighting our customers across all elements of the marketing mix. This is not going to be about promotional activities that can be quickly imitated. It is about true innovation, not easily replicated by our competitors. We will leverage our network excellence to drive growth, but we cannot rely on it exclusively.\nNetwork quality is now foundational. Winning in the marketplace demands a revamped and superior customer value proposition and requires full attention to the entire customer experience. We will significantly elevate our game across multiple dimensions. We will work relentlessly to serve our customers, ensuring that every customer is fully satisfied with their Verizon experience. We must make it much easier to do business with us. You should expect bold execution powered by sophisticated and smart marketing, actions that strengthen loyalty and the elimination of practices and processes that detract from the customer experience. Raising rates without corresponding value rarely, if ever, delights customers.\nOur primary objective is to build loyalty and drive significant improvements in retention to optimize the lifetime value of our customer base. Verizon will no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share. We are reinventing how we operate to make Verizon more agile and efficient. You should expect disciplined execution across marketing, operations and service. We will invest significantly across all elements of our marketing mix and customer experience to drive mobility and broadband growth, and we will fund these investments by aggressively reducing our entire cost base. We will be a simpler, leaner and scrappier business. This work is overdue and will be multi-year and an ongoing way of life for us.\nIn addition, as some of you know, I am a strong believer in the growing power resulting opportunities created by AI. We have barely scratched the surface of how AI-powered innovation can transform our customer experience. I intend to use AI as a key tool to simplify offers, improve the customer experience and reduce churn through smart consistent and more personalized marketing and offers. And we will leverage AI throughout the company to make it easier for our employees to delight our customers and to dramatically improve service of reducing cost and complexity across the vast majority of our business processes. While we narrow our focus to invest in key growth areas. We will also aggressively sunset or exit legacy businesses where we don't see a clear path, profitable market leadership. We have a large opportunity to unleash meaningful margin improvement by doing so. And we will talk about this in more detail in January.\nConvergence is one of our most significant near-term growth opportunities. The pending acquisition of Frontier will enable us to serve approximately 29 million fiber passings creating a massive cross-sell opportunity. Our wireless share significantly under-indexes in Frontier's territory, and we intend to address this on day 1. This will create a significant runway to capture mobility volume from our broadband customers and cross-sell broadband to our existing mobility base, driving meaningful revenue synergies. I recently met with the Frontier senior leadership team. Their focus and performance is impressive. The results are trending above the expectations when we signed the deal and I am looking forward to having them join the Verizon team. We will continue to expand our fiber footprint through our own build and with strategic partnerships. I expect the actions we are taking will enable us to generate higher free cash flow in 2026 and 2025, even when we include Frontier.\nOur business is generating strong cash flow today, but I believe it can be even stronger. I am committed to prioritizing the customer experience, while maximizing returns for our shareholders and doing both in a fiscally responsible manner. I am closely examining not just our operating expenses, but also our capital spend, and our capital allocation framework. I believe that elements within our framework can change to optimize our capital structure and shareholder returns. This includes an ironclad commitment to our dividend, continued debt repayment and value-creating capital return. In short, we will be much more deliberate in how we allocate our spend to execute our strategy. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the business. and we will do so with a critical eye towards growth areas. You can expect our capital envelope to support the completion of our C-band build-out and our long-term objectives for fiber expansion, while preserving our financial capacity and flexibility for strategic investments as the landscape evolves.\nTo summarize, we understand changes needed, and we are aggressively making those changes. Our goals and our priorities are clear. First, delighting our customers to meaningfully increase our share of industry net adds. Second, cost transformation, fundamentally restructuring our expense base. Third, capital efficiency, optimizing how and where we invest and fourth, accelerating shareholder returns by increasing our bottom line growth, and a steadfast commitment to our dividend. You can expect to see a tangible difference in the way of Verizon competes. Going forward, we will aggressively compete and fundamentally redefine what it means to be a Verizon customer. I'm confident in our strategy, our assets and the team's ability to execute. We have the network the scale, the brand and now the strategic clarity and commitment to drive sustainable growth.\nWe are planning to win, and this will be a different Verizon than the market is used to. This will not happen overnight, and there's no one silver bullet. It will require hard work, strategic focus and thoughtful execution. Importantly, much of the critical planning and evaluation is already well underway. We will provide 2026 guidance during our January earnings call. and we will report progress against these objectives quarterly. Our shareholders and our customers have been patient. It is now time for us to deliver.\nThank you, and Tony and I look forward to your questions and comments.",

    "content": "Q2 2025 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2025 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call\n\nVZNYSEJUL 21, 8:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning and welcome to Verizon's Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the call will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our Q2 2025 Earnings Call. I'm Brady Connor, and on the call with me this morning are Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Tony Skiadas, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found at the start of the investor presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results are contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nEarlier this morning, information on our Q2 results and supplemental materials relating to today's call were posted to our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our Earnings Call of the Q2 2025. Our performance in the first half of the year, highlighted by a strong Q2, demonstrates that our strategy is working. We remain committed to disciplined execution and customer-centric innovation. We have growing profitable connections and the value of our customer relationships. While we always see opportunities to improve, I'm confident in the future of our business. Our financial performance was strong this quarter, with a market-leading wireless service revenue of $20.9 billion, up 2.2% from last year. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year, setting another record for the best reported quarter and the second consecutive quarter with growth exceeding our guided range for the year. Strong profitability drove free cash flow of $5.2 billion for the quarter.\nThis brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $8.8 billion, an increase of over $300 million compared to first half of 2024. Our cash flow from operations underscores the strength of our business and provides us flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged. As a result, we continue to lead the industry with the nation's best network. Our segmented market strategy, which is a diverse portfolio of offerings, is resonating with our customers. Our customer-first offerings, such as My Plan, My Home, and the new My Biz Plan, along with our Best Value Guarantee, drove significant sales momentum. We're also deploying AI-powered innovations to enhance the customer experience on the nation's best network. On the infrastructure front, our execution is outpacing our targets. C-Band deployment is ahead of schedule.\nOur fixed wireless base has surpassed 5 billion subscribers, and our fiber build is tracking ahead of its plan. This demonstrates disciplined execution across our entire portfolio. Given our financial performance and the momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our full-year guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. We're also raising our guidance for Free Cash Flow for the year, driven by our strong cash flow from operations and further supported by the positive impact from the tax reform. Tony will provide you with more details shortly. Now, let's turn to our operational performance. In the Q2, we delivered over 300,000 net additions across our mobility and broadband platforms. In mobility, we delivered year-over-year improvements in the combined postpaid and core prepaid phone net adds, including the fourth consecutive quarter of subscriber growth in core prepaid.\nThe wireless market remains competitive, and we continue to take a strategic and segmented approach, maintaining our financial discipline. As expected, postpaid phone churn remained elevated this quarter, reflecting the lingering effects of our pricing actions and ongoing pressure from federal government accounts. We're actively focused on improving retention by strengthening our value propositions and leveraging our AI-powered customer experience innovations. On upgrades, after being down year-over-year for eight out of the last nine quarters, we saw an uptick in the Q2 driven by our Best Value Guarantee. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in upgrade activity for the full year. Our dual fixed wireless access and fiber broadband strategy continues to drive market share gains. A key highlight is fixed wireless access, which surpassed the 5 million subscribers milestone, keeping us firmly on the track to achieve our goal of 8 to 9 million subscribers by 2028.\nWe achieved robust broadband growth even as our C-Band build-out expands into less dense markets and despite a softer move environment in our Fios footprint. We continue to scale our private network business, winning a landmark deal to deploy multiple private fiber networks across the Thames Freeport. This network will serve as a technology foundation for one of the UK's busiest commercial corridors, fueling a multi-billion dollar regeneration project with advanced capabilities like AI and real-time logistics. Our AI Connect offerings are also generating strong interest. Our sales funnel has nearly doubled to $2 billion since launch earlier this year. While these are often complex deals with longer sales cycles, we're actively engaged in several sizable opportunities. This growth highlights a surging demand for high-bandwidth fiber capacity and diverse routes, both lit and dark fiber, to serve different customer needs.\nAs AI transitions from centralized training to widespread real-time application, compute power at the network edge becomes essential. Our existing infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support this evolution. Our network is our key differentiator, consistently delivering top performance. This quarter, J.D. Power once again recognized Verizon for the best network quality, and RootMetrics' first half 2025 awards named us the nation's best, fastest, and most reliable 5G network. We're building on this advantage every day. Our C-Band deployment is ahead of schedule and on track to cover 80% to 90% of planned sites by year-end, with nearly all sites now standalone capable. Our fiber build is tracking ahead of plan, and we're positioned to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year. Meanwhile, the regulatory approval process for our pending acquisition of Frontier is progressing as planned.\nWe're encouraged by Frontier's performance and look forward to closing the transaction to further accelerate our fiber expansion. As we near the closing of Frontier acquisition, we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, broadband expansion, and capital allocation considering all stakeholders. We look forward to providing an update in the next few months. With that, I turn it over to Tony to go into the financials in more detail.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning. The first half of the year reaffirms the strength of our business, highlighting the effective execution of our disciplined strategy and significant progress towards achieving our financial goals. As a leading provider of essential connectivity across the US, we are committed to offering the best value and delivering the best service and customer experience within the industry. We are focused on driving wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA growth, and robust Free Cash Flow. The Q2 demonstrated our ability to deliver strong financial results even in a period of elevated promotional activity and broad economic uncertainty. We remain focused on high-quality, profitable growth, recognizing that volume growth is only valuable when aligned with our disciplined financial framework. Our goal is to improve volume year-over-year, though we will not do this at the expense of delivering on our three key financial priorities.\nThis past quarter, we achieved strong sales focusing on high-quality customers without overspending for growth. Even with public sector challenges and ongoing consumer postpaid phone churn pressure, we maintained our financial discipline. Within consumer, Q2 postpaid phone gross additions were up sequentially and year-over-year. Our sales execution remained strong, leveraging our attractive value proposition, including the recent launch of the Best Value Guarantee. As expected, we saw the residual effects of our Q1 pricing actions impact our Q2 consumer postpaid phone churn. Additionally, we continue to see elevated competitor promotional activity. As a result, Q2 consumer postpaid phone churn remained consistent with the Q1 at about 90%. We have taken a series of actions to address our elevated churn. On 24 June, we launched initiatives designed to improve the customer experience, including leveraging AI for more personalized support.\nIn addition, we continue to enhance our value proposition and build customer loyalty through the Best Value Guarantee. We provide exclusive access to the best events and experiences, and our refresh app helps customers maximize the value of their plans. Mobility phone net adds, which includes both consumer and business retail postpaid, as well as core prepaid, were 16,000 for Q2. This represents an improvement of 25,000 from the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone net losses total 51,000 for Q2 compared to 109,000 net losses in the prior year period as we benefited from strong gross adds. Verizon Business delivered 42,000 phone net adds in Q2 compared with 135,000 net adds in the prior year period. A significant majority of the year-over-year decline was driven by the public sector business.\nThough we anticipate public sector pressures to persist in the second half of the year, we expect the impact to subside towards the end of the year. Consistent with our wireline approach, we continue to remain disciplined and not pursue low-margin wireless business or overpay for volumes. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment and deliver healthy volumes for the full year 2025. Core prepaid net additions were 50,000 for the quarter, an improvement of 62,000 from the prior year period. This marks four consecutive quarters of positive core prepaid net adds, reflecting the strong execution of the team. The Visible, Total Wireless, and Straight Talk brands continue to perform well and are progressively building a high-quality business.\nOverall, core prepaid ARPU rose above $32, and we have now reached an inflection point where, after four quarters of volume growth, we expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Turning to Total Wireless postpaid upgrades, we saw a 14% increase in the first half of the year as compared to the same period of 2024. This result was driven by a healthy initial uptake of our Best Value Guarantee program, which is an investment in our high-quality customer base. As Hans said earlier, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2025 as compared to 2024. Moving on to broadband, we delivered 293,000 net additions in the quarter.\nWe are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless access offerings, even with seasonal impacts and a softer move environment as compared to prior years. In fixed wireless access, we delivered 278,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 5.1 million subscribers. FWA demand remains strong, and we are on track to deliver our goal of 8 to 9 million FWA subscribers by 2028. Fios internet net adds for the Q2 were 32,000 versus 28,000 in the prior year period. Fios provides customers with industry-leading connectivity and delivers high customer satisfaction reflected in both robust ARPU and consistently low churn rates. We are expanding our Fios footprint and remain on track to deliver 650,000 new passings in 2025. As we talk about fiber, let me provide a brief update on the pending Frontier transaction.\nThe team is working through the necessary steps to complete the acquisition, and we remain on track for an early 2026 close. We have received regulatory approvals from eight states as well as the FCC and DOJ, and are productively engaged with the remaining state regulatory agencies. Based on Frontier's publicly reported results, the company continues to perform extremely well and remains on track with their fiber expansion goals. Our integration planning efforts are well underway, and we anticipate a smooth transition upon the deal closing. We are looking forward to having Frontier's assets serve as an important catalyst for our fiber expansion and broadband growth acceleration. Turning to our financial results, we delivered another strong quarter. Q2 consolidated revenue reached $34.5 billion, up 5.2% year-over-year. This result was driven by solid wireless service revenue and a more than 25% increase in wireless equipment revenue.\nService and other revenue rose 1.6%. Total wireless service revenue reached $20.9 billion in the Q2, a 2.2% increase year-over-year. Growth was driven by consumer ARPU, which rose 2.3% year-over-year. We realized benefits from recent pricing actions, expansion of fixed wireless access, and increased revenue from perks and other adjacent services. Our robust perk offerings continue to grow at a steady pace, keeping us on track to achieve our goal of 15 million perks by year-end and providing a healthy contribution to service revenue. In addition, prepaid revenue has reached a turning point and was flat in the Q2 compared to the prior year period. We expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we are well positioned for continued service revenue growth with healthy underlying customer economics.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.8 billion, which is the highest we have ever reported and an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year period. Wireless service revenue growth, coupled with the benefits from cost savings initiatives, more than offset the impact from the elevated upgrade activity. Through first half 2025, both wireless service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are up nearly $1 billion from the prior year, reflecting strong operating leverage. Within that result, the business segment EBITDA has now grown for three consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. From a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete, generating substantial savings. In addition, we're actively pursuing opportunities within our legacy businesses. These include Copper decommissioning, and savings from the managed services initiative within our business segment, among other cost efficiency programs.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.22 in the quarter, up 6.1% year-over-year, primarily due to the strength in adjusted EBITDA. Turning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of the year was $16.8 billion, up more than 1% compared with the same period a year ago. CapEx for the first half of 2025 came in at $8 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year period. We continue to realize efficiencies in our C-Band deployment and Fios expansion, enabling us to effectively meet or exceed our network goals well within our capital budget. For the first half of the year, the net effect of cash flow from operations and CapEx resulted in pre-cash flow of $8.8 billion, an increase of 3.6% compared to the same period a year ago.\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $116 billion, a $6.9 billion improvement year-over-year. In the first half of the year, our debt reduction was offset by non-cash mark-to-market adjustments. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.2 times improvement year-over-year and in line with the prior quarter. We continue to make progress towards our long-term leverage target ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction. Our balance sheet remains a significant strength of our organization. Notably, we have under $700 million in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. We will continue to focus on reducing debt ahead of completing the Frontier transaction. As Hans mentioned earlier, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged.\nWe will continue to strategically invest in the business, enhancing our mobile and broadband networks, support a healthy and growing dividend, and paying down debt towards our long-term leverage target. As we've mentioned previously, we will consider buybacks once we reach our leverage target. Our strong operational execution in the first half of the year, coupled with favorable tax reform, gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for the full year. Given the strong Adjusted EBITDA performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full-year guidance to 2.5% to 3.5% growth, an increase of approximately $125 million at the midpoint. We are increasing our guidance for Adjusted EPS growth to a range of 1% to 3% to reflect a new Adjusted EBITDA outlook. We are raising our 2025 Free Cash Flow guidance to a range of $19.5 to 20.5 billion.\nThe increase is driven by an estimated benefit of $1.5 to 2 billion from the recently enacted tax legislation, as well as the disciplined operational execution that drove our strong Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance in the first half of the year. Our wireless service revenue and CapEx guidance remains unchanged. As we get closer to the closing of the Frontier transaction, we expect to provide an update on our broadband plans as well as our capital allocation strategy. In summary, we have a resilient business model with a high-quality customer base and continue to execute well in both mobility and broadband. Our Q2 financial performance reflects our disciplined approach to growth, and we are well positioned to deliver on our improved outlook in the second half of the year. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Tony. Our strong first half results reaffirm our confidence in Verizon's strategy. Our strategic execution and the ongoing momentum across our business underpin our decision to raise full-year guidance. Our focus remains clear. We are committed to growing wireless service revenue, expanding Adjusted EBITDA, and generating strong free cash flow. We will achieve this through three key priorities. First, building on the network leadership to create compelling customer offerings that accelerate growth in our mobility and broadband businesses. Secondly, maintaining operational excellence and financial discipline across the organization. Thirdly, scaling our next-generation platforms from capturing new enterprise opportunities with private networks to enabling AI at scale and unlocking new revenue streams from our existing assets. The opportunities ahead are significant, and a pending Frontier acquisition will accelerate our fiber strategy. Verizon's unique market position and the essential nature of our services are fundamental to empowering individuals, businesses, and society.\nVerizon has the assets, the strategy, and most importantly, the team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. With that, Brady, it's time for Q&A.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad Ray for questions.\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. Your name is required to introduce your question. If at any point your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your request, you may remove yourself by pressing star two. One moment for the first question. The first question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning.I want to ask about free cash flow, kind of capital allocation, and then also the outlook for consumer wireless. Hans and Tony, you guys have meaningfully more cash flow to play with now. I know you said $1.5 to 2 billion this year. I think these tax benefits continue beyond 2025. What's the best use of incremental capital at Verizon from your perspective? I know you laid out your priorities, but can you help us think about your ambition to get to buyback sooner, build more fiber faster, et cetera, et cetera? On the consumer wireless front, should we still expect consumer net add improvement, postpaid net add improvement in 2025 versus 2024? I don't think that was reiterated on the prepared remarks.\nMaybe you could talk a little bit about the churn outlook in the second half, where you'll be moving beyond the price increases, and so whether we should still be expecting kind of churn normalization. Thanks so much.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. Let me start with the capital allocation. I think your comments and question there is more than valid. As you saw, we raised our guidance for free cash flow partly because of our cash flow from operation is improving, but also the tax reform that we indicated how much it is. As I said before, I mean, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. I mean, it's first of all in our business, and we have increased the CapEx this year compared to 2024. The dividend, of course, 18 years of increase. We want to put the board in a position to continue to grow. We pay down our debt.\nWe pay down our debt again with almost $3 billion in the first half, and then it will be buybacks. Now we are in a situation where we are just about, or in the couple of months from now, in the beginning of next year, closing Frontier. So what I said in my prepared remarks is I want to get a holistic view on all the capital allocation. I mean, how are we going to invest in fiber? What synergies we see? How are we going to do the capital allocation priorities? But clearly, the tax reform is helping us to get faster to the priorities we have. So we feel good about that, but let me come back to that so we can give you a holistic view on capital allocation. But clearly, we are very excited about Frontier. The performance is great. The synergies are great.\nAnd of course, the convergence and the fiber opportunities are also great. So, very excited for that. And so far, Frontier has performed really good. On the wireless consumer, I think that our ambition, as was outlined by Sampath in the beginning of the year, doing better this year is still valid. I mean, there's no difference on that. However, we're going to continue to be very financially disciplined. For us, we will not sacrifice our financials just to getting net adds if it doesn't make sense, if it's too expensive. You saw us in the Q4 last year being aggressive because we saw the opportunities of creating and gaining a lot of high-quality customers. You saw our gross adds in the Q2. So it all depends where the market is and where we go.\nUltimately, our goal is to increase our service revenue and then expand our EBITDA and cash flow. That's our main KPIs. Then on churn, Tony will probably chime in on all of this. On churn, expected in Q2 was elevated, coming from the price ups, but also from the competitive environment. I think the whole industry is up. Sampath put in a lot of very important churn measurements, 624, that now is tweaking, going through our system, all our AI-empowered customer service impacting. So very encouraged about what the team is doing and how they are working on the loyalty and retention of our customers. So that's all a little bit. Tony will chime in on all three, I guess.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Ben. So a couple of things on churn. Obviously, we're focused on reducing churn in a financially disciplined manner.\nAs Hans mentioned, we have a great value proposition with the Verizon Value Guarantee and also My Biz on the business side. We have further deployment of C-Band. We said we're going to get to 80% to 90% of C-Band this year deployed, and we see lower churn where C-Band is deployed. Then the work that Hans mentioned on customer experience, we did a CX launch on 24 June, and that work is also augmented by AI, and we expect to see improvements there. Then obviously, convergence will also reduce mobility churn. The team has the retention tools to get there, and they're focused on it. Then one other comment just on tax reform, as your question around looking ahead, we're not going to guide on 2026, but the extensions of bonus and R&E are permanent.\nSo while we won't guide on 2026, I would expect that the impacts in 2026 would be significant.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thanks so much.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ben. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two, if I can. First, it looks like you saw further deceleration in postpaid ARPA growth. Can you just talk a little bit about the drivers that are causing that deceleration? And then a follow-up on one of the comments. Upgrade rates in the teens in the first half, and you expect mid-single digits for the year. What's the driver of what would suggest to be a pretty rapid deceleration in the upgrades? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. On the postpaid ARPA, I think, again, I mean, we have been growing our ARPA for a long time, and we continue to do. We have many levers in there all the way from our broadband, my step-ups; only 50% of our customers on My Plan. We had the adjacent services. You heard when we had our prepared remarks on our perks, basically doubling this year up to 15 million perks. So we have a lot of drivers for it. So we still believe that we have a good run rate on that. On the upgrades, as you articulated, we have been down eight quarters of the last nine when it comes to upgrades for many reasons. This quarter, we put in, first of all, a couple of incentives for customers to upgrade. So that's why we saw a little bit higher.\nBut remember, when we talk about the mid-single digits, that's both business and consumer. That's the total investment we have in upgrades.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. And then just a couple of other points on the upgrades. I mean, we absorbed the higher upgrades. The upgrades were up 30% year-over-year, and we still produced strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter. So we had good operating leverage across the board there.\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nOkay. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, John. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThe next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks for the question. Just to follow up on Ben and John's theme there for a second, as we think about the consumer net add results in the quarter, any way to unpack maybe free line contribution interquarter?\nI know that was a below-the-line offer that was in market, as well as anything to quantify or read through from the deceleration in core prepaid down pretty materially sequentially. Is there any migration activity within the quarter there? And then lastly, on the Frontier deal close, you said early 2026. Is that implying a later-than-expected close versus Q1 2026 was the previous guidance, given maybe some utility commission reviews that are ongoing out there? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nNo, we can start with the Frontier. No, nothing has changed. It's on the plan we said actually since we announced the acquisition. So it's the Q1 of 2026. So nothing has changed on that. And then on any particular things on our net adds, first of all, we had a great gross add. I mean, the team did a great job. Our sales channels were working.\nOur product is resonating with the market. The free lines were insignificant. It was part of the 624 launch, and it just was on for a very short time period, and it's off right now. So that had nothing to do with it. It was a really good execution by the team.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nAnd then on prepaid, as you can see, the segmentation strategy is working. And the operational rigor now that we have is paying dividends, and we have four straight quarters of growth in our prepaid business. And we're seeing good results across all of our main brands, whether it's Straight Talk, Visible, or Total Wireless, and we continue to scale the distribution there.\nThe other thing I want to point out on prepaid is now that we have four straight quarters of volume growth, we've reached an inflection point, and we now expect prepaid will be a contributor to service revenue growth in the second half of 2025. We feel good about the progress and the momentum we have in the prepaid business.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nJust a quick follow-up there. Within prepaid to postpaid migrations, the 19% increase in gross additions in the quarter, would that reflect any migrations across the base?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nNo. Not significant for us.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nNo.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nOkay. Yeah. Thanks, Sebastiano. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you maybe broadly comment on the broadband market trends that you're seeing right now.\nI think you talked about a softer move environment, but what are you seeing in terms of the gross add environment more broadly across both fixed wireless and Fios heading into the back half of this year? Any change in competitive dynamics that would make you feel more or less confident about your ability to sustain better net additions into the back half? And specifically, can you maybe comment on your expectation for fixed wireless ads and whether they can improve and recover heading into year-end? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Jim. When it comes to broadband, the first half year, I mean, Fios has been fairly consistent, but of course, what we saw here in the Q2 was a way lower mover market. I mean, still, the product is the best product out there. The churn is very low, performing really well.\nOn the fixed wireless access, it's the same phenomenon we talked before. As we go suburban and rural to the 80%, 90% of C-Band, that's where we create the opportunities for fixed wireless access, as it's the secondary business case on our build. And that means that we have less passing, so whatever we call it in fixed wireless access world, we have less open for sale. So that's very natural. If I look into Q2, I'm pretty certain we will do better on broadband in the second half this year than we did in the first.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAnd maybe could you just comment on the status of your MDU rollout? I know it's in trial phases right now, but would you expect that to be a significant contributor as we head into 2026?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo the MDU solution, which is the world's first, again, Verizon is leading with a solution that nobody else has done. That is more than trials right now, even though it's a smaller scale where in many states we start rolling it out. We want to have a short time period between we have the product and we talk to the landlords. It's going to start scaling even more in the second half. I think it will be a bigger contributor in 2026 than in 2025. But it's a great product that can get very, very good broadband services all the way up to 1 gig, which is something extraordinary that the guys have been doing. But we will scale to see that we have the highest quality that Verizon is known for and is our trademark. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jim. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Rollins\n\nManaging Director of Citi Research, Citigroup\n\nThanks. And good morning. Two topics, convergence and then EBITDA. So first on convergence, curious if you could share an update on how Verizon's progressing with the uptake of these converged bundles within the base. And if you can share how Verizon's looking to differentiate your converged offers versus the competition. And then on EBITDA, you referenced that it was up 4% in the Q2, first half, and that's better than the guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. So can you unpack within the full year guidance, what you're anticipating for the rest of the year, and what are the factors that would put you at the high end versus the low end of that range?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nI can start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Tony.\nBut on the convergence, I think that, of course, our main key differentiator is that we have owners' economics on mobility and broadband. We have the biggest mobility base, and we're now adding our fiber base with Frontier. So we're going to have an unparalleled opportunity for convergence that our customers have a chance to work on both. And as I said before, we have a very high degree on our broadband net adds per quarter that are already converged. So it's more about when we're going to scale that opportunity. We have even more chances. And if you think about coming into the Frontier footprint when that's approved, we have a huge opportunity for convergence. So we're excited over that, and that's our offering.\nAnd on EBITDA, before Tony says something, I think you see right now our leverage, the cost takeouts we've done, the growth we're doing, and it's falling straight down to the bottom line. We will continue to focus on that. As I said so many times before, the whole executive management and the whole company had three KPIs. It's the service revenue growth, and then it's EBITDA and cash flow generation. Very good start of the year.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans. Hey, Mike. On the EBITDA, we were up over $500 million in the quarter and about $1 billion of EBITDA growth year-to-date. That's also in light of having a pretty significant upgrade activity, mostly driven by the launch of our value guarantee. We stayed very disciplined in the quarter. We didn't chase volumes, and it gave us the confidence.\nThe resiliency in the business gave us the confidence to raise the guide. It starts with the top-line revenue, and service revenue is up 2.4% year-to-date. We're seeing great operating leverage, as Hans mentioned. There's a lot of work going on on the cost side of the house to continue to make the business a lot more efficient in serving customers day in and day out. If you think about the customer care and the work we launched on 24 June 2024, that includes having AI-enabled customer care, managed services. We're seeing great progress now with the managed services work that Kyle and the team are doing, and we're seeing good savings here ramping up in 2025. The network team continues to take out cost and legacy network elements, and that includes copper decommissioning, and that work is ongoing.\nAnd then even in business wireline, we continue to de-emphasize low-margin deals and stay very disciplined there. And then from a headcount standpoint, the voluntary separation program is now behind us, and we're seeing a full run rate benefit for the balance of the year. So there's really no assumption changes in upgrades. As you asked before, we said mid-single digits for the full year. That still stays intact. And what we've said is volumes are important, but we're going to stay disciplined in our approach and in support of the three measures that Hans mentioned: service revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. And we'll pulse in, pulse out where it makes sense, but we're not going to chase unprofitable growth for the sake of net adds.\nBut very pleased with the progress on EBITDA in first half and very comfortable raising the guidance for second half.\n\nMike Rollins\n\nManaging Director of Citi Research, Citigroup\n\nThanks.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Mike. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kutgun Maral of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKutgun Maral\n\nMedia, Cable and Telecom Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about your wireless go-to-market strategy. I know you pulse in and out of the market, Tony, just like you said, but looking through some of your postpaid offers in Q2, at times there seemed to have been a bit more promotional activity on the device side targeting the value end.\nOver the last few years, you've expanded your portfolio in the segments that you target with TracFone and Fixed Wireless, for example, but the value end had historically been perhaps less of a focus on the postpaid side. So I was curious if this was more of an opportunistic tilt that was specific to the quarter or if it's part of a more strategic shift in the way that you expect to go to market moving forward. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. First of all, Sampath and the team together with our CMO, Leslie, have been working really hard to segment up our market. Because as we see the market having less and less new customers coming into the market, a segmented approach becomes important. We're running now, I think, eight or nine different brands. All of them have different brand attributes and appealing to different segmentations.\nSo this is sort of a segmented growth strategy we have in wireless for consumer, and that will continue and just refine it and see that we have the right offerings in all the different types of brands we have. I would say some of the brands are doing extraordinarily well. I mean, Total Wireless, Visible, very good, very targeted. Some of them have some sort of promotions. Some of them are just having a service fee. So it's very different, and you're going to see us continue doing that work because that is part of our growth story, that we can actually meet any consumer with different economic background with the service. And as you can see in this quarter and the previous quarters, we were actually excited about those opportunities.\n\nKutgun Maral\n\nMedia, Cable and Telecom Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, Hans.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Kut and Brad. We're ready for the next question.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nManaging Director of Telecommunications Services, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you. Can you talk to us about the pace of the fixed wireless deployment? Are you seeing that increase? Doing more investment there, or is that kind of staying the same? And then can you characterize the promotion activity in July? Do you think that's going to be similar this quarter with seasonality? How should we think about that? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. On the pace on fixed wireless access, that's not changing at all. I mean, we are gearing up for reaching 80% and 90% of C-Band this year, and that's where we followed through with our fixed wireless access opportunities. And by next year, we're going to have basically built all our C-Band on top of the grid we defined from the beginning.\nAfter that, we can always debate how we're going to continue to allocate capital. But right now, we allocate capital for mobility for the simple reason that where we build the C-Band, we have better step-ups, we have better upgrades from our customers. So that's the number one. But let us finish this, and then we're going to see. But the pace has not changed. The same C-Band build-out. What you see on the CapEx is actually also an efficiency work. We're doing everything that was planned for 2025 right now, but we do it more efficient. The network team is doing a great job, actually creating efficiencies on our CapEx, and that's very important for us going forward when we're also going to have Frontier inside.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nManaging Director of Telecommunications Services, Raymond James\n\nYep. Got it.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Frank. Brad Ray for the next question.\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nCable & Satellite, Telecom, and IT Hardware Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. I want to follow up to Ben's first question where you talked about capital allocation. Under the new budget or the One Big Beautiful Bill, there is an expectation of significant spectrum sales, even though the spectrum hasn't been identified. Can you just talk a little bit about that as to how you would prioritize spectrum purchases if there's either a government option or alternatively if private market spectrum comes available from EchoStar as to how that might affect, for example, your discussion about possible share buybacks?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. When it comes to spectrum, I mean, I think that we are sitting on a really good position on spectrum. And with our C-Band, millimeter wave, and our low band, and that's what you see us deploying right now. So we feel good about where we are with spectrum.\nThen I've said all the time that the US over time needs more spectrum, especially as 6G comes up, etc., in order to stay competitive and being the most digitalized country in the world. So we're, of course, thinking it's good. That's part of the bill. But as you rightfully said, it still needs to be optional. It has to be free up spectrum and all of that, and that will take some time. When it comes to, in general, our capital allocation to spectrum, we always do the build versus buy. I mean, we have done it way before I joined. We look into, will this buy this spectrum being better than building on our own spectrum today? That's the comparison we're always going to do when we see spectrum in the market.\nBut again, we feel good about the position we have, and we are encouraged that the government is planning over time to bring more spectrum to the market for the competitiveness of the United States of America.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nCable & Satellite, Telecom, and IT Hardware Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Craig. Ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Funk\n\nSVP, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. So on postpaid phone subscriber acquisition cost, what are you seeing for the increase in acquisition cost year-over-year? And then what are you modeling for second half? And what's the right mix of budget for retention versus acquisition?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nYou know this is close to how we work constantly between Sampat, me, and Tony, seeing that we have an envelope for the full investment of customers, which is including acquisition, retention, and media.\nTo give you an exact number, that wouldn't be appropriate. But I think that what you should be feeling confident about, that we weekly think about what is the best allocation that we get the best return on investment on the LTV and getting the right customers to over retention or acquisition. So that is a fluid work we're doing constantly, and we have improved this dramatically over the years. Before, it was an overall budget. Now it's a much more dynamic, but we stay within the financial discipline we have, so we're not overshooting on anything.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Great. Thanks, Mike. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Greg Williams of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowens\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. First one's just on the consumer phone gross adds. You guys said you're disciplined and not chasing volumes, but it's up 19%. I think that's a Q2 record. How sustainable is this level of gross adds going forward in the balance of the year? The second question just on the Customer Experience that you guys launched on 24 June 2024 because you're talking it up quite a bit here. Wanted to get more color on what it is and the specifics. You mentioned AI-enabling customer care, etc. So any color there would be great. Thanks.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nOkay. Sure. Greg, on the gross adds, a couple of things here. The strength came from two places. First, we had very strong sales execution in our stores and distribution. The team did a great job. Then secondly, the value proposition, when you think about we launched the Best Value Guarantee back at the beginning of April, and that is resonating with customers in the market. We see a healthy mix of new to Verizon in the quarter, and we're also writing good business as well. What we said many times is volumes are important, and we'll pulse in and pulse out, but where it makes financial sense. Then, as we said earlier, the biggest opportunity for us is loyalty and retention, and the team is focused on it.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. If we talk about what was launched 24 June 2024, I think that it was a lot of AI-supported customer experience tools we put in. I mean, first of all, when it comes to the process, we now will have a customer care employee following a request or a complaint from our customers all the way. So we actually finish it out with the same person starting and ending, and also having updates.\nThat was a concern for our customers that we heard through the year and that we needed to improve. The other thing is we're also opening up our customer service 24/7. Very important. Again, that was a feedback that people are having different work hours. They want to call different times. We're going to fix that. And then, of course, we're giving our customer care employees an AI tool so they can treat our customer better and know their problems better because this could be stressful. We know that having the connectivity is such an essential service, mobility and broadband. And then the last thing, we're going to leverage even more our stores. I mean, 93% of the US population has less than 30 minutes to Verizon store.\nWe're going to leverage that more, see that that's going to be a place where we can get more support and help as well. So we leverage all the assets and all our employees to see that we're treating our customer better. I think it's an area we can excel in. Then we basically have worked a lot on our product side where we have My Plan, My Biz, My Home, all of that with perks, which is really resonating. We have worked on the brand that we refreshed the brand last year, and that is actually going really good as well. The network is, of course, the best network in the market that once again was proven by J.D. Power and RootMetrics.\nSo we're working on all the cylinders, how we compete for any type of customer, all the way from enterprise, government, small and medium to prepaid, postpaid customers on broadband and mobility. So it's a holistic thinking how we're going to do this. So thank you for the question.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowens\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Greg. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Media & Entertainment, Telecom & Cable, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Hi. Good morning, everybody. A question about costs and one about churn on costs. You mentioned your expectations for continuing cost efficiency, and we see obviously headcount is flat year-to-date in your reporting compared to 5% improvement or decline in 2024. And so thinking at medium term, thinking about 2026, 2027, I wonder if you could describe any opportunities you see for ongoing efficiency gains outside of price increases.\nThen on churn, now that we're well past the impact of extended installment plans on consumer churn, what do you think is the cause of today's churn levels? Obviously, your initiatives in June indicate some incremental concern. Does that trend require less aggressive, less positive price increases in the future? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nFirst of all, any future commercial plans, I will not share. That I cannot do. I start with the cost. I think that both Tony and I see more cost opportunities than we have seen in a long time. That's what you see in our leverage right now. Many of the AI solutions we're putting in, we talked about them last year, we're putting into our both in the capital planning for our customers, for our employees. That's still not into any cost base for us.\nThe headcount, we have been very, very good, and it's going down all the time. So we have been very efficient on managing our resources that is handling this market. So very happy with that. I hand it over to Tony to talk a little bit more about cost and the churn.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks. So Peter, a couple of things. The headcount's down 3.7% year-over-year. As I said earlier, we had a lot of EBITDA margin expansion in the first half. We continue to take cost out, whether it's AI, whether it's network. The team continues to take copper out of the network, and network continues. Whether it's IT or real estate, IT platform consolidation or real estate, we're continuing to push cost out of the business.\nEven on business wireline, as I said before, we're being really disciplined at the deal desk. Even on wireless, we're being disciplined at the deal desk as well. We're not chasing growth for the sake of growth. As Hans said, we're operating differently, and we feel good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements and also the increase in the guide.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Media & Entertainment, Telecom & Cable, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\nAll right. Yeah. Thanks, Peter. Brad Ray for the next question.\nThe next question is from Brian Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst of Media, Cable, Telecom, & Video Games, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good morning. I just had a question on BEAD. With the recent changes in the program, I was wondering how you're thinking about the opportunity to participate and maybe make some incremental investments into footprint expansion through that program. Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThanks. Yeah.There are some slight changes to the BEAD program rules, which open up some opportunities for us, of course. And then it's a process of rebuilding. I think that's one area. The other area, of course, we have been building since the first BEAD opportunity came up. So the combination of this probably that we have the same opportunities as we had when the BEAD program started. We're going to bid where we see that we have a good return and with some subsidized from the government. So no major change for us. We are in this process right now. So need to come back to you when we see the outcome of that rebuilding.\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Bryan. Brad, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Cloud and Communication Services, Oppenheimer\n\nBecause the business revenues and margins have improved pretty substantially. Just any more color on what you're doing there? I know you touched on it a little bit, but can you give us a little bit more examples of what's going on? And I guess the key question is, is it secular? And I guess particularly on the margins.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. Yeah. It's a lot going on there. I mean, some of you have been following us for quite a while. You know that somewhere in 2023, our performance was not the best. We took a lot of decisions, including getting basically a totally new management team. Since then, we have been aligning on what we need to do. And you see so many vectors of growth that we didn't have before. I mean, all the way from fiber, fixed wireless access.\nOf course, the fiber will be added in the Frontier over time. You see our AI Connect that we talk about on the business side. Suddenly, we can leverage our assets on the fixed side. We have the adjacent services that, a couple of years ago, were very small. Now, with the perks and all of that, we're doubling the growth there. So we have the convergence coming up as well. We have prepaid that Tony talked about that was zero or negative for us for quite a while. Now we're basically flattish and, of course, expecting that the team is going there. And then we have all the step-up and the segmented growth that I talked about. So the team is executing really good.\nIn the foundation, we have a great network that we now are sort of capturing all the opportunities with the C-Band investment we did a couple of years ago. And that's what you see. And then on top of that, with the discipline from Tony and the team, we're taking out cost. And then you see the leverage. And sometimes we just underestimate what great business this is. I mean, it's an enormous business when it comes to revenue and subscriber-based services. And the generational cash is extraordinary. We will just continue to drive that and see that we have the right offerings for our customer. But that's what's behind it. Really well executed and what you should expect from Verizon, which is our trademark.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks. And then, Hans, just a couple of things to add, Tim, on the business segment.\nThe team continues to grow volumes, both mobility and FWA. The business continues to skew more wireless, which is great to see. We said the goal was to improve the EBITDA profile in this segment. We saw really good progress in the first half of the year. We have three straight quarters now of growth. So if you look between the revenue and the margins on the revenue side, as I said, more wireless, FWA, and mobility growing, even though we're growing through even the public sector pressures as well. We're also seeing contributions from private 5G networks and AI Connect. That's also offsetting some of the wireline decline that we see. Then on the cost side, Kyle and the team doing a great job with our managed services transformation.\nThe deal we signed with HCL is providing a lot of benefits this year and a lot of good discipline in terms of moving customers off of legacy progress products, rather, and de-emphasizing low-margin deals and also operating with lower headcount. So we're well positioned to continue to improve the business EBITDA margins this year. Very happy with the progress.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Cloud and Communication Services, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Tim. Brad, that's all the time we have today.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for participating and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the call will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our Q1 2025 earnings call and customer value update. I'm Brady Connor, and on the call with me this morning are Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Skiadas, our Chief Financial Officer; and we have our Consumer Group CEO, Sampath, who will provide an update on our consumer strategy. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found at the start of the investor presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results are contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Discussions and comments related to our 2025 guidance exclude any assumptions regarding the potential effects of the tariff environment, owing to the uncertain and evolving nature of these impacts. Earlier this morning, a detailed overview of our Q1 results was posted to our Investor Relations website. We also posted supplemental materials relating to today's call on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by addressing the evolving policy and macroeconomic landscape. We continue to monitor the ongoing developments, and we're confident in our ability to effectively manage our business for our customers and shareholders. In periods of heightened uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength, given the importance and the essential nature of our connectivity services, the size and quality of our customer base, and the strength of our balance sheet. Our diverse portfolio of offerings serves all market segments and positions us for success in any economic environment. With our bias for action and position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment but thrive in it. Now, let me turn to our results. We had an exceptional financial start of the year, delivering strong growth across our key financial metrics.\nWire service revenue was up 2.7% at the high end of our guided range. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion was our highest reported result ever, growing 4% and exceeding our guided range. Free cash flow was up over $900 million and enabled continued execution of our capital allocation priorities. Even with the recent declines in consumer confidence, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance. Our comprehensive portfolio of offerings and strategic moves we have made over the last years position us well for sustainable financial and subscriber growth, while also improving the customer experience. These moves include our brand refresh, along with continued evolution of our customer-first offerings, such as myPlan, myHome, and My Biz Plan, organic and inorganic broadband expansion with a pending acquisition of Frontier, AI Connect, and satellite partnerships that enable texting anywhere for free.\nRootMetrics recently recognized Verizon as the best, fastest, and most reliable 5G network in the US, and our network continues to get even better. On mobility, we're on track to deploy C-band to 80% to 90 of our planned sites by year-end, and we are aggressively rolling out 5G Advanced features. On fiber expansion, we're ahead of our plan year-to-date to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year. On Fixed Wireless Access, our multi-dwelling unit solution is expected to gradually ramp over time, along with continued expansion of homes and businesses covered with the ongoing C-band deployment. Turning to our operational performance, our segmentation strategy focused on delivering targeted offerings is yielding positive results. We delivered a year-over-year improvement in combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds.\nWe did have a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn due to recent price ups and pressure from federal government accounts. However, our prepaid net adds of 137,000 were the best since the TracFone acquisition. In broadband, we continue to take share. With Fixed Wireless Access and fiber, we have the most complete offering covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over time. Our Fixed Wireless Access product continues to lead our broadband growth, and we have great momentum to reach our next milestone of 8 to 9 million Fixed Wireless Access subscribers by 2028. We're excited to expand our broadband opportunity and continue to scale our mobile and home offerings as we work towards closing the Frontier transaction.\nThe Consumer Group's multi-year business transformation effort is progressing as planned, and you'll hear more about that from Sampath shortly. In the business group, our private networks business continued to scale. We closed more than a dozen deals in the quarter, including private networks for AdventHealth and Nucor. We were named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for managed IoT connectivity services worldwide and reached an agreement to deliver a turnkey IoT solution for Atlanta Hawks. We have seen accelerated interest in AI Connect and continue to expand our partner ecosystem. Looking ahead, our priorities are clear: a continued focus on growing wireless service revenue, expanding adjusted EBITDA, and generating strong free cash flow, accelerating our mobility and broadband growth, and scaled private networks. Leverage our existing fiber and edge compute assets to unlock new revenue streams through our AI Connect offerings.\nFocus on financial discipline, operational excellence, and customer experience. Finally, execute on our capital allocation priorities: invest in the business, support and grow our dividend, pay down debt, and eventually share repurchases. With that, I turn the call over to Tony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As we reported earlier, Q1 demonstrated our ability to drive strong financial growth with wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of our guided range. Additionally, we had our best-ever reported Adjusted EBITDA result at $12.6 billion, and we delivered an over $900 million improvement in free cash flow from the prior year. We improved our total combined postpaid and core prepaid phone net adds year-over-year. We're taking share in broadband, and we continue to innovate with myPlan, myHome, and our new My Biz Plan to deliver best-in-class value across all of our customers. Our consumer postpaid phone net losses of $356,000 reflect the impact of recent pricing actions. We exited Q1 with positive momentum.\nConsumer postpaid phone gross adds in March were up mid-single digits from the prior year, and the performance in April continues to be strong. Additionally, our new three-year price lock and free phone guarantee is resonating in the market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds year-over-year for the full year. Business phone net adds were 67,000 in the period, impacted by pressure within federal government accounts. We continue to work with customers of all sizes to deliver connectivity solutions that match their needs. Our momentum continued to build in core prepaid, where we delivered 137,000 net adds. Our strong execution and investment in Visible, Total Wireless, and Straight Talk is paying off, and we continue to expect positive service revenue contribution from core prepaid in the second half of the year.\nIn broadband, our Fios and Fixed Wireless Access offerings are attracting new customers quarter after quarter. We had 339,000 net adds in the period, and we continue to take market share. This is a solid start to the year and one we expect to build on as we expand our C-Band and fiber availability. Shifting to financials, we delivered strong results with 2.7% wireless service revenue growth. This reflects the benefits of pricing actions, expansion of Fixed Wireless Access subscribers, and continued adoption of perks and premium plans. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion grew 4% in the quarter, which represents our best quarter of year-over-year growth in nearly four years and demonstrates our sustained and disciplined approach to growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.19 for the quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year.\nFinally, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion positions us to continue to pay down debt in alignment with our capital allocation priorities and ahead of the anticipated close of the Frontier transaction. In closing, we are pleased with the financial performance we saw in the quarter. As Hans mentioned, we have a lot of experience managing through uncertainty in the broader economy, and we have a product portfolio that allows us to compete effectively in any environment. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational and financial goals for 2025. I will now turn the call back over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Tony. Now, let's discuss our strategic approach to the consumer market to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth. It all starts with how we compete and go to market. Our network is the foundation of everything we offer. We have the best and most reliable network, and we continue to extend our network leadership with our ongoing C-Band deployment and broadband expansion with Fixed Wireless Access and fiber, including the pending acquisition of Frontier. Our customer-first connectivity offerings deliver unmatched control, value, and simplicity for all our customer segments. Over the last two years, we have introduced targeted offers for all customer segments across mobility and broadband. As the market leader, we remain committed to introducing new and innovative offerings that meet the evolving needs of our customers. Next is the value-added services, which is one of our key differentiators in the market.\nWe offer add-on perks, including exclusive discounts on some of the top streaming services such as Netflix and Max. Given the size and the quality of our base and the scale of our distribution network, we offer rates that customers cannot find anywhere else, and we will continue to expand our perk portfolio. Over the past few years, we have dedicated substantial resources and capital to enhance our customer experience through various initiatives, including AI for customer care and personalization. Although the industry, including Verizon, still has room to improve, we have made great progress towards our goal of seamless customer interactions. Lastly, our brand is a pivotal element in our go-to-market strategy. Recognizing its importance, we made the strategic decision to refresh our brand last year, and we are committed to further developing and strengthening our brand to drive continued growth and customer engagement.\nBy focusing on these key pillars of our value proposition, we attract new customers, foster loyalty among existing ones, and maximize the long-term value of each customer relationship. This holistic approach ensures that we remain competitive in the marketplace and drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth. Now, let me turn to Sampath, who will provide more details on our consumer transformation journey.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nGood morning, everyone. When I stepped into the role of Consumer Unit CEO just over two years ago, Hans and I immediately set a course for a multi-year transformation that offers what customers need in today's increasingly dynamic economic environment. We committed to delivering real value to our customers while driving sustained long-term growth. Let me walk you through our transformation journey and the results so far. Beginning in 2023, we revamped our sales engine, moving to a regional model, individual sales incentives, and a stronger focus on local marketing. We also launched myPlan, giving customers more control, value, and simplicity. This allowed us to significantly reduce our perceived price premium while driving higher average revenue per user through perks, insurance, and financial services. In 2024, we relaunched our brand and accelerated myPlan and myHome adoption.\nWe solidified the Verizon model of convergence with the announcement of the Frontier transaction and ramping up our current in-footprint fiber build. This transaction will help enable our long-term goal of offering broadband to over 100 million premises, including fiber passings of 35 to 40 million. We also turned around our prepaid business, which includes the industry's largest portfolio of brands. This was driven by a revamp of our value propositions, expanded exclusive, and third-party distribution, and instilling the same operational rigor we introduced in our postpaid business. The core prepaid brands returned to subscriber growth in 2024 and achieved their best results since the TracFone acquisition this quarter. This demonstrates our ability to win across all market segments. Customers are responding to our offers, and we anticipate gaining market share in prepaid this year.\nAs we enter year three, we are doubling down on our customer-first strategy with an increased focus on customer retention with the Verizon Value Guarantee: an industry-leading three-year price lock, free phone guarantee for everyone, and savings you cannot get elsewhere. Before I dive into the Verizon Value Guarantee, let us quickly recap what makes our offering stand out from the competition. Our strategic differentiation centers on creating real customer value through a unique combination of network superiority and customer-first offerings. Our myPlan and myHome offerings have been the key drivers of our transformation. These offerings go beyond basic connectivity to include premium entertainment and adjacent services that deliver significant savings for the customer. Today, you can get eight of the most popular streaming services from Verizon for $50. That is value customers can only get at Verizon.\nOur portfolio of adjacent services includes industry-leading insurance products for both mobility and the connected home, and give customers even more peace of mind. We offer even more ways to save through our financial service partners and products, including the Verizon Visa Card and the Openbank high yield Savings Account with Santander, both exclusive to Verizon customers. This business is growing at a double-digit rate and bringing in margin-rich service revenue. Finally, we launched the Verizon Access Loyalty Program, giving customers access to events like the exclusive presale of 100,000 Beyoncé concert tickets, NFL, NBA, and NHL games, and lifetime experiences such as the 140,000 free tickets we gave out to the first Verizon Super Bowl fan fest parties.\nThere is no other plan in the industry like myPlan and myHome, and the beauty of having them built side by side is our ability to offer seamless account linkage and promote joint offers. For converged customers, our retention rates are significantly better than those with just mobility or broadband, validating our convergence strategy. Simply put, we offer the most differentiated value proposition in the industry, and with our recently launched offers for both new and existing customers, we are delivering what people want and need on their terms. So now let's turn to what we announced a few weeks ago. We launched a game-changing offer: a three-year price lock and a free phone guarantee with trade-in for new and existing customers. This offer was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and is a key component of our strategy to deliver sustainable growth.\nThe premise of this offer began several quarters ago as emerging consumer trends showed a growing desire for predictability, price control, and value, all things that are particularly relevant in today's economic environment. Customers want peace of mind, and we are giving them just that. The key elements of this offer include a three-year price lock guarantee that covers the network portion of all tiers of myPlan and myHome, and current customers were automatically enrolled on day one, guaranteed trade-in credit for phones to new and existing customers within their plan tiers, free satellite text messaging on all plans. Customers should not have to pay for texting, and it's part of the value we provide to our customers. Customers love our perks and the massive savings they deliver. We had over 10 million perk subscriptions at the end of the Q1.\nWe now anticipate 15 million subscriptions on our platform by the end of this year, an increase of 1 million perks from our prior forecast in the year-end 2025. They love getting more value for their money with Verizon Visa Card and Openbank high yield Savings Account. And customers with both mobile and home services get a free monthly perk that will drive customer loyalty. We did not just launch an offer. We set a new standard for customer value, and customers are responding very well. Early indicators in April suggest strong gross add momentum and very good reception from customers, including many new customers attracted to Verizon. We expect the Verizon Value Guarantee to provide many benefits to Verizon. First, growth. We will continue to drive revenue through higher volumes, higher premium mix, perk adoption, and upgrading customers to myPlan.\nAll of that is in addition to revenue benefits from our growing FWA base, along with the wholesale business and the momentum with prepaid, which we expect to turn service revenue positive in the second half of the year. Second, better customer retention. In the past, we've made necessary price adjustments, which impacted churn. But we expect trends to improve through the year, and this launch puts us on a path to get back to the lowest churn in the industry over time. And third, we have constructed this offer in a flexible manner to give us continued financial discipline. The price lock applies to myPlan and myHome network plans only. It doesn't apply to perks, discounts, taxes, or fees. And we can still adjust price on legacy plans or introduce new plans if we see an opportunity in the market.\nAnother important note is that the free phone offer will be tiered by plan and require a device trade-in. Overall, we believe this is just the beginning of how we'll earn lasting customer loyalty and continue to grow the Verizon base, including deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds in 2025 compared to 2024. We are back to leading the market, not reacting to it. We are the only carrier with a brand portfolio covering every price point, positioning us for further growth across every segment of the market. The three-year price lock guarantee is the next phase in our consumer transformation, giving consumers the best network, value, and 24/7 support with myPlan and myHome, plus additional peace of mind with the free phone and satellite texting. We want to be people's first choice, providing products, services, and experience they can't get elsewhere.\nWith that, let me turn back to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Sampath. In summary, we are on plan with our multi-year consumer transformation. We're offering the most differentiated value proposition, and we are well-positioned to drive subscriber and financial growth. I'm incredibly proud of the team's dedication and efforts transforming the business. I'm confident that the actions we are taking will set the business up for sustainable long-term growth and extend our industry leadership. Now, Brady, we are ready for questions.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad Ray for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. Your name is required to introduce your question. If at any point your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your request, you may remove yourself by pressing star two. One moment, please, for the first question. The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions, if I could. Maybe first for Hans on the subject of tariffs. Any additional color you can give us on how tariffs on, I guess, first handsets and then telecom equipment could affect the business? On the handset side, do you expect the promotions to sort of scale with tariffs? And what do you expect the impact to be on upgrades? And then on the equipment side, does tariffs on equipment coming into the US mean the budget stays the same and maybe you do less homes passed? Or is it just how that unfolds? Then secondly, for Sampath, thanks for all the color on the consumer segment and the strategy. And thanks for the color on the gross adds leaving the quarter. Can we talk a little bit about churn?\nI mean, is all the new plans, promotions, and offers you have in place, does that help churn in Q2, or do we have to wait till the second half of the year? That comment on getting back to industry-leading churn, is that something you expect to achieve by Q4, by the end of this year? Or just more color on how that plays out would be great. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, John. Let me talk about the tariffs. Of course, tariff is a little bit a moving target for there. But if we take our capital expenditures, it's a very small portion of the $18 billion, which is the midpoint of the guide this year, that it is exposed to any tariffs. And on top of that, we are working with all our suppliers, and we have done so. I mean, during COVID-19, we had no impact at all with the supply chain issues there were because I think my team is the best in the industry to handle that. So that will not change any type of investments we're doing in CapEx or anything. We cannot foresee that. When it comes to handsets, that's also, of course, very early to say where the tariff is going to go and what's going to happen.\nBut in general, if the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we're not planning to cover that in our work. That's just not going to be possible. So we will continue to be financially disciplined in whatever promotions we have, but we will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handsets. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market. But again, it's too early to say. We don't know where tariffs are going to go, but I think my team is well prepared for handling all of it. And on the consumer side, I mean, I think Sampath has talked quite a lot about it. I think that the team has done tremendous work with doing all the new proposals and the new promotions we have had all the way from myPlan, myHome, and all of that.\nNow we come to the third leg with the price lock and the phone guarantee. I think we're right in the moment, and we're leading from a very strong financial position. But I'll let Sampath talk a little bit more about the churn and where we are there.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Hans. We made a decision to price up certain cohorts in December and January, and they were the right trade-offs to make. It helped us lock our revenue for the rest of the year, and it was the right thing to do. Looking Q1, the cohorts that were priced up had higher elasticity than anticipated. The higher churn can be largely attributed and isolated to those cohorts. So because of that, we think churn is transitory. It is abating, and we expect to get back to BAU by the second half of the year. We've got other levers that we are deploying quite aggressively. The first and the biggest one is Verizon Value Guarantee. The three-year price lock and the free phone base is resonating really well, both for our base and for new customers as well. Our second is C-Band expansion.\nAs Joe gets to between 80% and 90% of all macros to be C-Band enabled, you tend to see lower churn when that happens as well. The Verizon model of convergence. Look, we added 339,000 broadband customers between consumer and business and strong volumes, but the vast majority of those customers are converged, which tends to give a benefit to churn. Then lastly is better customer experience. We have a lot of AI-driven customer experiences updates in the funnel in the Q2 and the rest of the year. So given all of this, we feel that churn is transitory, abating, and expected to get back to a BAU posture by the second half of the year.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, John. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nHead of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning. Maybe just to follow the conversation with Sampath, can you talk a little bit about the March and April gross adds improvement and sort of how much that's been tied to specific promotions, including the new three-year price lock? And there was a lot of talk during the Q1 at various conferences about competitive intensity. I didn't really hear you guys talk about that as being something that's incrementally more concerning, etc. So maybe frame the gross adds commentary if you can and sort of the new plans in the context of the competitive environment. And then maybe for Tony, 4% EBITDA growth for the quarter obviously sets you guys up really nicely for the year. I think your business margins were the highest in, I think, since 2021.\nAnything in the quarter around expenses that we should think about as non-recurring or any commentary on how you're feeling about the EBITDA guidance for the year? It seems like you could be trending maybe to the upper end of the range, but I'll let you talk to that if you will. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Ben. I started, and I'm going to hand it over to Sampath and Tony. But on the competitive environment, I think we have seen that for quite a while. I mean, it is a competitive market. We perform well in that market. I think our propositions that we have had in the market are really resonating with our customers, both on the business side and on the consumer side. And then adding also both the wireless business and the broadband business. I mean, the broadband business continued to gain share in this quarter. We have done that for, I'm not sure how many quarters right now, as well as now we turned around the prepaid business as well, which I'm very proud of what the team has done. So I think we're competing well. But of course, it's going to be competitive.\nIt's a great product and it's a great market, but there's nothing new when it comes to that. I would ask Sampath to comment on the momentum that we have gained in March and April. But on the finance, before I move it over to Tony, yeah, what you saw in this quarter is that how hard we worked with efficiency because we have leverage right now. We grow 2.7%, and we have 4% bottom line. Our expenses, if you take away the handsets cost, is down compared to last year. So we're coming down in expenses. The team is doing a great job here. I have to say also on the Verizon business group, they have been on the journey for years right now with the headwind of wireline to take down the cost, at the same time building AI Connect, fiber, broadband business, wireless business.\nNow you start seeing that they turn around, and this is the Q2 of year-over-year growth. I know that Kyle and the team are committed to continue that work. I will start with Sampath talking about the momentum in March and April, and then we'll go over to Tony and talk a little bit more about leverage.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans. Look, it's always a competitive market. We pulse in and out promotions as we see volumes in the market. And when we have an opportunity to go for volumes, we go for it. Look, we have a playbook. We like our playbook. It's an aggressive playbook, but it's also a playbook that lets us win. In March, we started seeing mid-single-digit growth in gross adds in March, and the last two weeks of March was very good and strong for us. As we came into April, we launched the Verizon Value Guarantee, and we are seeing double-digit growth in gross adds. I think that's largely because how well the offer is resonating both for base, as well as new customers coming into the category. So we have good momentum coming out of March and currently in April right now.\nThis gives us comfort that in 2025, we'll have better phone net adds than in 2024 because of the back half of the year, we see churn coming back to a BAU posture and continued momentum on gross adds. The combination of those two is what gives us comfort that we will have a good phone net add year in 2025.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nOkay. Good morning, Ben. So on the EBITDA, on your question, look, we're off to a great start, and we're very confident in the EBITDA guide. It starts with the strong service revenue growth that Hans mentioned at 2.7% and very healthy customer economics when you look at that versus the program amortization as well. As Hans mentioned, we continue to focus on the cost transformation work, and we're always working to make the business more efficient, whether it's the customer care managed services work that Kyle and Sampath are doing day in and day out or the network decommissioning as well. We also completed our voluntary separation program, and we expect to see a full run rate benefit of that for the balance of the year.\nWe've said many times volumes are important, but we're going to drive volumes and be very disciplined in support of our service revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance. And that has not changed at all. On your question on business margins, look, Hans mentioned this earlier. The team is doing a great job in growing the wireless portfolio. If you think about the mix of business shifting more wireless now, Kyle and team have been growing both mobility and FWA for many quarters now. So that mix shift is skewing more wireless. And as that skews more wireless, that brings more margin with it. And we're also seeing some early contribution from private 5G networks and also AI Connect, where we saw improvements in the Q4.\nThen on the cost side, the team continues to take cost out, being very disciplined at the deal desk, particularly on business wireline. Also, the work we're doing around HCL with managed services and also the network DCOMs as well. So we're pleased with the start to the year. Obviously, the goal here is to grow the business margins for the full year, and we're off to a great start.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nHead of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, everybody.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Ben. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first off, on the consumer side, maybe Sampath or Hans, you could talk to the broad sort of behavior you're seeing from consumers from March into April. Are you seeing any kind of significant change in consumer behavior, trade downs, more reticence to upgrade phones? Or actually, are you seeing potentially consumers react to the potential for tariffs and actually pulling forward some of the upgrades into the month of April? I mean, maybe how are you thinking about that, the impact of the sort of knock-on impact of tariffs on consumer behavior? Anything you're seeing in terms of the deterioration of consumer in terms of health, credit metrics, or whatnot? And then maybe as a sort of second question, can you maybe just sort of talk about sort of following on the business EBITDA question?\nI mean, that really sticks out to me as the best growth you've seen in quite some time. Can you maybe talk about the cost metrics underlying that? Are those structural in nature due to the HCL arrangement, or are there any one-time effects that we should think about? And do you think business EBITDA growth is sustainable from here? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. When it comes to consumer behavior, I mean, in general, we haven't seen any major consumer shifts in behavior, even though we read the same articles as everybody else that consumer sentiments come back or coming down. Of course, we have a product, a mobility and broadband that's so essential for our consumers and for our business customers because it's just so relevant. So we haven't seen that. Tony can talk a little about the payments as well, but they continue very intact, no deterioration on payments. Then there have been speculations also of any growth in handsets due to worries for tariffs.\nI think what we can see, and I think Sampath can talk about it, is that we have seen some of the uptick, but I think it comes more from our offering that we start with a new three-year price lock-in, as well as that we had any phone guarantee trade-in. I think that has driven a little bit more handsets for us, not per se. But maybe Sampath and Tony will talk a little bit, and Tony will talk about the margin as well. So let's start with Sampath about the momentum there.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nLook, we have good momentum in our business. In March and April, we were very strong, and April had double-digit growth there. We are seeing good premium mix. In other words, customers of our base, new customers that are taking our premium plans, that mix has actually grown higher. So that suggests that AI value prop is resonating well, and customers like what we offer. In terms of upgrades, look, Q1 was a bit soft, and we didn't chase volumes where there was no demand. We didn't think it made sense for us to chase volumes there. For the whole year, I think we are still committing to a mid-single-digit growth in overall upgrade. There will be some volatility quarter to quarter as that works through. As we come into April, there'll be some pent-up demand, mostly from the Verizon Value Guarantee.\nCustomers really like that, so they're going to take advantage of that. But overall, for the year, we still think mid-single-digit growth for upgrades holds. Tony?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, sure. And good morning, Jim. So on the customer payment trends, look, Hans said this in the prepared remarks. The business is very resilient, and the demand and priority for connectivity is still high. And the payment trends we see are still very stable in both consumer and business, and very much at normal historical levels. The agings and the quality of the receivables continue to be very strong. And the bad debt we see, and as you know, we have a very high-quality customer base. And the bad debt that we do see trends with volume growth, and you see the gross adds growth. But as always, we're going to continue to monitor the trends very closely, but no change in trends there.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nAnd then on the Verizon Business Group's performance, I think that they are now into year-over-year improvements. And the focus for Kyle and the team together with Tony is to continue to drive year-over-year improvements. That can be a little bit up and down, but definitely the focus and the target is clear for us: continue to grow our Verizon Business bottom line. And they are proving it in two quarters right now. So we are pleased with what we're seeing right now.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, great. Thanks, Jim. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks, and good morning. So as you're looking to still target better consumer phone net adds in 2025 over 2024, can you give us an update on how you're seeing postpaid phone industry growth, the volumes you're expecting for the year, and how important that is relative to your target for your own volume? And then within that, are you seeing any impacts from changes in immigration policy? And do you have a better sense of how to frame the potential sensitivities to the forward operating prospects? And then just one more, if I could. You mentioned some impact from the federal government on business postpaid phone net adds. I'm just curious if there's additional impacts that you could see as you move through this year, whether it's on the wireless side or on the business wireline side. Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nLet me start. I mean, first of all, I mean, I let Sampath comment on the postpaid market. But I would say on the inflation, we don't have any impacts of that, and that's not something that we have seen anything from. When it comes to the federal government, what we comment on in the quarter was wireless, where we had a little bit of reductions in wireless as we saw some impact of the new government and their efficiency work. But all in all, all other things in wireless when it comes to large enterprises and SMBs, very strong and continue to take share. I mean, I'm not sure how many quarters we have now with Kyle and team taking share and continue to grow the wireless portfolio. So I'm pleased with what I see. So that's where it is.\nBut Sampath, talk about the postpaid market, business, and consumer?\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nLook, earlier in the year, we had estimated that the market is likely to grow between eight and 8.5 million postpaid phones, both for the consumer and the business segment. Sitting where we are right now, we think that number holds. But remember that more than 50% of that is pre- to postpaid migration, i.e., customers who are on prepaid plans migrating to postpaid. This is not a segment Verizon typically plays in directly. We play it through our partners, but directly, we do not play in this space there. So that segment could have some impact, but very little impact to Verizon. The second is on the prepaid side. Migration could impact the lower end of prepaid. That's also not a segment where Verizon has a high level of participation in that segment.\nSo on prepaid, despite lower immigration last three quarters, we're actually seeing our best performance in a very long time. We're gaining on the higher end of prepaid, which is why we are seeing strong performance despite low immigration in those segments.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mr. Petti's line has disappeared. We'll go ahead and move on to Mr. Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Two, if I may, I'm asking in light of your churn experience over the last two years. Does the market's ARPU expectation need to adapt to a less aggressive pricing growth trajectory? Are you feeling too much pressure from whatever the expectations are about pricing to serve all your needs? And then secondly, on FWA, I'm wondering when that multi-year expansion plan might begin to pressure either or both of CapEx or tower rental costs as some of your 5G cells become more utilized. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nI can start with the second question on Fixed Wireless Access. I'm not sure 100% understood it. But what we see in Fixed Wireless Access is exactly what I articulated in the second half of 2024. That is when we now start deploying C-Band in the suburban markets. Our OFS is a little bit smaller. And remember, our priority is mobility first when we roll out C-Band. So that means that the potential open for sale is a little bit smaller. And we said that's going to happen in the first half of the year. What we're doing to add to that is, of course, number one, the MDU solution that we now have launched in more than 15 markets will start ramping during the year, and that will help us to have more. And then, of course, we're going to bring out the C-Band more widely.\nOur plan is to go to 80% to 90% this year. So that's going to increase. And then we have our Fios, which last year was roughly 450,000 OFS. We're ramping up to 650. That will help us to continue. So there's no slowdown in speed or appetite or interest from customers. It's just technically how the rollout is working with FIxed Wireless Access. So again, we're super happy with the product, and we think that we have the two superior products in the market with Fios and Fixed Wireless Access, and we have the most covered broadband supplier in the market. So very excited over that and continue with that. I will leave the question to Sampath around the business. I didn't really get it.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, Hans, if I could just briefly follow up before we get to pricing. The purpose of my question was a bit more focused on your multi-year guidance as opposed to your 2025 execution. I think we can all agree that in certain locations, you're going to experience more highly utilized cells over time as you achieve your success in FWA. And I'm wondering, what year should we expect to see some pressure on CapEx as a result of that, given the desire to achieve a lot of FWA growth?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo in the multi-year plan, we have to 2028. There's no pressure. That's part of our normal rollout. And as always, Joe and the network team, they're always building more capacity as needed. So there's no particular pressure in the multi-year plan where it's said to reach eight to nine million subscribers. That's going to be managed with the BAU rollout of C-Band.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. Helpful.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Peter, for the question. Look, I don't want to say this is not the time to discuss future pricing. So what I will talk about more is wireless service revenue and how we think about it in the medium term. As far as the Verizon Value Guarantee, it was contemplated in 2025 guidance. But let me talk about some of the puts and takes that we have in our wireless revenue. The first is higher volumes. We'll have higher volumes in 2025 compared to 2024, and that'll help with wireless service revenue. Second is only 50% of our base is on myPlan. With the Verizon Value Guarantee, there are more incentives for customers to migrate to myPlan, which tends to be a kicker to revenue immediately. Longer term, look, we have step-ups.\nThere's a lot of value in our ultimate high-end plan, including an upgrade to unlimited hotspot, which we did last week, and it's really helping with the premium mix. Perks is another area that will continue to grow. We had said that we'll get to 14 million perks by the end of this year. I'm happy to say that I think we have line of sight to 15 million perks, an increase of a million perks by the time the year ends. FWA, look, that's a place for good, strong service revenue growth, both on volume, but also on ARPU with a much higher premium mix that we had planned. Value or a prepaid business historically has been a drag on our service revenue. In 2024, it was a 0.8% drag on our overall service revenue.\nWe expect that to turn positive in the second half as volumes grow nicely, and that'll help with long-term service revenue growth. The last is our wholesale business. It has healthy service revenue growth margin in it. So those are all the different levers that we have at our disposal to drive long-term wireless service revenue growth, and we are very comfortable with sustained growth in our business.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Peter. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We're going back to Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you for getting me back in the queue. Just one quick question just on EBITDA in the Q1 here and how we should be thinking about that. Obviously, EBITDA on the SG&A side and consumer was, yeah, I wouldn't necessarily say depressed, but was there any perhaps savings or pullback in spend related to SG&A that will resurface or be a bit more aggressive in Q2 and beyond as we think about the price guarantee and getting some, I guess, advertising, sales, and marketing push behind that? So that's a quick just housekeeping question. And then as you're thinking about the company's broader multi-year convergence strategy, obviously, there is some fiber available in the market as well as others looking for potential partners.\nBut if you step back, how do you think about perhaps, or does it make sense to either partner with additional fiber providers to accelerate the fiber to the home or your fiber locations push, or does it perhaps make sense to accelerate your fiber footprint build engine somewhat at the expense of leverage and free cash flow in the interim ahead of the Frontier deal close? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. I think I can start with the fiber, and I will leave it to Tony to talk about the beat and the cost savings. On the fiber, we're already ramping up right now our fiber deployment, and that's contemplated in our CapEx from 450 OFS to 650. So that's ongoing. Our focus right now is, of course, to close Frontier. And when we have Frontier closed, we have said initially, as we didn't have all the data, that plus 1 million OFS a year should be what we're targeting. And plus means plus. We haven't defined in that we need to get closer to the closing to give you an update, and we will do that. So we're very focused on that and see that we're doing the right thing.\nThen on convergence, the only thing I would say, first of all, I think we have own economics on everything in broadband and mobility, which means that we have a great position on convergence. A big portion, I would say the majority, and maybe Sampath can comment on it, if you take the majority of all the customers coming in on broadband this quarter, they are converged. So it's actually working for us. So maybe, Sampath, you can comment on that first, and then we go to Tony on the EBITDA.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nHans, you know, we saw 339,000 broadband net adds both for the business and consumer side spread over FWA and Fios. And the vast majority of them were in a converged offering, a.k.a. they had mobility and broadband together with us. And we're still holding on our plan that every time you combine the two, we tend to see a 50% reduction in mobility churn when we have fiber and a reduction in mobility churn when we have FWA as well. So the pay volumes have been very strong. But second is our converged posture is improving every single day as that happens. And that helps with long-term churn, but also proves the Verizon model of convergence, which tends to be very demand-led. It's based on a strong offering and giving customers what they want, which is flexibility, not just using price and promotions to get a converged offering.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Hey, Sebastiano, and your question on EBITDA, look, we started out the gate very strong with 4% growth, and we were very disciplined in our approach. We didn't chase volumes in the first quarters. We knew we had the Verizon Value Guarantee launching in early April, so we stayed very disciplined there. And we launched it from a position of financial strength, and that was very important. If you look across the margin profiles, there's the team sports, so whether it's consumer or business, we guide at the consolidated level. And we also had very strong cash flow in the quarter as well. And I'm proud of the cash flow result, having $900 million of free cash flow improvement and a lot of that coming on the operating cash flow side. So we're very confident in the EBITDA growth and the start to the year.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Great, Sebastiano. Thanks. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead, sir.",
    "content2": "Craig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, good morning. You just talked about what my previous question was going to be about convergence. So let me shift a little bit to, there's a lot of talk and expectation about a renegotiation of your MVNO agreement with the cable operators. Can you just talk about that a little bit as to how the relationship with the cable operators as customers has been evolving, and what you expect to happen with the renegotiation this year? Maybe just conceptually, do you think of the cable operators as part of your convergence solution in the sense that they are offering Verizon Wireless service themselves, or do you think of them as a convergence competitor?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Craig. You know that we cannot deep dive in our MVNO relationship, but I will try to do my best here. Number one, our strategy is to build a network once and have as many profitable connections on top of it. That's also where our MVNO partners are playing a role. I would say we have a very good relationship with our MVNO partners, and as in any business-to-business relationship. So we continue to have a good conversation with them and offering them service on the best network in the United States. So that's the only thing I can say, but this is an accretive business for us that is important in our overall strategy. And hopefully, our partners and our customers on the MVNO side feel the same, but that's at least what I believe.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nPerfect.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Craig. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Starting with fiber once again, just to get a sense of the framework they're using, the 35 to 40 million number in terms of a goal post, what does that mean? Is it the right number? Why not bigger? Irrespective of whatever multi-year guidance statement you take. And secondly, there's some spectrum bands that may come up for auction this year and maybe over the next couple of years as well. So it would be great to get an update in terms of your spectrum position and how you guys are thinking about some of the bands coming up this year and beyond. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Kannan. I hope that you're not using a Verizon line because it was a little bit wobbly. Anyhow, I think I heard your question. The first one was around the long-term plan of 35 to 40 million fiber coverings. Yeah, that's the long-term plan we have. Again, we did that communication when we just had made the offer to acquire Frontier. We are, of course, in the planning stage right now and, of course, working through the regulatory approvals. As soon as we get more clarity and closer to the closing of Frontier, we will do more updates where we are and timing, etc. Secondly, I would say everything with the Frontier transaction is going as planned. Our plan is to close it in Q1, so that is going according to plan.\nBut we are in the planning stage right now as we have not that acquired entity in our hands. But as soon as we are closing in on that, we will have more updates where we are. But that was a long-term number we gave when we made the acquisition. When it comes to spectrum, I think, first of all, we have a really good position on spectrum. I think the C-band and the millimeter wave positions that we have are really yielding. And we have talked about it on previous calls that when we deploy C-band, we have lower churn, better step-ups. We're creating Fixed Wireless Access opportunities. So it is really making a difference for us. So the second-hand market of spectrum is always coming in and out. We always do an evaluation if it makes sense for us to buy it.\nIt's a buy versus build, but I don't see any major second-hand market spectrum coming up. I think it's more important long-term for the US government, for the competitiveness of the US to actually bring out spectrum over time in order for the carriers to continue to grow. And I think that we all are aligned at that in the industry. It's going to be important. But if that's not a short-term issue, not even medium for us, but over the long term, US needs to come out with spectrum to continue to compete, especially with 5G Advanced and 6G coming later on.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Kannan. Brad Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sam McHugh of BNP. Your line is open.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director and Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP\n\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Just two quick ones. On the tariffs, you sounded pretty relaxed, and so I was just wondering why you added the caveat to the guidance. Where could we see an impact from tariffs potentially? Part one. And the second question on broadband, obviously, there's a lot of talk about kind of market weakness in wireless. What are you seeing in broadband? Do you think there's, are you seeing higher churn? Is that why subs are a bit weaker, or is it more of a growth out of market growth issue? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the tariffs, I mean, I don't think anybody's relaxed on tariffs given the volatility of where tariffs are going. I just conclude that if I take the midpoint or our $18 billion guide on capital expenditures this year, it's a very small portion that is exposed for tariffs. We are a US-based company investing in the US. Fiber is US-centric. Everything we do with labor products is fiber-based. Wireless equipment, of course, we're importing, but here we are but a smaller portion of the total $18 billion. That's why I'm saying that this we're going to handle. We have handled it before with our strategic suppliers, and I don't see that we will not handle it this time. So that's why I'm talking about that. Then what I said on handsets still remains.\nIf we're going to see those types of increases on handsets that we've heard, we are not planning to absorb those. I mean, that needs to be passed on to the customers. That's the only way to do it because that's so much money. And then on the broadband, we continue to see very good performance on broadband. The Fios, I think, is just doing great. The churn is extremely low. On the Fixed Wireless Access, we have good gross adds because it's a very attractive product from MPS. And then what we see is, of course, our churn that is higher than on Fios because it's an early product. It's in early stages compared to Fios that has been around for 25 years or at least 20+, 22, Tony tells me. But we're seeing now improvements by quarter by quarter, so we're doing that as well.\nMaybe Sampath can add something about what we see on the usage and the step-ups.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. What we're seeing is, look at the normal market on broadband. It is competitive. But what's interesting for us is because of our segmentation approach on FWA and Fios, where on FWA we lead with value for money, we lead with convenience, and on Fios we lead with just incredible reliability and performance, that segmentation strategy is working well, and we are growing on both sides. That's why we had a very strong quarter at 339,000 broadband net adds for both consumer and business. On churn, Fios had its best churn in a very, very long time this quarter. And it goes back to the strong NPS, customer satisfaction, and reliability of the fiber plant. On FWA, we are seeing sequential improvement in churn, which is really important for us as the product matures and we get more comfortable and customers get more comfortable with the piece.\nIn terms of ARPU, we are seeing good ARPU growth across both Fios and our FWA product. Two things are happening. One is we're getting better price realization. Two is a better premium mix in terms of higher-end plans on FWA and 1 gig plus plan on Fios. A combination of those two is giving us good ARPU growth in the space. So overall, it's a really good market for us. We are doing extremely well. We are taking share every single quarter in the market. We are growing on volume, and we are growing on price. And that's the perfect thing to build a long-term sustainable business in the broadband space.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director and Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Sam. Brad, we have time for one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe final question for today will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Thank you. I had two if I could. First is a follow-up question on the March and April gross adds strength. I think early in Q1, industry volumes were pretty soft. So just wondering if part of the March and April strength has been from a pickup in those industry volumes or if it's more market share take driven by your new offers. And then the second question I had relates to your MDU solution for Fixed Wireless. I was wondering if you could, excuse me, talk about the breadth of that launch, maybe comment on what some of the markets are that you've launched in, how available the product is in those markets, any comment on homes available. And then also, how is the product performing? What kinds of speeds and reliability are you seeing?\nAnd then lastly, can you talk about what's involved in expanding that services availability from here? What are the sort of gating factors to doing that? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the first question about the momentum we're seeing in March and April, and I think what we see, that's because of our offerings. I mean, I don't see anything else if the industry is coming back or not. I think this is related to us, how we perform. And remember, this is a plan that Sampath and his team together with our CMO have had for a long time to take the next step with our offering. And it resonates with our customers because, I mean, whatever we have learned from our customers is that they want the control or the predictability about the offerings. They want the simplicity of the offers, and they want the value. And we're hitting on all three of them. So I think that maybe Sampath can comment after this, but I can talk about MDU. Yeah.\nSo we have launched the MDU solution in more than 15 markets. Of course, in the beginning, you start with certain high rises. And this is, of course, sort of a Fios work. You need to see that the landlords in every house are accepting our solution, and then you can sell it into the whole household. So of course, we're working in parallel with a technical solution as well as seeing that we are opening up more and more MDUs. And that is going to roll out over the year. And it's both for the business side, but I would say mainly for the consumer side, this is opening up. We have different types of solutions on technology, both on sort of Fios-like performance down to Fixed Wireless Access performance.\nAnd that's how we're going to work it because ultimately, we want to give choice for our customers for different types of speed tiers as we did the Fixed Wireless Access, etc. So this is going to ramp over the year, and we just came out. So we feel good about the solution and the technology, and this is just adding opportunity for us to grow our broadband. But maybe Sampath, you can add something.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Look, March and April, March was mid-single digit growth in gross adds. April, we saw double digit growth, largely on the back of our Verizon Value Guarantee. It's resonating really well with customers. It's very easy to explain. Our sales team is doing an incredible job of explaining it to customers. And then lastly is impact on the base because to get the Verizon Value Guarantee, the base has to do absolutely nothing. They all get locked in for three years of the price guarantee, and they like that. And hence, it's driving add-aligned opportunity for us as well in the space. What we are seeing is good performance on our prepaid side of our business. That's a base that's been incredibly strong in the Q1. We're likely taking share in prepaid, and we are seeing good performance across all our core brands.\nTotal Visible and Straight Talk were probably the brands that had the strongest performance. It's the same playbook that we had in postpaid. We are rolling out that same playbook in prepaid, which is execution, better distribution, disciplined financials, and just getting to better outcomes than that. Lastly is our portfolio of brands. We are in a very unique position where we have a brand in every segment of the market and, more importantly, a leading brand in every segment of the market. So irrespective of how the economy moves and what level of economic uncertainty there is, we'll always have a place and a place for the customer to go through. So that gives us comfort. That little bit commentary about the March and April performance. Hans?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Maybe before we end up, I mean, people usually ask me what questions have we not answered. I think we haven't gotten any questions on our prepaid business. I would say this is Verizon at its best in execution, taking it from where it was. The whole team with Sampath has turned this around with branding, segmenting the market, and basically all our brands are growing at the moment in prepaid. I think that we're going to see that going forward. I'm really excited. This was the right decision for Verizon, the TracFone. Now we can be in all segments of the market with wireless, and that's where we should be as a leader and number one in this market. So that was answering a question I didn't get.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nOkay. Hey, Brad.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks to you both.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Bryan. Thanks for asking that at the end. Brad, I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."

To ask a question, press star one on your touch-tone phone. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star two. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our Q4 2024 Earnings Call and AI Update. I'm Brady Connor, and on the call with me this morning are Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Tony Skiadas, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have our Business Group CEO, Kyle Malady, who will be giving an update on our AI strategy, as well as our Consumer Group CEO, Sampath, who will also be joining us for Q&A. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found at the start of the investor presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.\nDiscussions of factors that may affect future results are contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, a detailed overview of our Q4 and full year results was posted to our Investor Relations website. We will also be posting supplemental materials relating to today's call on our website shortly. With that, I'll turn it over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone. I will begin by addressing the wildfires and the devastation that the Los Angeles area has experienced in recent weeks. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted. At Verizon, we always run through a crisis, and this time is no different. Our teams are working hard to protect and restore service to affected areas, support first responders, and help neighbors safeguard themselves.\nThe Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team is closely coordinating with federal, state, and local public safety agencies as they continue wildfire response and mitigation efforts. Verizon's network is holding up strong, maintaining critical connectivity for the community, businesses, and first responders. Our engineers have been working around the clock restoring nearly all of the macro sites that were impacted, and we will continue to be here for our employees, customers, and communities in LA.\nNow, let me turn to earnings. We had a successful year with great financial and operational results. We delivered on our financial guidance with 3.1% wireless service revenue growth and 2.1% Adjusted EBITDA growth, both exceeding the midpoint of our guided ranges. We generated strong free cash flow while absorbing higher taxes. We added nearly two and a half million postpaid mobility and broadband subscribers in the year while expanding our margins.\nWe ended the year with an industry-leading quarter wireless service revenue of $20 billion. In mobility, postpaid phone net adds were nearly 900,000 for the year. Consumer postpaid phone net adds were positive with and without the impact of our second number offering, and business postpaid phone net adds exceeded half a million. Prepaid net adds, excluding SafeLink, were positive for the year and for the first time since the TracFone acquisition.\nThis has been a great turnaround by the consumer team. On broadband, we added nearly 1.6 million subscribers and grew market share in 2024. Led by continued success of fixed wireless access, we ended the year with over 12.3 million broadband subscribers, including nearly 4.6 million fixed wireless access subscribers and over $2.1 billion on fixed wireless access revenue. We're off to a great start to hit our next milestone of eight to nine million fixed wireless access subscribers by 2028.\nWe continue to scale private networks, winning work with Xerox, Cummins Inc, FIFA, and more recently, the US Air Force. We were the only US carrier to be named a leader in the first-ever Gartner Magic Quadrant for private wireless services. Gartner recognized us for our vision, the work we have done to build the market, and our industry-leading execution. We drove efficiencies and continued the business transformation.\nWe ended the year with less than 100,000 employees, down close to 20,000 over the last three years. Continued business transformation gave us more flexibility to execute on our strategy and capital allocation priorities. We continued to invest in the business and made strategic moves for long-term growth. We launched customer-first offerings such as My Home and Verizon Access, refreshed our brand, and signed strategic transactions including Frontier, the Tower Deal, UScellular Spectrum, and satellite partnerships.\nWe raised the dividend for the 18th consecutive year and continued debt paydown, ending the year with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times. We have a great year with both customer and financial growth as we continue the strategic transformation of the company. Looking forward to 2025, we will continue to focus on our three key financial metrics: wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. While Tony will provide these details, I would highlight the underlying wireless service revenue growth is expected to be nearly double the guided range when excluding promo amortization. With that, I will turn it over to Tony to say a few words about the quarter and cover the guidance for 2025.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As we reported earlier this morning, we closed the year with strong operational and financial performance. The steps we took in 2024 to improve our execution while maintaining financial discipline continued to bear fruit. We added nearly one million postpaid subscribers onto our mobile and broadband platforms in the Q4, our highest quarterly result in over a decade, while also delivering on our financial guidance for the full year. We delivered solid growth in postpaid mobility with 568,000 postpaid phone net adds in the Q4. This includes 426,000 consumer postpaid phone net adds, giving us positive net adds for the full year with and without our second number offering. Business had another solid quarter with 142,000 phone net adds and saw strong growth across all three customer groups.\nThe operational rigor we implemented in prepaid continued to pay off in the Q4. Prepaid net adds were 65,000, excluding SafeLink, giving us positive net adds for the full year. In broadband, we continued to take market share, delivering 408,000 net adds in the quarter. Fixed wireless access accounted for 373,000 net adds, and Fios added 51,000 subscribers in the quarter, a solid result given the challenges noted by some of our competitors.\nImportantly, we achieved these strong operational results while delivering on all of our 2024 financial guidance. In fact, both wireless service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were above the midpoint of our guided ranges, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points for the full year. In the Q4, we delivered 3.1% wireless service revenue growth, along with 2.1% growth in Adjusted EBITDA as we balanced investing in customer growth with maintaining financial discipline.\nFinally, our free cash flow of $5.4 billion in the quarter and $19.8 billion for the full year allowed us to take meaningful steps to further reduce our debt, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and to better position us for the closing of our pending acquisition of Frontier. Note that our Q4 free cash flow included approximately $2 billion in proceeds from the Vertical Bridge tower transaction. In addition, we made severance payments of approximately $600 million, which represents roughly half of the total payments we expect to make as part of our voluntary separation program. Turning to guidance, we entered 2025 with good operational and financial momentum, and that is reflected in our outlook. We expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 2.8%.\nThe key drivers of this outlook are consistent with 2024 and include improving postpaid consumer phone net additions and continued healthy business phone volumes, pricing actions taken in 2024 that carry over into 2025, continuing to scale fixed wireless access, growing adoption of My Plan and accompanying perks, and an improving prepaid revenue profile. As we head into the fall, we expect promo amortization headwinds to peak in 2025. That said, the underlying customer economics are very healthy.\nPlease note that beginning in Q1 2025, we are reclassifying more than $2.9 billion of annual recurring device protection and insurance-related plan revenues from other revenue into wireless service revenue. As a result, our wireless service revenue guidance should be viewed in the context of growth off of a higher base of revenue. We expect consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3.5% compared to 2024.\nThis outlook reflects the expected higher wireless service revenue and benefits of ongoing cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in business wireline revenues. The midpoint of the Adjusted EBITDA guidance range reflects an expected year-over-year increase of more than $1.3 billion, which is $300 million more of expected growth than we delivered in 2024. Full-year adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be in a range of flat to up 3%, reflecting the Adjusted EBITDA growth, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization. As we discussed in October, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17.5 and 18.5 billion. This guidance is an all-in number that includes all of our growth initiatives.\nThis includes incremental investments to deploy C-Band to 80% to 90% of plant sites, accelerating our Fios expansion to up to 650,000 new open-for-sale locations, and launching our fixed wireless MDU solution. As always, we will continue to look for opportunities to efficiently deploy capital. Regarding cash flow, we expect free cash flow in the range of $17.5 to 18.5 billion in 2025. This outlook assumes mid-single-digit growth and upgrades and no change to current tax legislation. Please note that our guidance excludes any impacts on the pending acquisition of Frontier. We are currently working with all regulatory bodies that must approve the transaction. The process is going as planned, and we continue to expect the transaction to close by early 2026. I will now turn the call back over to Hans to go over his 2025 priorities.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Tony. Looking ahead, our 2025 priorities are clear: a continued focus on wireless service revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA expansion, and strong Free Cash Flow. Accelerate the mobility momentum and broadband growth while scaling private networks as we expand 5G Ultra Wideband and 5G reach. Laser focus on operational excellence, financial discipline, and customer experience to drive customer and financial growth.\nExecution of our capital allocation model, investing in the business, supporting and growing our dividend, paying down debt, and eventually share repurchases. And we will leverage our fiber and edge compute assets to open new revenue streams from the AI ecosystem. So let me talk about Verizon's AI strategy now. We have worked with AI for many, many years, and we already today have several generative AI products at scale in our company. We outlined a three-pronged strategy for AI at Verizon.\nLet me go through them briefly. Number one, enhance experiences and drive efficiencies. This is all about employee and customer experiences, driving down costs in our operations. A good example would be Fast Pass, which I've talked about before, which is deployed in our mobility call centers to intelligently pair customers with the best available care representative. The second part of the AI strategy at Verizon is to personalize product and solutions. This is much more about how we can be more personalizing the service for our customers. A great product here would be Segment of Me, which is a tool that uses AI to personalize customer experience with unique offers and products.\nThe third pillar of the AI at Verizon strategy, which we haven't talked so much about, but I have promised you several times to come back to it, and that we will talk about today, is connect to the AI ecosystem. That's the focus of today. If you think about where we are on generative AI today, today it's large language models that are trained at large data centers and that requires enormous capacities. Over time, that will, of course, come much closer to the edge of the network, both for application, but transport cost and latency in some cases. This is creating an opportunity for us and has already created an opportunity as we had revenue and EBITDA impact in the Q4.\nWe're now looking into how we can use our assets and our capability to serve this market when it comes to the next step of generative AI. So I'm very proud and excited to introduce Verizon AI Connect today. That's our product and solution to address this market and meeting the end customer's needs in the next step of AI, generative AI. So by that, I will hand it over to Kyle that will talk about and discuss our opportunities and how we're addressing this market.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans. It's a pleasure to be here this morning. You know, Verizon AI Connect is the name of our strategy and suite of offerings that are intended to meet the growing demand for AI applications from both our ecosystem partners and end user customers. It's a vision that allows us to utilize existing assets in new ways to service this technology revolution.\nWhether the AI workloads are across a multi-cloud environment deployed on our customer's premise or at the edge of the networks, we have a suite of offerings that businesses can utilize to fully leverage AI capabilities. Our vision is built around best-in-class connectivity and edge compute assets. It all starts with connectivity. Over the last 20 years, we have built unmatched fiber assets, not only in our ILEC footprint via Fios, but also outside through our 71-city One Fiber buildup.\nTogether with our industry-leading long-haul network that stitches these metros together, we can provide lit and dark fiber services to our customers over a large geographic area. We have edge-to-cloud connectivity and expertise, and we are ahead of the curve in this area. The investments we have made in our converged intelligent edge network over the last several years will pay dividends in this new world as users need even more bandwidth and network visibility. Our network is intelligent and programmable. Customers want to control where and when AI workloads are running. And to that, we are building new capabilities to give users more insight and control via new tools. Essentially, we are allowing them to program their network resources to optimize their operation as they see fit. And finally, edge compute.\nAs AI shifts from training to deep deployment, the need for distributed computing will become increasingly important for real-time decisions and predictions. We have thousands of distributed telco facilities, many of which already have power space and cooling available for this compute at the edge. As we take stock of our existing assets, Verizon's ability to be a foundational player in the AI ecosystem is clear. The technical infrastructure required to enable AI is evolving. AI demands massive amounts of data, powerful chipsets, and high-speed, secure, flexible network connectivity. Market analysts estimate there will be over $1 trillion of investment in AI infrastructure over the next 10 years, and some suggest AI network traffic will grow at 35% plus CAGR over the next five years. Enormous investments have been announced, and we expect more to come.\nAll of this AI infrastructure will need to be underpinned by secure network connectivity that will bridge the new distributed compute landscape. At Verizon, we see ourselves as not just participants in this AI-driven future, but as a key player enabling its success. Verizon's leadership in the enterprise connectivity market is poised to become even more crucial as AI applications become more widespread among end users. We believe Verizon will serve as the essential link between these Gen AI applications and the firms who utilize them.\nWith a growing network of over 16,000 near-net enterprise locations, Verizon is positioned at the forefront of the AI deployment, providing the connectivity solutions that will enable the seamless integration of AI applications across a wide range of industries and sectors. We also have extensive connectivity of third-party data centers currently ranking a close third in the market.\nData centers will continue to be crucial in this new AI-powered world, and 40% of data centers are expected to face operational constraints by 2027, which is another factor in workloads moving to the edge. Verizon's extensive fiber and programmable networks are ready to meet these demands across key markets. We're not alone in recognizing the opportunity. Industry analysts are seeing and predicting further significant growth in the AI market.\nHyperscalers are expanding into new markets, and they need high-capacity connectivity. The industry is seeing a surge in cloud migration and colocation demand. Lastly, power, space, and cooling are the currencies that are in demand right now, and we have all three. As we look across our assets, take inventory, and compare against other players in the market, we believe that we are in a leadership position when it comes to usable power and space.\nWe have facilities across the United States that either have spare power, space, and cooling, or can be retrofitted. As we sit here today, we have two to 10 plus mega watts of usable power across many of our sites. Also, as we move through our network transformation work, we will continue to free up more resources that could be made available for AI Connect.\nIn addition, we have between 100 and 200 acres of undeveloped land, some currently zoned for data center build, and much of it in prime data center-friendly areas. This is not a theoretical discussion. We are seeing increasing demand for our AI Connect offerings. We already have a funnel of over $1 billion simply leveraging our existing infrastructure. Major players such as Google and Meta have purchased capacity on our network with the intent of using it for their AI workloads.\nSome of these deals are reflected in our Q4 results and are contributing to the margin improvements you saw in the quarter. We are working closely with industry players like NVIDIA to reimagine how telco functions can work along with AI workloads. We are starting this development at the far edge in a private network. The applicability will go beyond that and potentially into the macro network at some point. I'm also happy to report that we have a new strategic partnership with Vultr, a leading global GPU-as-a-service provider and cloud computing provider. Initially, Vultr will deploy their GPU-as-a-service infrastructure in one of our data centers and tap into our high-capacity fiber network for distribution. We anticipate helping to broaden their reach and enable our mutual customers with AI training and inference capabilities at the edge over time.\nThe bottom line is we are ready to help power the AI ecosystem. We have the assets, the expertise, and the vision to deliver AI solutions at scale. By unlocking the potential of our existing assets, we can further improve the financial profile of Verizon Business. The team has worked hard over the last few years to help mitigate the impact of secular wireline revenue pressures. Together with continued strong results in mobility, FWA expansion, and work on cost efficiencies, Verizon AI Connect positions us for success into the future.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Kyle. I hope you now got more insights to how we see we can connect the AI ecosystem, both from the capability point of view and also from the assets we have, and that we already now have customers and solutions in the market. And this is just the beginning. I'm really excited over what we see right now as an opportunity for us in this area. Lastly, we had a great 2024, and I look forward to exciting opportunities and continued growth ahead. So by that, I hand it over to Brady to handle the Q&A.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Hans. Brady, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. Your name is required to introduce your question. If at any point your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your request, you may remove yourself by pressing star two. Once again, please press star one for questions. One moment for the first question. The first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe first starting off with Kyle's commentary on AI Connect, just any sense to in terms of the overall. I know I realize it's early and we're getting these announcements seemingly like weekly now, but any sense in how big this opportunity could be, both on the connectivity side or in terms of the space and power would be great. Just to frame it out for us. And then maybe more operationally, you guys showed some real momentum to end the year, both on the wireless side with gross ads up over 5% and then the broadband side. A, could you talk a little bit about the drivers of that momentum and have you seen that momentum continue as we started out 2025? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. Let me start with the second question and then we'll come back to the AI with Kyle. When it comes to momentum, both in broadband and wireless, both in the business group and in the consumer group, I think we have actually outlined quite a lot of changes in the structure, not only the people we have leading it, but also the products we have deployed, the rebranding we have done. And honestly, we see that our products are resonating. I mean, this is, as we said, you know, when it comes to what we're adding in new customers in Q4, best in a decade. So we're really, really, really excited over what we're seeing. And if you think about the broadband side, that's of course, Verizon Access is doing great.\nI mean, so we were together with Fios over 400,000 in the quarter, continue to take share. On the wireless, we're getting stronger and stronger now. We have several quarters of consecutive improvements. So I think it's a lot of execution, but also that the products are right, the branding are right, and then the network is just improving. I mean, you have seen our numbers from the network, wherever we deploy C-Band, better premium sales through opening fixed wireless access, and of course, seeing that lower churn. So all that comes together with an execution we've done over the last couple of years. I will ask actually Sampath to comment on that, and then I will ask Kyle to talk about the AI opportunity, which we think is great with our assets. But first, Sampath.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thank you, Hans. You know, in 2025, we expect higher phone net ads than in 2024. In Q4, we saw really strong momentum in our business. Look, we've had eight quarters of phone gross ad growth, and we see that momentum continuing into 2025. A couple of reasons why. The first one is our value prop is resonating very well. I think my plan, more than half our base is already on my plan, and that value prop is unique in the market because we give savings to customers that others just cannot be able to give. So that is working very well for us. The second is a lot of the work we did in 2023 and 2024 on sales execution, local markets, and local marketing is starting to pay off even well, and we see that continuing into 2025.\nThe last is there are some opportunity segments that we've tapped into, and Q4 was the start of that. The first one was tier one markets. We've historically had a slightly lower presence in tier one markets. That is shifting. Some of our large markets, we are starting to see share market gain in those segments. Second is the Latino segment. We've had a concerted effort last couple of quarters to go after that. So we are a financially disciplined operator. We saw growth, we saw opportunity in Q4, and we went for it.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nHey, John, thanks for the question on AI Connect. I mean, here's our best guess at the moment is the TAM we can sell into with what we have is probably $40 billion plus. But you see that every single day there's new announcements of hundreds of billions of dollars going into this ecosystem. And like I spoke about, we have a lot of assets that can play right into this. And frankly, we have well over $1 billion plus in funnel right now, and that's really only with our services that we have today. That's not even counting the power space and cooling stuff that I talked about. So I feel this is going to grow. Where it ends up, I think it's anybody's guess, but the investment going into here is massive, and we're going to be able to play right into it.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, John. Brady, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of CITI. Your line is open.\n\nMicheal Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks and good morning. I'm curious if you can provide a bit more context on the upgrade environment in terms of what you saw from customer behavior during Q4, and if you could share some additional context on the drivers behind your base case for upgrades that are embedded within the 2025 guidance. Then second, just in terms of financials, if you could just share some of the additional drivers that are contributing to the faster EBITDA growth guidance for 2025, as well as if you could share some of the bridge items between EBITDA guidance and Free Cash Flow guidance for 2025, including things like tax, and working capital.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOkay. Thank you, Mike. So when it comes to upgrades, I think that after many, many quarters of decline, we came to a slight growth on upgrades. So that's not strange after many quarters. You ultimately will get there. I think that we still have the same sort of facts behind it. I mean, customers on the consumer side keep the phones very long.\nI mean, now we're way over 40 months, and that's of course contributing to this. And as we spoke about earlier, what we have seen on upgrade cycles is of course very much driven on new technologies and new hardware design. So we haven't seen much of that lately. And of course, the products are way better and more resilient as well. So I think that's what you see. But I will also ask Sampath to make a couple of more comments on that.\nOn the EBITDA expansion, I mean, I will ask Tony to talk about it, but we have worked on the cost. I mean, the initiatives we have done all the way from voluntary separation program, the outsourcing we have done with HSC in Kyle's shop, the change we did in customer care. We have done a lot on the cost, and then of course we start getting growth, and then the model starts getting leveraged. You see that in our cash flow, you see it in our EBITDA. And remember, we're measured on three things: wireless service revenue growth, EBITDA, and cash flow expansion. We showed that in 2024. Our guidance for 2025 shows the same. So this team is super committed to it. But Sampath, something about the upgrade environment.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYes, Hans. Look, 2024 was our lowest upgrade rate in a very long time. In Q4, we saw some modest increase, 10 basis points, increased year on year. So we think 2024 was the bottom of our low upgrade rate, and we're going to start seeing gradual improvements in 2025. I think mid-single digits is what we've assumed in our plan and our guidance, and I think we're going to be quite comfortable with that.\nIt's driven by two very important things. The first is the life of the device. It's exceeded 40 months right now, and at some point, customers will want new devices. The second is customers coming off their three-year DPP contract. We have a large cohort in 2025 coming off. So a combination of those two gives us comfort that mid-single digit increase in upgrade is what we expect in 2025.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nOkay. Hey, good morning, Mike. Just on EBITDA, I'll start there. So in 2024, we grew EBITDA about $1 billion, and we also, as Hans said in the prepared remarks, grew subscribers 2.5 million between broadband and mobility, and that was above the midpoint of the range. In 2025, we said our range was 2% to 3.5% growth, which implies about $1.3 billion of growth at the midpoint of the guidance. It's an acceleration, as you mentioned, in the growth rate and good operating leverage. It starts with strong service revenue growth and healthy customer economics, and you heard Hans in the prepared remarks talk about the customer economics without the program amortization.\nThen Hans mentioned the focus on cost transformation and the work we continue to do to make the business more efficient, whether it's customer care and the work that Sampath is doing, including AI, and you heard that upfront, as well as the managed services work. Joe's taking a lot of legacy network elements out, and that work is ongoing. We also have the voluntary separation program, which took shape at the end of last year. We'll see a full year benefit this year.\nThe guide assumes, as you mentioned, a modest increase in upgrades year-over-year. But overall, we're very confident that we were able to absorb the impact of the program amortization and have EBITDA growth acceleration. You see the investments we're making, the strength of the network, and the execution, as Sampath mentioned, are positioning us for strong EBITDA performance.\nThen if I move to cash flow, as Hans mentioned, the cash flow generation of the business continues to be very strong. For the full year in 2024, we delivered $19.8 billion in free cash flow, and that's inclusive of the tower deal. There's about $2 billion there from the tower deal. The results in 2024 evidence, as Hans said earlier, that we can manage through significant pressures like cash taxes and still generate a very strong cash flow profile.\nWhen you look at this in the context of the guide, we said $17.5 to 18.5 billion on free cash flow. We still feel very good about the cash generation. That's an all-in range, and we're managing to that. The drivers, Mike, are very similar to what we saw in 2024. It starts with EBITDA growth, and I talked about the $1.3 billion at the midpoint.\nWe gave a range at CapEx of $17.5 to 18.5 billion for 2025. As always, our network engineers do a great job, and they're always going to be very efficient with our capital spending, and you saw that in 2024. Interest expense continues to improve. We paid down a significant amount of debt in 2024. We're down about $7 billion in total debt, so that will continue to see improvements there. On working capital, we continue to focus on driving efficiencies in working capital, and that goes beyond handsets as well. With cash taxes, really no change there. We'll continue to see pressure from bonus depreciation. We'll have to see what happens in Washington with any proposed legislation. The assumption we put in the free cash flow guide was that we'd see a mid-single digit year-over-year increase in upgrades.\nAnd obviously, Frontier, as we said earlier, is excluded from the guidance. But look, the guidance reflects the strong cash generation that we have in the business, and it allows us to continue our capital allocation priorities, whether it's investing in the business, committing to the dividend, and continue to deliver the balance sheet. And you'll see us continue to do that in 2025.\n\nMicheal Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Mike. Brady, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. Just in regards, just a quick housekeeping question, I guess, for Tony. The $2.9 billion of device protection and insurance in 2024, how should we think about the underlying growth rate within that revenue bucket that will be reclassified? Just trying to think about apples-to-apples service revenue guide. I mean, how has that been trending, I guess, relative over the last several years and maybe expectations for contribution next year within the context of the overall service revenue guide? Another quick question on fixed wireless. I think in Q3, Hans, we talked a little bit about perhaps the pace of FWA growth slowing a little bit, maybe because of greater contribution from suburban and rural as C-band is deployed in those markets. Strong Q4 number here.\nAnd also just kind of thinking about you will be standing up an MDU solution in 2025, which should aid the trajectory in the tier one markets. So maybe any help in thinking about how you expect the MDU solution to scale or the contribution maybe within, I would imagine, the 76 C-band markets. And then one last question. As you think about, I think, Sampath, you reiterated expectations for consumer phones to improve, and that adds to improved existing second line year-over-year. Great to hear. Lots of focus on additions growth. Maybe if you can kind of touch upon if there's any slowdown or beyond the normalization that we've been seeing across the ecosystem, is there any expectations for a pronounced slowdown in additions growth in 2025? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Sebastiano. Let me start. We will end by the insurance question, and Tony will take that one. On fixed wireless access, you're absolutely right. Our C-band deployment has a priority number one, mobility. And that means that our secondary business case on fixed wireless access, we go to tier two and tier three market right now that is less dense. The speed is the same. I mean, some in the market believe we're slowing down. We're not slowing down. You saw the numbers in the Q4. The guys are doing fantastic. But of course, a little bit less opportunities going into the first half of 2025, probably. But with the MDU solution also coming in and then ramping up Fios at the same time, we're going to see a continuation of our strength in broadband.\nWe took market share in 2024 in broadband, and I'm certain we're going to do it again with the fixed wireless access and the Fios we have. So it's going to be a great year again for fixed wireless access. And we come with new products. We improve all the time what we're delivering. I'm going to ask Sampath to talk a little bit about that and acquisition. But before we come to acquisition, I think that we have been managing fantastically with our portfolio to all the customer groups, even though what we see is a slower or less big switcher pool. We have an offering that's actually appealing to the market, and we can grow in that with the competition. So I feel confident whatever it might be moves in the market that we can continue.\nSo I will ask Sampath first to comment a little bit, and then Tony will answer on the insurance question.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nSebastiano, good morning to you. I think on FWA and broadband more general, our value prop is resonating really well with customers. My Home is working very well, and it's delivering what customers want. On one end, you have FWA, which attracts the premium service, attracts a premium client base. They like the ease and the convenience of use.\nOn the other end, you have fiber, which is highly reliable, very high performance. So we were able to segment the market very well, and that's why you're seeing continued success. We are taking more than 50% of all the industry net adds. 50% of all the growth is coming to us in the market. We're going to continue to see that in 2025 as well, as we've done in 2024. For the company, we're going to have between 350 and 400,000 broadband net adds a quarter.\nAs Hans said, there's going to be some fluctuation across the quarters as we do because we are scaling three very big things in this space. The first is rolling out C-Band in tier two, tier three markets. They have a slightly different density, and hence a different pace of sales as it works into it. The second is our MDU product for FWA. We've started it. We're going to see that scaling all into 2025. The third is our expansion of Fios to 650,000 household OFSs. All those three things will scale through the year, but we are very comfortable with our 350 to 400, assuming some fluctuations. Also, we are starting to see good ARPU increase. Customers are taking more of our premium plans, gig plans on the Fios side, and our premium plans on FWA.\nIt goes back to the resilience and the convenience of our service. On that note, let me kind of speak on behalf of the customers for the moment. For decades, most customers have had very limited choice when it comes to broadband providers. You tend to hear the same pain points over and over again. It's opaque pricing, poor reliability, and it drives low NPS. We are very clear. This is what customers want: an offering that delivers high performance and reliability, no gotcha pricing, no promotions that expire in 12 months, pricing that does not double in a year. They want choice. They want transparency. That is what we are delivering to them, and that's what customers like. So on that foundation, we are very comfortable with our pacing of 350 to 400,000 broadband net adds every single quarter.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nGood morning, Sebastiano. Just on the handset insurance, so just a couple of things here. So it's recurring handset protection revenue, and it's value that our customers receive. That's very complementary to connectivity. We are going to recast the historical revenue, so we'll provide them so you have a comparable view. The impact is about $2.9 billion in 2024. So the baseline of service revenue exiting 2024 is about $82 billion. The impact to growth rates is not significant, maybe five, 10 basis points, and there's obviously no change to the service and other category.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nOkay. Brady, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. One on wireless and one on AI, if I may. On the wireless service revenue, I think, Tony, you talked about the $2 billion step up roughly for this year, but the growth rate essentially underlying roughly doubling when accounting for the accounting change you're introducing. So does this sort of apply as we exit 2025 and go into 2026 that we're going to be able to kind of maintain that same level of pace in terms of absolute revenue dollar growth on service revenue?\nAnd then secondly, on the AI Connect, Kyle, thanks for the good detail, but can you maybe give us a sense of the billion-dollar pipeline of sales? When do you think we're going to see material revenue being actually recognized in the P&L, and what's the split roughly between the connectivity business and data centers long-term?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOkay. On the program amortization, I'm just going to reiterate what I said on my opening remarks. I mean, we guide right now from 2% to 2.8%. Our underlying growth is nearly double. And at the end of this year, that will start to fade off, basically, and have less impact going forward. So that's where we are right now. We're not guiding for 2026 at the moment, but we are in a good position.\nAnd the headwinds that we created for ourselves by investing heavily in 2022 and 2023, as you might remember, that was not our best years, is still impacting us. But given how the financial discipline and the work that Sampath has done, and even, of course, Kyle during the last 12 to 18 months, that will have an impact, a positive impact for us when we're going to get less of that pressure by year-end. And that's why I have to be very clear. I mean, what we see is really a growth of nearly double than what we're guiding for in real terms. But of course, as you do the accounting, you need to follow that. On the AI, I'm going to hand it over to Kyle.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question here, Jim. I think if you look at the funnel right now, it's basically entirely connectivity for hyperscalers, right? It's basically lit services, wave, and dark fiber. But that's why we're happy today to announce that we're going to add the power, space, and cooling to the portfolio as well. And I see over time that we'll certainly be selling the typical wave and dark fiber to players, but I think we'll also be selling bundles of stuff, right? So we'll put power, space, and cooling together with networking, and we're going to sell it on a basically project-by-project basis, right, and make sure that we maintain our good margins and all that kind of thing.\nIn terms of Rev Rec, we already booked revenue in this regard in Q4, and that was certainly helpful for me in our EBITDA trajectory. We intend to drive more of that to the bottom line going through 2025, and we look forward to driving more business here.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jim. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you guys about ARPU growth and sort of the competitive environment, and then I'm going to come back to Kyle on the AI topic. You guys had 4% plus consumer ARPU growth in Q4 and talked about expecting healthy growth in 2025. Can you just sort of talk a little bit about the competitive environment and sort of what gives you guys confidence in the ability to continue to take price selectively, and some of the drivers around ARPU growth that you see ahead for the consumer business? And then, Kyle, you mentioned you were just mentioning dark fiber a bit. We have seen some of your competitors announce some pretty big investments in adding capacity.\nI'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much of the AI opportunity is leveraging existing assets and to the extent you guys are investing within your CapEx guidance into this business. We'd be interested in sort of where those investments are targeted. Thanks so much.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo I will start on the competitive environment. I wouldn't say that there's anything new in the competitive environment. It's just that we are performing way better. I mean, I usually say that our way of competing is with the network, it's with the product and solutions, and it's with the services that we're competing and the brand. And if you look at last year, I mean, our network has just continued to improve. We're going to now go to C-Band up to 90%, which means that we have more to go there. I think on the product side, we have heard about My Home, My Plan, and what Kyle is doing. All of that is resonating. Our refresh of the brand, even though it's early, after six months, is really paying off as well.\nSo all that is really how we are competing way better in the market than before. But then I will ask Sampath to talk a little bit about the segments. We're doing good on the ARPU growth. On the dark fiber, I will hand that to Kyle. But in general, I would say that everything is included in our guide, and there is nothing more. Usually, I would say the majority we have is assets that we already have. But Mr. Sampath.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nHans, let me build on that. At the end of the day, it comes down to value prop for us. We've built a very strong value prop with a very strong brand on the foundation of our number one network, and that combination is what gives us confidence about ARPU. Let me use the opportunity to step back and talk about our broader service revenue options. We've always said we wanted to get to an 80/20 medium-term contribution from price and volume. It's important for a long-term sustainable business in a subscription category to be in that framework, and we are on our way to do that. 2024 was a good start for us because we saw positive volume contributions across all our businesses: mobility, FWA, and value, which has historically been negative for a few years for us.\nYou're going to continue to see volume growth in postpaid and the value and sustained momentum in broadband. So that takes care of the volume part of the equation. Second is on price, which is an important component. There are two types of pricing levers that we have. The first is price ups for more value that we provide to customers. We had four major price ups in 2024. We've had two in 2025 because we are delivering more value to our customers, and they feel very comfortable with the price structure that we have. We cannot, of course, comment on future price ups, but we will look where we see lower churn, where input prices are a little higher, and more importantly, the value that we deliver to customers. For 2025, the price actions that we've already done are in the hopper.\nMore than $1 billion plus of our service revenue growth is already baked in just with those price ups. You're going to see, of course, pressure and help from the volume side. The second is customers are stepping up. It's a bigger opportunity for us as they buy more perks because we give them savings that they don't get anywhere else. They're taking more premium plans, especially as C-Band gets rolled out. So you're also starting to see a little bit of tailwind from that. Lastly, there are other ways to monetize the network that we've started exploring aggressively. The first one is network slicing. In Q4 2024, we launched our first network slice, and you're going to see us do more of that. The second is enhanced satellite connectivity.\nWe have best-in-class partnerships with Apple and Skylo, and as that scales out, you're going to start seeing more monetization in the piece. So we have upside on network monetization as well. So a combination of all of these gives us a lot of comfort of good ARPU growth in 2025. The market is competitive, but look, we like our playbook a lot, and I think it's hunting very well, and you'll see us execute on that similar to how we executed in 2024.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd on the AI bit,\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nI appreciate the question, Ben. So I think, yeah, some of our competitors are doing investments now, but what our game plan is here is to leverage the investments we've made over time. And as MPLS, the secular decline continues to go down there, we can reimagine the assets we have. And to Hans' point, so most of the things that we're going to be using to get into this market are things we've already done. So it's the assets we already have, tweaked a little bit. And we do have the CapEx in there because, listen, some of these deals, what we'll have to do is spend some capital to edge out our fiber a little bit to go meet people at the right data centers and/or locations of business, and then retrofitting technical space.\nSo we have money in for that, but we're ready to go with that. It's all included in the envelope. So we're just really leveraging all the work we've done over the last decade with One Fiber, Fios, IEN, and all those assets that we have. We're just going to leverage them and edge out and capture market here.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks a lot, guys.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ben. Brady, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess first, more of a housekeeping item for you, Tony. Now that we've pulled fees out of other in 2023, now we're pulling insurance out of other in 2025. What is other? And is it now more of a pure-play representation of the monetization of your cable relationship, perhaps? And then the second question is, obviously, in the new administration, I know you guys are well aware that everybody's now thinking about big deals. And one of the bigger deals people are talking about is, could Comcast and Charter come together? And I guess the question is, what would that mean? As we think about that possibility, how should we think about what it would mean for Verizon in terms of, are there changes of controls?\nWould this larger entity have more bargaining power with you the next time we have a conversation about pricing? How would it all work? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nLet Tony answer the first question, I think.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, sure. Good morning, Dave. So on the other, look, what's left is really USF and other fees and also the MVNO relationships that are in there. But all the other recurring revenues are up in service revenue.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo first of all, I cannot speculate on whatever combination you're seeing in front of you. But again, our MVNO relationships are very important to us. They're treated like large enterprises. I think we both are very satisfied with the relationship we have and what we have built together. And remember, our strategy is to build the network once and have as many profitable connections on top of the network. And this is a creative task, as we said before. So no, I cannot comment on any combinations that can happen. I think we're in a good position. We have the best network in the market. And I think that resonates with customers, and I think that's the most important.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Hans. If I could just do one more follow-up, Tony, is there a specific increment in cash taxes that you've baked in that you can share with us for the cash flow number?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nDave, we gave a guide this year, and I gave you the puts and takes. We're going to manage to that guide. We delivered on our guidance for 2024, and I expect us to continue to deliver on our guidance for 2025.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nBut it is a higher tax.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nIt is higher, yes, but we're not going to give these specifics.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nNo. But clearly, we managed that with all the other puts and takes. And if you took the midpoint of this, I mean, we are being equal or better than 2024 when we take away the tower deal. So as you understand, we feel confident, and that will help us with our capital priorities to continue to invest in business. We have increased our dividend for 18 consecutive years. We have paid down our debt. I mean, our team has done a great job. We're on 2.3 right now on the leverage, which is very close to the 2.25 when we're going to consider repurchasing our shares. So that will put me and the board in a very different situation when it comes to the optionality of doing repurchases when that happens.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nPerfect, guys. Thanks so much.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Dave. Brady, ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n[Analyst] (Raymond James)\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. This is Rob on for Frank. So you briefly touched on this earlier, but how would you assess the opportunity to expand Fios in your legacy footprint from here? Do you expect to build faster going forward? And as a follow-up, how attractive is the BEAD opportunity for you guys? Any updates you can share with us on how you're feeling about that would be great. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo on the Fios, we have been on the Fios more than 20 years. The product is resonating with our customers. As we outlined our broadband strategy at the end of last year or October or whatever, we said that we're now going to increase basically 50% in open for sale, going to 650,000 in this year. That's a scaling that is pretty easy for us. So we continue to scale. We see more opportunities for two reasons.\nFirst of all, the economic situation in the country is better today. I mean, purchasing power. Number two, broadband is a necessity. We have also found out that we can deploy fiber cheaper. We outlined all of these in our broadband strategy. So all that is playing in that we can keep our return on investment on this increase of Fios. So we feel good about the Fios.\nOn the BEAD, we will participate where it makes sense for us. We think that we will have a good opportunity to get a subsidy for building out in maybe rural areas, etc. So we're going to participate. It's so far fairly little that has been out there, because the states are sort of about doing it, but we will participate wherever we think it makes sense from a return on investment.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Great. Thanks, Rob. Brady, ready for the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sam McHugh of BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nHead of Telecom Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThanks, guys. Two questions. On the wireless service revenue, we always have a few puts and takes with the promo amort on the price ups. How should we think about the phasing of these headwinds and tailwinds through the course of 2025? Number one. And then secondly, on the business EBITDA, you mentioned some of the AI-related sales. Maybe you could elaborate on how material they are. And are we at a place now where we should be confident on this inflection point in business EBITDA? Can that be enough to support this? Thanks very much.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Good morning, Sam. So on the service revenue, we feel very good about the shape. It's based on $82 billion, as I said earlier. The midpoint of the guide implies, and Sam Path mentioned this earlier, about $2 billion of additional growth. We executed a number of pricing initiatives, as Sam Path mentioned, that carry into 2025. We also talked about an improving volume profile in consumer, and Sam Path talked about that, along with stable business volumes. We continue to see great volumes on the B2B side. Fixed wireless access continues to grow. We have a $2 billion base of revenue in FWA, and that continues to scale. You saw the results in Q4 there. The other thing that we'll inflect here is prepaid.\nThe positive volumes and the turnaround that Sampath talked about will result in improving revenue profile towards the back half of 2025. So that headwind will become a tailwind on prepaid. Then offsetting that, obviously, as Hans mentioned, is the depreciation. And that we said would peak in 2025. But as Hans mentioned, the customer economics are very healthy. And we said we expect the headwinds to ease towards the end of the year and into 2026. But as Sampath mentioned, we're seeking a better balance of P and Q. And I think you see that across both mobility and broadband. And we expect it to continue in 2025. And the actions that Sampath outlined in terms of execution are positioning us for sustainable revenue growth.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the Verizon Business Group, I'm going to ask Kyle to comment on it. But of course, the AI Connect is one contributor, but I think that the whole Verizon Business Group team has done a great job with many things. I mean, the wireless growth I've had the last couple of years is keeping grinding between 125,000 to 150,000 new net adds every quarter.\nThe Fixed Wireless Access that we were, I would say, a little bit surprised how successful Fixed Wireless Access is in the business group. But then all the cost takeouts they're doing, and if you saw the Q4 turning to a positive year-over-year improvement, I think we are onto something, even though with the pressure of the secular. So I wanted to say that, so Kyle doesn't need to say it, but the guys have done a terrific job. I'm cautiously optimistic that we can continue that work.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Hans. Thanks for the question, Sam. I won't belabor that. I think the revenue we booked that helped with EBITDA as far as AI Connect is small. That was our Q1 that we booked revenue there, so that did have a little impact. But it's mainly due to the factors that Hans spoke about. It's relentless focus on our cost and the driving efficiencies, as well as finding new opportunities in the revenue line. The team's done a good job at that. If you can see, we've had sequential growth since Q1. We've had three quarters in a row of sequential growth of EBITDA. For the first time in a long time, we've had growth year-over-year in the Q4 of EBITDA. I expect those trends to continue in 2025, given the groundwork that we've laid.\nWhat I would say, Hans talked about FWA. That's turned into a really good news story for us because we had certain expectations of the product. Now that we see customers are getting much more comfortable, business customers with using this as a primary option for them for connectivity, we continue to see great growth and great interest in the product. As a matter of fact, a lot of large customers who at first we weren't sure they would use this as a primary use case are. We have big banks, we have big retailers, etc., going and doing this. Then you just saw an announcement we made with Brightspeed. I think this is a new area of the market that we can tap. We call this really copper catch.\nSo it's using our fixed wireless access network to help people who have old kind of copper lines out there, low bandwidth lines, replace it and modernize it with FWA. And we see this as a great place that we can sell into too. And as we talked about private wireless and AI Connect. So we have a lot of great things on board here, and I feel good about our trajectory into 2025.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nHead of Telecom Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat. Awesome, Kyle. Thank you.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Sam. Brady, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. To sum up, maybe on the consumer side, you mentioned a couple of drivers of growth, tier one market, for instance, the Latino segment, and so on. And your lines have obviously grown on the postpaid side, but the account growth is still negative. So is there an opportunity to turn account growth positive with some of these newer segments that you're targeting? And is that something that we start to see over the course of the year? And then secondly, on inflation, I may have missed this as a response to the prior question, but is there a way for us to understand how you guys are thinking about the impact on overall volumes for the industry as a whole over the course of this year or beyond? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Kannan. I will ask Sampath to answer those questions, but I think we're in a really good position with our offerings to continue regardless of. But Sampath.\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath\n\nConsumer Group CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. Hey, Kannan, good morning to you. The question on the overall market growth, we think postpaid is expected to grow between eight and eight and a half million lines in 2025, all in for business and consumer. It's a robust market. It's a very resilient market. Similar to 2024, pre to post-migration makes up almost half of that. It's not a segment we play in on the retail side, but we leverage our wholesale channel to go after that segment aggressively.\nDespite there has been lower immigration in the last few quarters, yet we are seeing really strong performance in our value business. I think our refreshed value brands, our value proposition, our relationship with Walmart, as well as our expanded Total Wireless distribution, is working very well. So we can continue to grow phone net adds in this environment, and we feel very comfortable with that.\nNow, to answer your first question on account growth, we saw account growth in Q4. You see that. But I think at the end of the day, what we are focused on is building deep relationships with our customers. If you look at the way our offering framework works, we start with connectivity. We want to offer the best connectivity product, both home and on the go, and mobility, and of course, on the value side. And then on that foundation of that relationship, we start selling more to those customers, whether it's some of our entertainment products with perks, it gives you savings that others can't give. It's our TMP protection products, our cloud products. So we want to deepen our relationship with customers. And I think that's the way we see long-term growth in our business.\nYou saw very strong ARPA growth in the north of 4%, and underlying growth is, of course, much higher than that when you take care of pre-amortization. So account growth is important to us, but what is important to us is profitable customers who value quality of the network, and our offering framework. We want to grow in those.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nKyle Malady\n\nBusiness Group CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Kannan. Brady, that's all the time we have today.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."

Good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer Tony Skiadas.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on slide two of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our investor relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our investor relations website a detailed review of our second quarter results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, and welcome to Verizon's Q2 2024 earnings call. This quarter marks the beginning of Verizon's next chapter. We have launched a comprehensive brand refresh that goes far beyond the new logo. This transformation embodies our commitment to bringing choice, value, and control to our customers' lives. Reflecting our evolution and vision for the future of connectivity. We refreshed our brand as our strategy continues to deliver strong results. The three pillars of our performance, wireless service revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA expansion, and increased free cash flow, remain solid, showing both sequential and year-over-year improvements. In Q2, we saw wireless service revenue climb 3.5% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA rise by 2.8%, and free cash flow increased 3% compared to last year.\nOur improving operations and results build on our first quarter momentum, keep us on track to meet our 2024 financial guidance, and are paving the way for a sustained growth. Our progress comes from innovation that deeply resonates with customers, including the most personalized offerings in the industry. These initiatives align perfectly with our core strategy to strengthen and grow customer relationships while delivering the best return on invested capital. We launched myPlan in 2023, and it delighted our customers in just over a year. Over 30% of our subscribers are using it. That is an incredible adoption rate, and now we're bringing these features to home internet with myHome. We're building and expanding on our strengths and successes, and you can expect that to continue for businesses. We launched Verizon Business Complete, the industry's only end-to-end smartphone management system.\nWe cover everything from selecting the first phone to upgrades with 24-hour service and same-day equipment replacement. These initiatives, combined with our strong network performance and extensive distribution, are reinforcing our leadership position and driving our industry forward. Turning to the second quarter, we had a strong operational performance across mobility, broadband, and our network. Our overall execution in consumer mobility has been improving quarter after quarter since early last year, and our momentum continues. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds are up 12% year-over-year, which is amazing. Total postpaid phone net adds of 148,000 is a big improvement year-over-year and sequentially, and we expect to have positive postpaid phone net adds in consumer for the year. Choice is at the core of our approach, and we're constantly working on new partnerships that give our customers more options and value.\nOne example is our addition of YouTube Premium and Peacock subscriptions, which makes us the only provider offering our customers savings on 10 of the top streaming services. These content partnerships give our customers compelling reasons to shop with us. We also had a very strong quarter for postpaid phone net adds in Verizon Business at 156,000. This is a sharp improvement from the first quarter and shows how important we are to small, midsized, and large businesses. Our business customers continue to invest in mobility, and we offer them the widest range of choices in the consumer value market. We're applying the same customer-centric discipline and rigor as we do in the postpaid market and are seeing significant net adds improvements excluding SafeLink. We recently relaunched Total by Verizon at Total Wireless and enhanced our offerings with price guarantees, upgrade credits, and other features in broadband.\nWe're still taking share with 391,000 net adds in Q2. Fixed Wireless Access remains a key driver with higher net adds than in Q1. We continue to grow our broadband base, ending the quarter with more than 11.5 million broadband subscribers. We're also continuing to add business from large customers like government agencies. We're very proud that we were awarded a new contract from the US Department of the Navy to provide wireless devices and device management. Building on our previous work together for first responders, Verizon Frontline delivers mission critical connectivity and an advanced solution to more than 40,000 public safety agencies across the United States, serving them with everything from device and network management to digital transformation. Verizon is there when people need us most, from protecting the front lines to natural disaster response.\nIn fact, recent FCC data show us that overall our network outperformed our peers in areas affected by the Hurricane Beryl. I could not be prouder of that. It's one of the reasons we're so committed to the network superiority and we're continuing to expand C-Band in suburban and rural areas. Our initial C-Band markets outperform with better gross adds growth, higher uptake of premium services, and lower churn. We now have nearly half of our network traffic running on Ultra Wideband, up from 36% a year ago. That number will continue to grow as we expand C-Band reach. We're also working to enhance our network coverage by partnering with AST SpaceMobile to provide satellite to device connectivity using the 850 MHz spectrum. This will bring our network to unserved communities as we target 100% coverage from coast-to-coast.\nOur portfolio of high-performance spectrum, the capacity of our fiber, and our ability to deploy and support mobile edge compute make us the backbone of the AI economy and the partner of choice for players in the space. We will power the best AI services for our customers. What sets us apart with AI is our network's mobile edge computing capabilities and deep fiber footprint by processing data closer to the source. We enable real-time AI applications that require security, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth. This is where our network shines, opening up possibilities that simply weren't feasible before. We're already seeing the benefits of AI in our operations. For example, we use AI to route customer support calls to agents best suited to help. We analyze more than 800 data points per call to save our customers time and spare them frustration.\nIt takes the best network to power these applications, and today RootMetrics awarded us an outright win for national overall wireless network performance.\nVerizon also won the most national, state, and Metro awards including outright wins for accessibility, data performance, and streaming video performance. This is a kind of superior network performance that our customers deserve and expect from us. I'm pleased with our first half year performance on how well our team is executing our strategy. I always say there's more work to do and there always is. We are seeing improving postpaid phone net adds in consumer, performing extremely well in business, and taking share in broadband. We're achieving growth in a disciplined, balanced way and have built great momentum heading into the second half of the year and into 2025. Now I will hand over the call to Tony for a deeper dive into our performance.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning. Our Q2 results reflected accelerated growth in wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA as we continue to generate strong free cash flow. These results were driven by strong operational execution in both consumer and business which led to sequential net add improvements in postpaid phones, Fixed Wireless Access, and prepaid, excluding SafeLink. Within consumer, postpaid phone gross adds were approximately 1.8 million in Q2, a 12% year-over-year increase. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth. Excluding our second number offering, consumer postpaid phone gross adds grew 5% year-over-year. Consumer postpaid phone churn was 0.79% in Q2, up slightly from the prior year period. This was in line with our expectations as we recently implemented several price increases that are expected to generate well over $1 billion and annualized wireless service revenue.\nWe believe the majority of the pricing churn is now behind us and we continue to expect full year consumer postpaid phone churn to be flat or slightly better than last year. Consumer postpaid phone net losses were 8,000 for the second quarter, which marks a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. For the full year we expect to deliver positive consumer postpaid phone net adds without the contribution from our second number offering. Moving to prepaid, we continue to make progress with our core brands while navigating the conclusion of the ACP program. Overall prepaid net losses were 624,000, including 410,000 losses related to the ACP shutdown, the vast majority of which are in our SafeLink brand. Excluding SafeLink, prepaid net losses were 12,000, a substantial improvement compared to the prior year period.\nVisible and Total Wireless continued to expand and perform well while our operational execution with Straight Talk continues to improve. We exited the quarter with good momentum in prepaid, setting the stage for a stronger performance in H2 2024 and positioning us well for 2025. On the business side, postpaid phone net adds were 156,000 in the second quarter, the best performance in the last six quarters. We saw a strong sequential improvement of phone adds across small and medium businesses as well as enterprise and public sector customers. Turning to broadband, our total broadband net additions were 391,000 for the quarter, representing the eighth consecutive quarter. With over 375,000 broadband net adds in Fixed Wireless Access, we continue to focus on building a long-term sustainable business. Total fixed wireless net adds were 378,000 in the quarter, up sequentially.\nThis brings our base above 3.8 million subscribers, up nearly 69% year-over-year.\nConsumer fixed wireless net adds were 218,000, a 15,000 sequential increase as we continue to see healthy demand for reliable broadband even in a seasonally softer quarter. Verizon Business continued strong execution with 160,000 Fixed Wireless Access net adds. A quarterly record demand for the service is strengthening as small businesses and enterprises continue to trust the reliability of the product, speed, and ease of deployment. Overall Fios Internet net adds totaled 28,000 for the quarter. We are pleased with the continuous growth of Fios even with the effects of the ACP shutdown and lower move activity. We ended the quarter with over 11.5 million broadband subscribers, a 17% increase from a year ago. Our broadband growth continues to significantly outpace that of the broader market given our superior network experience and strong execution.\nMoving to the financials, we delivered another solid quarter and remain on track to meet our full year financial guidance. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter totaled $32.8 billion, a 0.6% increase year-over-year. That growth was driven by serviced and other revenue, which grew 1.8% year-over-year, partially offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue as total upgrades were down nearly 13% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue totaled $19.8 billion, a sequential increase of more than $250 million, and year-over-year growth of 3.5% or $660 million. The increase was primarily driven by consumer wireless service revenue, which grew 3.7% year-over-year to $16.3 billion. Consumer postpaid ARPA grew 5% year-over-year, reflecting the benefits of pricing actions and fixed wireless growth. In addition, myPlan helps drive ARPA growth through premium mix adoption and PERC revenue.\nAs Hans said, we now have over 30% of our consumer phone lines on myPlan and expect this to expand meaningfully going forward. FWA revenue, which is included in wireless service revenue, was $514 million for the quarter, up more than $200 million versus the prior year period. Launched at scale in 2021, our FWA business is expected to generate more than $2 billion in revenue this year with prospects for continued healthy growth. Prepaid revenue for the quarter declined $162 million versus the prior year period. The headwind to wireless service revenue growth from the ACP shutdown was approximately 30 basis points within the range we provided last quarter and the margin impact was insignificant. With the majority of ACP disconnects now behind us and the momentum growing in our core prepaid brands, we are better positioned for the remainder of the year and heading into 2025.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $12.3 billion, an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. The improved operating leverage reflects the lower upgrade activity and our disciplined approach to growth. We are making progress on our ongoing cost efficiency program and recently introduced new measures to improve our operating efficiency, including a voluntary separation program announced in June. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 5% compared to the prior year period. Growth in adjusted EBITDA was offset by below-the-line items including higher interest expense predominantly due to lower capitalized interest as we put more C-Band spectrum into service. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $16.6 billion for the first half of the year compared to $18 billion in the prior year period.\nThe results reflect higher cash taxes of approximately $1.7 billion, predominantly due to the unwind of bonus depreciation and as well as higher interest expense primarily driven by the decrease in capitalized interest. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $8.1 billion. This was $2 billion less than the same period last year. As we have returned to historical levels of capital intensity, the network build remains ahead of schedule with C-Band deployed on nearly 60% of our planned sites. Our full year guidance for CapEx spending remains unchanged at a range of $17 to 17.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $8.5 billion for the first half of 2024. This represents an increase of nearly 7%, or approximately $550 million from the prior year period.\nDespite higher cash taxes and interest expense, we expect to generate strong cash flow in the back half of the year that will support paying down debt. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.8 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the previous quarter and $3.7 billion lower year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to a consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.5x, an improvement from 2.6x last quarter. The strength of our results and momentum in our business put us in a great position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In particular, we remain on track to further reduce the leverage on our balance sheet in the second half of the year. In summary, with 2024 reaching its midpoint, the team's strong execution and operating momentum is translating into results.\nWe have good momentum in mobility as reflected by the strong gross add growth, and continue to take share in broadband through Fixed Wireless Access and Fios. Importantly, we are accomplishing this with a disciplined approach balancing growth and profitability, providing the confidence to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Hans for his final remarks before opening the call to your questions.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you Tony. Our focus for the second half of the year remains clear to drive growth in wider service revenue, expand adjusted EBITDA, and generate strong free cash flow. We are evolving our broadband strategy as we approach four to five million Fixed Wireless Access subscribers and will continue to scale the business along with the private networks while driving mobility growth. Our ongoing C-Band expansion will be crucial in supporting these efforts, enhancing our network performance and opening new opportunities across markets. Our commitment to a differentiated customer experience and operational excellence remains firm. The success of myPlan and our brand refresh are proof of our ability to meet evolving customer needs. We will build on these successes in the quarters ahead as we work to deliver value to all of our stakeholders.\nWe will continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities by investing in the business, supporting our dividend, and paying down debt. As AI continues to reshape our industry, Verizon is well positioned to enable and benefit from it. Our reliable, secure, and powerful network will be at the forefront of AI and mobile edge compute applications. This is an exciting time for us at Verizon. Mobility, broadband, and the cloud are essential services, and their value has never been higher. We power and empower how people live, work, and play. We are in a great business, and there is so much more to come. We have the right assets and a strategy in place for success this year and beyond. I'm more excited than ever about what lies ahead of us now. Brady, we are ready to take questions.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Please unmute your phone and record your name clear. When prompted, your name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your request, please press star two. One moment for the first question.\nThe first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks, and good morning, guys. Two questions, if I can. First on ACP, first of all, was there any impact on the broadband side in the quarter, and do you expect any lingering impact from ACP either in prepaid, postpaid, or broadband? As we look out into the second half, and then, second on upgrades, obviously another strong quarter with record, I think, record low upgrades.\nGiven the AI phones coming out in Q2, Q3, how do you expect that to trend and what do you expect the impact to be on the financials of the wireless business as we look out into H2?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThanks, John, on the ACP. Tony will give you the details. But yes, we had some impact on the prepaid brand, as was expected, and also a little bit on Fios. Looking forward, I see this as a great opportunity. I mean, 21 million people having ACP, and the importance of mobility and broadband today is so important, and our offerings all the way from broadband with Verizon Forward, Fixed Wireless Access, both very efficient, and then on the prepaid brands. So I see that as an opportunity going forward, but some slight impact on volumes this quarter on the upgrades. As you have seen, the upgrades has been a little bit low for a while. It's two things. First of all, the quality of the phones has continued to go up. But secondly, I think even more important is the discipline that we have shown over the years.\nRight now, I think for the last one and a half year, how we do the promotions, how we look at the customer investment.\ncan we see that we're actually distributing our money. We're going to see what's going to happen in this cycle. I don't feel very worried about it. I feel that we are in a great position to handle it. It's all in our guide, what we are expecting. So I don't see any major things happening here. Tony?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYes, thanks. Good morning, John. In terms of ACP updates, let me give you a couple of things here. So as we said previously, the majority of the ACP exposure is in our prepaid business. And as we said last time, we had about 1.1 million prepaid subs that benefited from the ACP program. In the quarter, Q2, we saw about 400,000 prepaid disconnects. This is the vast majority of what we expected. There's minimal impact on the postpaid side, as I think was part of your question. We saw some pressure in Fios in terms of gross add opportunity. If we look ahead in Q3, we expect some disconnects in prepaid and a small number across other products. In terms of revenue.\nWe also said that any impact that we would see, we'd see on service revenue up to 50 basis points of headwind, and we're tracking inside of that number right now. Even with the disconnects, the margin exposure from ACP was insignificant in Q2. We'll continue to keep everyone updated as we progress here.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nPerfect. Thanks, guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, great. Thanks, John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you very much. On fixed wireless, you talked about the strong momentum. You obviously have a lot of C-Band still to build out, expand your addressable market. You know, I guess you're going to hit the 4 million, the low end of your guide, probably in the August time frame. So help us think about what's the potential beyond the 4 to 5 million and when you can give us more clarity on your opportunity there. I think you've talked before about plenty of excess capacity. And then there were media reports the other day about you looking potentially to monetize towers. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about tower sales or other real estate, other asset monetization? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Simon. On Fixed Wireless Access, you're right, to say. We have good momentum. Came into this quarter with 378,000 new net adds on Fixed Wireless Access, doing strong both on consumer, as well as on business. We are now expanding our C-Band to suburban and rural, which is another type of opportunity, less penetrated but, but also more vastly distributed. So we are gearing for getting to our target between 4 and 5 million Fixed Wireless Access broadband customers. As soon as we get there, as I said before, I will come back and see how we see the opportunity going forward. But clearly we have great network that can ingest more customers over time. But let me come back on the exact details of that. When we reach a target on the towers or any rumor. I wouldn't comment on any rumor.\nWhat you should know is that Tony and I are very committed to improve our cash flow. Whatever we can do to ensure that we optimize our assets, we will do that. I have no comments on rumors in the market. The focus on cash flow is extremely important because it goes straight into our capital priorities that we have been so focused on for the last couple of years. We did yet again in this quarter good progress on them.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Hans. Yeah, great.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. First, on broadband, could you comment on sort of the overall health of the broadband market that you're seeing, and then maybe any more quantitative guidance you can give us on the amount of headroom you see in your overall network capacity relative to fixed wireless subscribers? Secondly, on the wireless side, in terms of the service revenue growth, what's your level of confidence that you can drive more volume growth and still maintain the same level of pricing power over the next 12 months or so? And how do you expect that volume price split to work out for you over the next year or so?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo on the broadband head, I think again we are between 375,000 to 400,000 net adds in broadband this quarter, been there for quite a while.\nSo we see it as very healthy. I think also we have a really good offering. And now with myHome that we just announced, I think we're going to be even stronger on it. So we see it healthy. Of course, Fios is by far the best fiber product in the market. And then Fixed Wireless Access, the differentiation of the product, how we deploy it, how the customer.\nProvision, it is so different. With all the streaming agreements we have right now, we can scale that horizontally to all our customers. I see it as a very.\nHealthy business for us today when it comes to our capacity to on Fixed Wireless Access. Yet again, as we said, less than around 50% of all the traffic is now on C-Band. So we have way to go. And we have deployed only a portion. So as we deploy more, we of course open up more opportunities. Finally, and maybe Tony has some addition on the volume growth.\nI'm excited. All what we've done in the consumer side with my plan and all the new innovations we have done with our customers and we see it resonates with the market, and clearly quarter by quarter we have improved both our revenue, but also operation volumes on postpaid, prepaid. You saw it yourself, big step forward on prepaid this quarter, and then our business side. I mean, Kyle and the team has been now for, I'm not sure how many quarters, business been around 125 to 150 net adds on wireless. So all in all I see that with the offerings we put into the market, the refresh of the brand that is supporting that we are in a good position going into the second half of this year. Tony, in addition to that.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks Hans. So very comfortable with the revenue guide for the year. As Hans said, the performance and execution is very much on track, and we continue to find a better balance of P&Q. And you see the progress on volumes as Hans said, B2B Mobility and FWA. And maybe just a few additional points to consider. First, you know we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half of the year. Also, I would say the year-over-year comps are a little more challenging the second half as we lap the pricing changes from 2023. The wildcard obviously is the promotional environment and the level of upgrades. We'll have to see where that goes. But having said all that, the assumptions that we have in the service revenue guide have not changed.\nOverall we feel good about our revenue performance and the momentum in the business, and we're not going to guide on 25 at this time. But I would tell you that those assumptions will carry forward as well.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYes, thanks Jim. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the 2024 consumer postpaid phone expectations to report positive net adds for the year excluding the second line. If you could perhaps maybe help us think about the pace or expectations for the second line contribution in the back half of the year. Obviously pretty healthy run rate here in the second quarter on a full quarterly basis relative to the first quarter. So just how should we think about that in terms of trying to unpack the underlying benefit relative to the second line benefit? Tony, another quick question. Just helpful color there on service revenue expectations, quarterly growth over the balance of the year.\nCan you perhaps help us think about margins, obviously decent nice growth here in the second quarter in business? How should we think about the contribution, perhaps from the HCLTech managed services savings coming through? I think you also mentioned there was a voluntary separation program in the market. I think we had seen headlines of that intra-quarter. How should we think about maybe the contributions from those two items impacting margin and maybe EBITDA growth expectations, or how you're thinking about the phasing of those in the back half? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. I thought. Tony will give you details. As we said before, the second line offering is straight into our strategy. The strategy is to build the network once and have as many profitable connections on top of it in order to get the best return on invested capital. You can see that is really happening, and that's been a very big focus for us. Tony will give you some more details on how it looks in the second half here. On the programs of cost, we put in last year a couple of really large programs, all the way from agreement with HCL, together with large customer care changes. Many of those are now coming into the base, and that's why you see the leverage.\nBut we also have quite a lot of new things coming up, and as you rightfully mentioned, we have a voluntary separation program that is ongoing right now. We also have all the efficiencies with AI that is coming through. And of course we continue with our disciplined approach on investment. So all in all there's more things to come. But we have gotten leverage from some of the things we did last year.\nTony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks Sebastiano. On the second number, just a few points. Hans touched on this upfront, but this is great business. We're providing customers options and flexibility. It is a very profitable connection, and we would do it every day of the week in terms of the market for this. We'll see how the TAM evolves. We saw the gross add impact, and you can assume some level of churn in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect less of a contribution from second number in the back half of the year. It's high margin business comparable to ARPU add line offerings. You know the ARPU is very good and very comparable to add line without the device subsidy. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive postpaid net adds in consumer for the year without the contribution from second number.\nThe results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. On your question on EBITDA and cost transformation, we're very comfortable with the EBITDA guide. We made a lot of progress, he said, saw the 80 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, and you know, the program in terms of delivering cost transformation is on track. Hans talked about some of the work we're doing and we did last year with customer care and with managed services. We have a lot of work going on right now between IT, real estate, and network decommissioning. In addition, Hans mentioned the voluntary separation program, and some of that savings will start manifesting in the back end of this year and into 2025. Then lastly, you know, AI is an enabler of efficiencies.\nYou can think about customer care, you can think about the personalization with myPlan and you know, we see efficiencies coming from there as well. But we're very much on track, we're operating differently and we feel good about the progress on cost actions that are driving the improvements in EBITDA that you see in the first half of the year.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you for the question.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks Sebastiano. Brad, we're ready for the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks and good morning. Curious on the pricing front, where does the wireless postpaid back book sit on average relative to your front book offers? Do you think the pricing environment in the postpaid wireless category can start to look more like fixed broadband or the video product categories where those products have tended to see some kind of pricing action on a somewhat annual basis?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Mike. I think, in general, when we see the value accretion we have done recently very much about new offerings to see that our customers are getting more value from the offerings we have, we have done some price adjustments historically. I think that Sampath in the consumer side has said that he will get better balance between volume and value increases. So that's what you see right now. And then on the business side we have constantly done a great job. I mean he, Kyle and his team has constantly continue with a really high market share, continued to gain in every area like government, large enterprise, and SMBs.\nSo in the quarter, you saw that the offerings we're doing with myHome, the additions on myPlan, and of course with also the new offerings in business, Business Complete, which is a new way to serve our SMBs. All of them are accretive in value, but also giving our customer better services. So that's how we continue to work. We are in sort of a third phase of wireless where wireless is so important for our customers, and we see it also as an opportunity with the largest direct-to-consumer business in the country to actually add support with them with new services and layering on. Tony?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYes. Just a couple of other things to add. I mean, as we said up front, we said we need to find a better balance of P&Q in 2024, and we're doing that. We're very confident, Mike. In our back book, we've been very consistent, as Hans said, about evaluating pricing opportunities, aligning the price with the value proposition for customers. We did take pricing actions in the first half of the year that provide a good tailwind to service revenue. Those pricing actions were contemplated in the guide. But it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on what we might do in the future.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nYes, thanks.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question, sir.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much. So, Tony, yeah, you guys have had real demonstrable success on the P side of the equation, and it helped lead the industry upward. Can we talk a little bit more about the Q, the account number that you reported this quarter? I think it's the lowest that we've seen since the data I have going back to like 2016. And so the way that the queue is growing is by kind of a shrinking number of accounts, but putting more and more into those accounts. I'm guessing the second line strategy is one of those strategies.\nBut can you talk a little bit about what kind of duration, durability, you know, this approach to growth has, and/or do we need to see accounts grow in order to believe that Verizon's really on the right growth path? Thanks.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nHi, Dave. Good morning. So look, as we said before, finding the right balance of P&Q. And I think you've heard Sampath and I talk about something like 80, 20 price, volume, mix. Last year was more like 100. So clearly making progress on that. Keep in mind, we have a very high quality customer base and we see it in the results quarter after quarter. And I think you see the momentum in both gross adds and in net adds in the quarter. And it's very high quality growth both on the consumer and the business side. Business had a very strong quarter as well on volumes. And you also see the growth on Fixed Wireless Access. We did 378,000 Fixed Wireless Access net adds that continue to provide a tailwind to service revenue.\nSo we're trying to find that right balance of P&Q, and I think the results reflect that.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYep.\nThanks, Dave. Brad, ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMorning. Thanks. A question about capital allocation. As we approach 2025 and your leverage target, I'm wondering how you would encourage us to think or how you do think about the possibility of building more fiber as opportunity, costing that against share repurchases. I wonder how you think about the returns on each of those projects. And separately, to the extent that capital is scarce, is there an argument for maintaining leverage at a constant level in order to do more of both? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nHey, Peter, when it comes to our capital allocation priorities, they haven't changed. I mean, first of all, we put the money in the business, and this year we have the guide between $17 billion and $17.5 billion, so. But of course, if we see opportunities to gain more revenue and grow business, we will always look into the business side. Secondly, the dividend is very important. I mean, we have now been growing our dividend for 17 consecutive quarters. And Tony and my job: years, not quarters. And Tony and I are committed to continue to put the board in a position do that. And you see on our pay ratio, we're well inside that ratio, doing well. And then we're paying down our debt. We paid down debt this quarter, second half; we're going to continue with that.\nWe will not consider any conversation about buybacks until we get to $225 and after that. There's a lot of factors in the market, the priorities, but also where is the interest rates, where is the share price, and all of that. So let us focus on the priority in the order we have said, and that's how we're going to continue for the next foreseeable future.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Peter. Brad, ready for the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question. Sir.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. I want to return to the upgrade cycle. Apple is obviously betting that they can drive a significant upgrade cycle with. I wonder if you could just talk about the percentage of phones in your base that are. I believe Apple's requirement will be 8GB of RAM, meaning it's going to be the iPhone 15.\nPro or Pro Max. What percentage of your phones are already of that level, and how many would presumably require upgrades? And then, how you think about how quickly that upgrade cycle comes and what that might mean in terms of the cost and margins for your wireless business?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Craig. I don't have the exact number, but I know that we have a fair amount of new phones, of course, in the base because with our high quality customer base on postpaid, many of our customers are already on later versions of the phones.\nAgain, looking into this cycle, of course we're going to see some excitement around AI. I don't think that it's going to be any particular at this time. It will be over time, maybe we have very disciplined model when it comes to approach and segmentation for promotion, etc. We will stick to the that we believe that we have such a great network, great offerings, so we can actually manage that, and we will continue to do so.\nThen talking about AI, I think where I'm most excited is of course that we have built on a Verizon intelligent edge network which will be the backbone for the GenAI economy because you're going to have to have a lot more compute storage at the edge of the network, and that's how we, we built a network already from 2018 with fiber to all our main hubs and between our main SAP centers, and then on top of that we have cooling and power at those edges. I think as we go from the LLMs and we go into sort of doing commercial products for enterprises, our network is set up for that. So I'm very excited for that opportunity going forward together with private networks.\nSo there's a lot of things coming into GenAI devices, our efficiencies, but also business opportunity for us when it comes to AI.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nGreat, thanks Craig. Brad, ready for the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open, sir.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you. To what extent do you think that fixed mobile conversion will be more of the norm in the US, and given your smaller wireline footprint, do you think you need to expand your fiber to the home assets, or how would you address that? And then want to clarify the target leverage you're looking for. Is that 2.2 times total leverage or 2.2 times unsecured? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the.\nMobile convergence, fixed mobile convergence, we see some uptick on that. As I said before, we will follow the customers. We have own economics on wireless and on broadband, and we will see that if our customer wants to have a converged product, we will do that. I don't believe in sort of discounting products to get there, but of course our efficiency, one customer have both mobility and broadband from us, and we will see that we share that with our customers as an opportunity. So I don't think we're going to see the European levels here because of the nature of the market. But as we move further into convergence, we will be very well positioned with the products we have. Tony, on the leverage.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYes. So Frank, on the leverage metric, the long term goal is 1.75 to 2 on the unsecured. And then we said we would consider buybacks when we got to 2.25. Again, unsecured.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Frank. Brad, Ray, for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\n\nTim Horan\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey guys, focusing back on the network. I know the C-Band initial deployments were just for a portion of the spectrum, and they weren't using the full range of technologies. And I know you said 60%. Can you talk about where are you with kind of upgrading to the entire C-Band level of spectrum and to Massive MIMO, and also then to Standalone, and kind of related to this? I know you saw some major network improvements with the initial upgrades or build out to C-Band. Can you talk about what you're seeing when you go back with the second upgrade and how to follow up on what you do with AI? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the C-Band, you're right. We almost have now 50% of our traffic on the C-Band, but we still have some deployment to be done in suburban and rural. Many of those sites are prepared for it. So we are rolling out as we speak right now. So we're going to see that continue. Joe and his team in network and technology very much focused on customer satisfaction when it comes to rollout and revenue generation. Right now that's the main focus we have with it. And the same trend as we saw in the beginning where we have better upgrades, lower churn where we have C-Band, and of course also getting Fixed Wireless Access opportunities. Same goes for when we are enhancing or continuing to new areas. Secondly, you asked about all the new features coming in 5G Advanced with SA Massive MIMO.\nAll of that is just expanding our capacity and bringing even more opportunities for us for revenue, and seeing that we create the customer expectations on the best network in the nation. And that's just where you're in the beginning of that. So I'm very pleased. What I see, the team is running as fast as it can, and we get good feedback on C-Band. Tony?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Hans. So just a couple other points. On C-Band, we're seeing good improvements in churn, 3 basis points on gross adds. We see about 9 basis points gross add strength, and as we deploy suburban and rural, gross adds are up threefold in those markets. Then premium mix continues to be strong, stronger as well, of about 10%, and we do have now, at this point, nearly 60% of our cell sites now deployed with C-Band, so really making really good progress.\n\nTim Horan\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nI'm assuming you need standalone to enable some of these AI/MEC applications you're talking about, and I could be wrong about that. But any upgrade on the timing of when standalone gets deployed nationwide, and do you have any of these AI/MEC applications that are up and running now? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo.\nWe can do mobile edge compute without SA. We have done that for five years. Then there are some efficiencies on special private networks and deployment with SA. But again you need the full ecosystem all the way from the devices, and the network features, and the core in order to do that. So it's a little bit of a holistic thinking again when we work it. But we can already deliver that right now when it comes to GenAI in non-mobile edge compute that we don't, we don't have that to our customers right now but the conversation with many of both the cloud players as well as enterprises of doing that when they have commercial products and not only training large language models and that's how we designed our network. So that's why I'm excited about it.\nAt the same time, we already have four GenAI products in the market that is deployed on 40,000 agents, retail stores, et cetera, personalization, more efficiency for customer and employee experience, and we see a great opportunity for that. So there are multiple opportunities with AI for us, and we have been onto it for a long time.\n\nTim Horan\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks Tim. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed\n\nThanks Tony. I think in the prepared remarks you referenced voluntary separation program in June. I wonder if you can give us a sense of, I mean I know you've done these in the past, potential EBITDA benefit and just remind us does this result like in non, I guess, one-time charges relative to the severance or the separation payments that are made and just kind of quantify that a bit if you can.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nSure. Hi Walt. So a couple things. We announced the program in early June for a portion of our workforce. The process is not going to be fully completed until the back end of August. So I don't have numbers at this point. It was contemplated in our full year guide, and we do expect to see savings towards the point back end of 2024 and into 2025, and we'll come back with disclosures on the program. Once it's finalized, we'll file an 8-K similar to how we did it last time.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed",
    "content2": "Okay. And then Hans, it's not a reported number, but you can kind of calculate what wholesale revenue looks like. And we know who the principal driver of that is. It seemed like that was kind of strong this quarter sequentially. I don't know if there's some seasonality there. I'm looking last year and the year before. It doesn't seem like that. So is this a good thing or a bad thing? Obviously, because it could, you know, could imply stronger growth at a wholesale customer at the expense of your retail business. And just can you give us a sense in general of your outlook for that line? There's been some, you know, some discussion and debate about, you know, how some terms can change or, you know, other offloading activities can occur for that customer.\nSo just, you know, if you can comment on the quarter and just generally your outlook for wholesale in terms of a component of your, you know, your sectors of growth. Like, how important is wholesale in terms of meeting the growth targets that you promised the board?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nI don't have any comments on the quarter, on the numbers. You know, we try to have our Chinese walls here, so I don't have it. But in general we see these partnerships as important enterprise customers, and it goes back to the strategy we have, meaning we build the networks once and we want to have as many profitable connections on top of the network in order to get the best return on invested capital. So that's where we are, and we have a good relationship with the MNO customers, and we have many of them. It will continue. Tony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, look, I mean, the, you know, it's very profitable business, as Hans said, and is a great contribution to revenue and EBITDA consistent with the strategy to monetize the network. And we're very comfortable with the arrangements we have, but that's as far as we can go.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nYep.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed\n\nWell, can I just pivot and just then just ask one related but, you know, kind of high-level question. There's been some reports of T-Mobile doing some additional fiber asset, you know, joint partnerships, you know, if the administration changes, maybe there's opportunities for, you know, some additional vertical integration. But I guess the big question is, at least for me, how important is it in the long term for you to have a vertical solution for customers, meaning that the consumer can buy their home broadband and their wireless services from you and, or, and if you're not doing that.\nObviously outside of the Fios markets, is that a risk if others put together that vertical solution?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nWe are well positioned in that area. Again, if the market got convergence between mobility and broadband, we will be there to serve our customers either with Fios or Fixed Wireless Access. Right now, that's working really good for us. So we're happy with our assets we have and how we're deploying them. Right now we're looking into how we continue to meet our customer demands. Now we also launched, as you saw in the quarter on the consumer side, myHome, where we have all the benefits we had from myPlan. We're moving over to myHome. So I feel good about what our consumer division is doing on broadband and mobility at the moment with the products. We are number one in the market. So we just need to continue to keep the lead and continue to keep innovating.\nI feel good about the consumer team doing that.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYep.\nThanks, Walt. Brad, we ready for the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sam McHugh of BNP Paribas. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nGood morning, guys. Two quick questions. In the last few years, you've gone through quite a big reinvestment phase, I guess, in the consumer division with the launch of myPlan, the refresh of the brand this quarter. As we look out kind of the next two or three years and take a big step back, should we think you're now at a place where EBITDA can sustainably grow ahead of service revenues? Yes, that's question one, and the second part, just a clarification. Tony, you mentioned something about H2 wireless service revenue trends versus the first half. If you wouldn't mind just repeating it, that'd be very helpful, thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nWhen it comes to continue to have leverage on our EBITDA, which together with our service revenue, I think it's clear for us that the KPIs that we are measured on as a management team, and me myself is on the growth on the service revenue, wireless service revenue expansion, as well as EBITDA and cash flow. That's how we work is holistically. So, yes, we are. Our goal is to see that we have the leverage on our service revenue growth right now. We have great products, we work with efficiency.\nThere are, of course, pressures in our business as any business, but that's what we strive for. But we don't guide for 25 or something like that at this moment. We'll come back on that, but our work and our KPIs are set up for that. Tony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks. Hi, Sam. So, on the service revenue for the second half. What we said is we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half. And when we talked about the assumptions that we had in the guide, we said, look, we had pricing actions that we've already taken, and you see that well over $1 billion. We also said we have an improving volume profile in consumer, and you see that progress. Fixed Wireless Access continues to scale, and you know, we have over $500 million now in Fixed Wireless Access revenue on a run rate of over $2 billion. And that base of business continues to grow. We also said we had headwinds in prepaid, and that's improving, and we'll see that improving as time goes on.\nAnd then, promo amortization and the promo discipline continues to be encouraging, and we say we see a similar level year-over-year. Those assumptions haven't changed, and we feel really good about the performance, service revenue, and the momentum we have in the business heading into the second half.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nAwesome. Thanks, Tony.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nGreat. Thanks, Sam. Brad, we have time for one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks.\nGood morning. I have one for Tony and one for Hans. Tony, regarding free cash flow, it's up, I think, about 12% year-over-year in the first half. Do you anticipate being able to grow free cash flow this year, or is the year-to-date growth we've seen more a function of favorable timing in the first half with higher CapEx and working capital usage coming in the second half? And then Hans, you had talked quite a bit about Verizon's strong position for AI and enterprise. Is there anything you can share on what you're seeing in 5G enterprise adoption and also in the sales pipeline activity that you're seeing? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nI start with the first one, and then I can hand it over to Tony on the cash flow. Yes, what we see is private networks continue to grow in volume, which is a prelude. You know, you start with a private network, then you start adding on applications on it, and of course ultimately you put in mobile edge compute. We have all that set up since 2018, 2019, and we start seeing more and more business case for logistics centers, for factories, etc. Where we can do it, and then GenAI will only sort of capitalize that and do it even faster. That's going to take some time because right now many corporation enterprises are in the learning process, meaning training their data sets. So it's going to take some time.\nBut I don't think that anyone is even close to be as well positioned as we are in GenAI and the GenAI economy, both for taking advantage of it efficiency wise internally, but definitely from a revenue point of view all the time.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks. Hi, Brian. So on free cash flow, overall, the cash generation of the business continues to be very strong. In the first half of the year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up 7%. We were able to grow cash flow in the second quarter even with an incremental $1.7 billion in cash taxes. As we said in April, we expect free cash flow to have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. We still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year as we described back in January. Within that framework, we see slightly more incremental pressure from cash taxes and offsetting, that is the lower upgrades. We'll have to see where that goes.\nOverall, the strong position and cash flow puts us in a position to pay down debt in H2 2020. We're on track to do so.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks very much.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nYeah, great, Brad. That's all the time we have today.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect.\nIt."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website.\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nEarlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our first quarter results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we have started the year with a solid momentum, building on the progress we made throughout 2023. Our results this quarter further validate that our strategy is working and position us well for a profitable growth this year. Our execution in the first quarter keeps us on track towards our full year 2024 guidance as we continue to deliver against our key financial metrics.\nWe grew wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA and generated solid free cash flow. Operational excellence is our priority. Our team is delivering. We have the right strategy, and we're working to keep this progress up quarter by quarter.\nIt has been a busy quarter across our business. We produced big moments at the Super Bowl, published our first consumer connections report, achieved milestones in our C-band rollout, added new members to our leadership team, published our annual ESG report, accomplished many goals with Citizen Verizon and completed a pension transaction that increases our financial flexibility.\nVerizon has a differentiated position in the industry. We have the highest quality customer base in Consumer and Business, the largest adjusted EBITDA and a great team that knows how to execute our strategy.\nTurning to our first quarter results. Wireless service revenue growth climbed to 3.3%. Our revenue performance, combined with our work on cost efficiency programs, translated to a $12.1 billion adjusted EBITDA. That's a year-over-year growth of 1.4%. We generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, and we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023.\nOur core products on mobility, broadband and private networks are at the center of people's lives and businesses. Connectivity is only becoming more vital with each passing day. And our investments and world-class network ensure that our customers can depend on us to deliver the reliable, high-quality experience they deserve.\nNow let me go into some specifics about this quarter. Our Consumer team is executing extremely well. Despite taking further pricing action this quarter, our postpaid full net adds performance improved year-over-year, evidence of how our differentiated value proposition is resonating with customers.\nOur net loss of 158,000 is more than 100,000 net adds better than our first quarter performance in 2023. This achievement was fueled by continued momentum in postpaid phone gross adds, which grew more than 5% year-over-year. We mitigated churn impacts from pricing actions through laser-focused retention efforts and the strength of our value proposition.\nThese results represented Verizon Consumer Group's strongest first quarter postpaid phone net adds performance since 2018. Our targeted and segmented go-to-market approach, combined with myPlan and its exclusive perks, is clearly working. With myPlan, we are building a recurring revenue stream out of perks and services. These incentives, like our popular Netflix plus Max bundle, add value and deepen our customer relationships. We know our customers extremely well and tailor our offerings to their needs.\nWe're bringing the same proven approach to our prepaid business. Within the quarter, we established our new value market leadership team, bringing experts to execute our plans with speed and discipline. While there is still work to be done, we're seeing early signs of progress in Visible and Total By Verizon.\nIn February, we stopped processing new affordable connectivity program activations, which caused headwinds for our SafeLink brand. The ACP may shut down. But Verizon is committed to providing households with access to high-quality connectivity and reliable home Internet without data caps and does not believe that income should be a barrier to access.\nSince 2020, we have offered high-speed home Internet to qualifying customers for as low as $20 a month through our Verizon Forward program. And we have other plans to reach households who rely on ACP.\nFor Business mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 90,000. The team continues to put up subscriber growth as the market share leader in a competitive environment, even while implementing pricing actions within the quarter. More businesses rely on Verizon than any other provider to deliver mission-critical support for the day-to-day operation.\nIn total, first quarter postpaid phone net losses were 68,000, a 59,000 net loss improvement versus prior year. We're exiting the quarter with both Consumer and Business delivering their strongest performance in March, a good sign for the year ahead.\nOur broadband business continued to be a key growth engine, now serving more than 11 million subscribers. We have grown our base 18% over the last year, and our network is a critical part of the infrastructure that homes and businesses rely on.\nFixed wireless access has turned out to be a large and growing opportunity. This is now a meaningful piece of our business. We knew that fixed wireless access would be a hit with consumers, who like its quality, reliability and easy setup.\nBusinesses are showing similar excitement as this was our biggest quarter to date for the net adds in business fixed wireless access with 151,000 setting our new high.\nFios remains extremely popular with one of the highest third-party Net Promoter Score in the industry. And as we already know, Fios is the best pure broadband offering in the country. Together, our total broadband portfolio delivered a strong quarter with 389,000 net adds. As with mobility, we saw good momentum with the broadband net adds as we exited the quarter, and we expect that to continue.\nWe also had a great quarter in private networks, signing transformative deals across industries. Xerox selected our network and service solution as its framework for modernizing its information technology system. We also signed a new private network deal with a global power solution leader, Cummins Inc. And iconic American sports leagues are turning to us for their networks that serve their fans, players and cultures. We're on the field, on the aisles and in the stands and in the parking lots.\nDuring the quarter, we held a partner summit, where we unveiled our sports and entertainment strategy. We are at the center of the culture moments that matter the most to our customers from concerts and performance to athletic achievements and competition. We're already in every national football league stadium in the country. We're now expanding services with NFL teams, including the installation of a private 5G network at the LA Chargers' training facility.\nWe also renewed our partnership as the official 5G network of the National Hockey League in the United States and are expanding services throughout its arenas. As you may have seen in our consumer connection report, during the '23, '24 NFL season, the average fan used more data than the year before. These live moments matter to our customers, and they want to share them by text, by phone and by video. We are a vital part of their experiences.\nOur private networks business is growing and full of long-term contracts with the best partners around the world. All of this is supported by the infrastructure we have built and are building. We operate the nation's most reliable and robust network for all customers from households to global enterprises.\nRecently, we passed 250 million POPs covered with C-band, achieving our target almost a year ahead of plan. The pace and quality of our build-out is spectacular. Most importantly, our customers love the C-band experience. In the first 76 markets where we rolled out C-band, we see higher premix and reduced churn.\nOur strategy from the start was to build the network once to meet the needs of the present and to optimize it for the future. And we're doing just that.\nWe have been working with AI for several years, and our powerful network position Verizon to lead the AI revolution. In 2023, we released a set of responsible AI principles to guide our efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact our stakeholders and establish Verizon as a trusted brand and partner with respect to AI.\nEnabling AI at scale for improved customer service is a key. We're also aggressively driving AI transformative potential with our businesses, something our network was built to support. We already had several generative AI projects going live.\nOur AI strategy focused on 3 priorities. First, optimizing internal processes and operation through machine learning such as creating efficiencies in fuel consumption. AI is already centered to our cost transformation program and will become even more important over time.\nSecondly, enhancing product experiences with AI capabilities like the personalized plan recommendation on myPlan, which is producing good, early results. And thirdly, establishing an AI-based revenue stream by commercializing our network's unique low latency, high bandwidth and robust mobile edge compute capabilities.\nGenerative AI workloads represent a great long-term opportunity for us. As we expand our network and increase our performance advantage, we are also making Verizon a more efficient organization.\nWe are back to business as usual level on CapEx spend as we had promised. And we have struck a balance between profitable growth and free cash flow that supports both our dividend and a stronger balance sheet. This gives us greater flexibility to accelerate deleveraging throughout the second half of the year, bringing us closer to our long-term leverage target.\nOur dividend is healthy and secure. And our free cash flow dividend payout ratio continues to improve. We are focused on putting our Board in a position to continue to raise the dividend each year, building on our current industry record of 17 consecutive increases.\nNow let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. Tony?\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong execution of our team, building on the momentum from 2023 and delivering solid results in our 3 priorities of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nWe saw further improvements in postpaid phone net adds and another strong quarter of growth in our broadband subscriber base. We accomplished this while maintaining our promotional discipline as evidenced by our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.4% and more than 16% year-over-year free cash flow growth.\nConsumer postpaid phone net losses were 158,000 for the quarter, better versus the prior year by 105,000 driven by improvements in both gross adds and churn. As Hans mentioned, this represents our best first quarter performance in Consumer postpaid phone net adds since 2018. We continue to see improved operational performance with Consumer postpaid phone gross adds up more than 5% year-over-year. And as you heard from Hans, we exited the quarter with good momentum.\nThe changes we made over the last few quarters, including launching a regional sales structure and updating our sales compensation plans, provide the right framework for our go-to-market approach. We believe these changes, combined with the continued success of myPlan and increased utilization of C-band, will help us sustain our momentum.\nConsumer postpaid phone churn of 0.83% represents a 1 basis point improvement year-over-year. This result is a reflection of the strength of our value proposition as well as our high-quality customer base. The first quarter postpaid phone net add improvement coincided with a further decline in upgrades, which were down nearly 21% year-over-year. We continue to see success with our disciplined and segmented approach to customer offers in alignment with our strategy.\nOn the Business side, we delivered 90,000 postpaid phone net adds. Business volume results were challenged early in the quarter as the team implemented pricing increases in January. However, we saw positive net add momentum built throughout the quarter, and we exited the quarter well positioned to continue to build on operational improvements in both mobility and broadband.\nThat sales performance helped Verizon Business achieve fixed wireless access net adds of 151,000, their best quarterly result to date. We've been pleased with how businesses have adopted FWA, and we continue to see strong demand from small businesses and enterprises, which are attracted to the ease of deployment, reliability and the flexibility of the product.\nFixed wireless net adds for Consumer were 203,000, resulting in a consolidated total of 354,000. This reflects the attractiveness of FWA as an alternative to traditional cable broadband, even in the market that saw muted activity. We continue to be comfortable with this pace of growth, believing it provides the right combination of base growth, ARPU accretion and the superior experience our customers expect on the Verizon network.\nAnd our third-party Net Promoter Scores for our FWA product continue to outpace traditional cable broadband offerings as we remain focused on building a long-term sustainable business. Overall, broadband net adds were 389,000, including 53,000 Fios Internet net adds. We're pleased with how Fios continues to grow in the marketplace even as move activity across the country remains lower than prior years.\nWe finished the quarter with over 11.1 million broadband subscribers, including over 3.4 million on FWA. We've now added more than 3 million broadband subscribers in the last 2 years alone. On prepaid, starting this quarter, we are disclosing subscriber results with and without our SafeLink brand. This disclosure provides improved transparency into our prepaid results. As a reminder, SafeLink is our government subsidy program brand offering and holds the majority of our ACP customers.\nThe actions we've taken to scale Visible and Total By Verizon as well as address operational execution with Straight Talk drove improvements in our prepaid performance. Prepaid net losses, excluding SafeLink, were better by 146,000 year-over-year.\nWhile we are pleased to see the improvements, we still have work to do to address challenges in the prepaid business. That includes navigating the uncertainty around ACP. And we recently announced plans to provide accessible, affordable and reliable connectivity options for those who need it most.\nAs a reminder, we have approximately 1.1 million prepaid ACP subscribers as of the end of the first quarter. We expect the elimination of the program to result in lower wireless service revenue but have minimal impact on our adjusted EBITDA.\nMoving to our financials. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $33 billion, up 0.2% year-over-year. The benefit of the pricing actions we took in the quarter combined with improved operating metrics offset the year-over-year decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to lower upgrades.\nWireless service revenue growth was 3.3% for the first quarter. This represents a significant acceleration in our revenue growth. And the full year 2023 growth rate, excluding the reallocation of certain revenues, was only 1.3%.\nConsumer led the way with wireless service revenue growth of 3.4% driven by ARPA growth of 4.4% and improved year-over-year postpaid phone net add performance. In addition to targeted pricing actions, ARPA continues to benefit from the further adoption of myPlan. myPlan has been instrumental in growing our premium mix, which now stands at 42% of our postpaid phone base.\nWe're also starting to see a growing impact from perk revenue as we scale the number of subscriptions. With over 20% of the postpaid base on myPlan, we see further opportunities for ARPA accretion as we expect to double the number of customers on myPlan in our postpaid base by the end of this year.\nFor the first time, we are disclosing fixed wireless access revenue within our externally released results. FWA revenue, which is included in wireless service revenue, was $452 million for the quarter, up nearly $200 million versus the prior year.\nHeadwinds in prepaid revenue continue to partially offset the gains from ARPA performance in wireless service revenue. For the quarter, prepaid revenue declined $106 million versus the prior year. While this is an improvement over the prior quarter, it represented an approximately 60 basis point drag on total wireless service revenue growth.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA was approximately $12.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1.4% compared to the prior year driven by the growth in wireless service revenue as well as the impact of lower upgrade volumes. With a full quarter impact from our recent pricing actions, we anticipate the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA growth to accelerate year-over-year.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, were down 0.5% year-over-year. Lower cost of equipment and cost of services were partially offset by an increase in SG&A.\nAdjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 4.2% compared to the prior year as gains in adjusted EBITDA were more than offset by higher interest expense, predominantly due to the lower capitalized interest now that a large portion of the C-band spectrum licenses have been placed into service.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up over 16% or nearly $400 million from the first quarter 2023. On a full year basis, nothing has changed. With free cash flow, we still expect the same puts and takes we shared with you in January.\nAs Hans said, we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Cash flow from operating activities came in at $7.1 billion. Within the quarter, we saw year-over-year pressures from higher interest expense primarily related to the reduction in capitalized interest. We also made a discretionary pension contribution of $365 million prior to the closing of the retiree pension annuity transaction that we previously disclosed.\nCapEx for the quarter was $4.4 billion compared to $6 billion in the prior year as a result of our return to BAU levels of spend and historical levels of capital intensity. Our full year guidance of $17 billion to $17.5 billion in CapEx spending remains unchanged.\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126 billion, a $3.7 billion improvement year-over-year and a nearly $400 million improvement sequentially. During the quarter, we issued our sixth green bond for $1 billion with proceeds committed to fund additional renewable energy purchases. Net unsecured debt was also impacted by payments of approximately $270 million related to clearance of our C-band spectrum licenses, which are now substantially complete. While these payments do not affect our free cash flow, they are use of cash.\nOur net unsecured debt consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x, in line with the previous quarter. Given the strength and momentum of our business, we continue to see a clear path to meaningfully delever the balance sheet in the second half of this year.\nIn closing, I'm happy with our start to 2024, and our results from the first quarter set us up well to deliver on our financial guidance for the year. Our disciplined approach continues to put us in a strong position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Our focus remains on driving operational improvements throughout the year.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before opening the call up for your questions.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Tony. I'm proud of our team and pleased with our financial and operational performance in the first quarter. We exited the quarter with good momentum across the business, positioning us well for the year ahead.\nWe're gaining fixed wireless access and private networks while growing our core mobility business. Our disciplined, targeted and segmented Consumer strategy continues to prove itself. And we will apply the same level of energy and execution to the prepaid market.\nNetwork excellence drives our business forward, and we will not let up on that. Our consistent network investment puts us in an unmatched position to deliver AI services at scale.\nFinally, our cash flow generation is solid. This shows that we are executing well against our financial objectives. Our cash flow strength allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, including supporting our dividend and paying down our debt. With strong momentum already in the start of the second quarter, I'm confident in our ability to sustain progress towards unlocking Verizon's full potential for all stakeholders.\nNow, Brady, we are ready to take questions.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.",

Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on slide two of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nEarlier this morning we posted to our investor relations website a detailed review of our Q4 and full year results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our investor relations website. We'd like to note that Verizon's Q4 reporting earnings per share were negatively impacted by a number of special items which are discussed in the written remarks available on our investor relations website. The largest of the impacts was also disclosed in our 8K filing last Wednesday. Excluding these special items, adjusted EPS for the Q4 was $1.08. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 2023 earnings call. I hope you all had a great start of 2024. I'm pleased to report that Verizon closed out the year with a strong Q4, finishing off a year of solid operation and financial performance. For us, 2023 was a year of continuous improvement and important actions across the business. We made significant changes to how we operate and to our team, and those changes paid off. We stabilized our core business and positioned the company for renewed growth and profitability. We built strong momentum quarter after quarter, culminating in a very good holiday season.\nAnd finally, we met the guidance that we provided to you in each of our key performance indicators. Entering 2024, Verizon stands ready to further unlock our performance potential at an accelerating rate.\nWe now have all the assets, the best team in the business, and a focus on continued operational excellence to deliver even better results going forward. Let me share some full year highlights with you. Wireless Service revenue for 2023 was $76.7 billion, a 3.2% year-over-year increase. We delivered outstanding volumes during a healthy Q4 where our customers clearly embraced our offerings. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $47.8 billion, contributing to a very strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion, reflecting our disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth.\nAs a result of our financial strength, we raised our dividend for the 17th year in a row with a healthy free cash flow dividend payout ratio of approximately 59%. We also reduced our year-over-year leverage while continuing to bring CapEx back towards business as usual levels.\nThis aligns with the capital allocation priorities we have shared in recent years. These results provide a solid foundation for Verizon's journey and future success, and I'm pleased that we put a leadership team in place last year that will serve Verizon stakeholders well in both the short and long term. We as a team have focused on capturing the market opportunity, and I'm proud of our progress in 2023. Just two weeks ago, Leslie Berland joined Verizon as our Chief Marketing Officer.\nI'm excited to bring her on board and have great confidence in her ability to continue shaping Verizon's premium brand perception and story. We started 2023 determined to differentiate ourselves by investing even more in profitable growth while transforming Verizon to make the company more efficient and effective.\nSeeing the continued strength of the US consumer, busy holiday store traffic, and rising demand for mobility, broadband, and private networks. We also took actions to fuel growth during the Q4 and it showed in our results. A standout milestone in 2023 was our launch of myPlan, which was designed from extensive customer research to be the most flexible plan available to US consumers from any wireless company. myPlan has been a great success that has seen stellar adoption introduced in May. We already have 13.1 million myPlan subscribers and these customers using premium packages and our unique perks driving ARPA.\nOther changes we made in 2023 include establishing a regional distribution model, tailoring our approach to every market, revamping sales composition to support productivity, and introducing new price plans and promotions in consumer and business.\nVerizon Business also partnered with HCLTech to be more efficient to deliver post-sale implementation and customer support for managed network services, enhancing our customer service while saving Verizon money. These actions paired with all of our assets set us up very well for 2024. We are now working from an effective model and this is just the start. Overall, the wireless industry is strong as we head into 2024 and we are confident in our strategy. We have great offerings with optionality to meet the needs of customers of any budget on the best network in the country.\nNow let me share a bit more how each of our service performed in the Q4. Starting with mobility, we had 449,000 postpaid phone net adds driven by improving net adds in consumer, and a continued sustainable performance in Verizon Business.\nOur disciplined and segmented market approach is working with customers and creating great economics for our shareholders in consumer. You can see the pattern of continuous improvements from the start of the year. In the Q4, we delivered our best postpaid phone gross adds performance since 2019, and our best net adds in two years. We added 318,000 postpaid phone customers in the Q4, and our gross adds were up almost 17% year-over-year. It is clear that we have momentum in consumer as we move into 2024, and we will continue to work to get our fair share on new business. Our customer centric offers are resonating in the market, and we're just getting started.\nBy leveraging Verizon's large subscriber base and key partnership, we can deliver exclusive discount offers like Netflix and Max for just $10 a month, underscoring our industry leadership in value driven content offerings. With our vast network coverage and the largest base of loyal customers, we're uniquely positioned to provide targeted high value deals that deepen relationship across connected devices, streaming, and more within the value business, which includes our prepaid offerings like TracFone, Visible, and Total by Verizon. We still have work to do but are making progress moving to Verizon Business.\nThe team continued to deliver on mobility with total postpaid phone net adds of 131,000 for Q4 2023, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125,000. For the full year, business added 562,000 phone net adds, an outstanding result.\nOur business customers are prioritizing mobility and value the optionality we offer with highly tailored plans on the best network in the country. Now let's turn to broadband. For the year we had more than 1.7 million broadband net adds with more than 1.5 million net adds from fixed wireless access and 248,000 net adds from Fios, a nice increase over 2022 on fixed wireless access. We're consistently adding more than 350,000 subscribers per quarter, which is part of our plan for steady sustainable growth that exceeds what we expected at launch.\nJust three years after launch we served more than 3 million fixed wireless access customers, well ahead of our stated goal of 4 to 5 million subscribers by the end of 2025. With fixed wireless access, we're expanding into new markets and proving the value of Verizon's connectivity.\nCustomers are finding strong reliability and speed in fixed wireless access, and that shows in our results, including a very strong net promoter score for a product that still is in the beginning. The pace of adoption has the team super excited. We expect this will be a long term source of recurring revenue for Verizon, and we're entering this year with a strong base for continued growth.\nTurning to the private networks and our 5G business solutions, we continue to see interest from large enterprises running complex logistics and operations like ports, automotive, and heavy industries. In November, Norfolk International Terminals contracted us to build a second private 5G network for them. Audi, already one of our partners in smart car development, has contracted us to build a private network for their automotive tech testing environment.\nNucor, one of the country's largest steel companies, has us building private networks for three of its sites, with more to come over the next year. Strategically, we're building a new source of revenue expansion where we are the clear leader. Last year we also expanded existing 5G private networks partnerships with NFL to bring new spectator and retail experience to fans everywhere. When we build relationships with these large enterprises and they see what our network can do for them. There is always potential for more business and our network is just getting better and better every day with full access to our spectrum as of the end of Q3 last year.\nOur mission is to optimize the experience in every market and expand into suburban and rural markets where we know our consumer and business customers are eager to take up our offerings.\nWe have been expanding and improving our network in key markets through 2023 and into this year. I have said it before and I will say it again, our network is the foundation, how we offer the best value and premium experience to our customers, and we're now seeing our investment in C-Band paying off in terms of customer experience and loyalty. Where we have C-Band, we see higher gross adds, lower churn, and more step-ups to premium services. We also see increased uptake of customers taking both mobility and broadband services.\nMeanwhile, Millimeter Wave, which we have now deployed in many urban areas and all 30 NFL stadiums, sets Verizon apart with an outstanding performance at high-density areas and public event spaces.\nFor the 32nd consecutive time, Verizon was the most awarded company in the country for wireless network quality with the first place rankings in each of the J.D. Power's six regions. We are a network that America relies on and we take that commitment very seriously. Looking ahead, our priorities for 2024 are crystal clear. We remain laser focused on growing wider service revenue and expanding our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to allow for our meaningful debt reduction in the year ahead. This is what our whole team is working towards and what you, our shareholders, and our board want us to focus on.\nTony will have more details for you, but we anticipate strong wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024, which reflects our ability to sustain the top line of our business as we continue to pursue the right balance of profitability and customer growth. Our adjusted EBITDA profile will continue to improve as we become even more efficient with growth, cost-saving measures, and our disciplined promotional spending. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, and as we lower our capital intensity from the C-Band build out and our new business structure, we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation going forward.\nThat will enable our board to continue to raise our dividend and also enable us to bring down leverage. Now Tony will discuss the quarter as well as our operations and guidance in more detail.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks Hans and good morning. Executing on our plan, we finished the year strong and delivered on our financial guidance. We exited the year with good momentum and remain committed to our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. In 2023, we set out to improve our operational performance while sustaining financial discipline. Our Q4 and full year results confirm that our strategy is working and that we can deliver strong financials and improve key operating metrics.\nConsumer postpaid phone net adds totaled 318,000 for the quarter, a substantial improvement of 369,000 sequentially and 277,000 compared to the prior year. Our consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.88% represents a stable result even after we implemented over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023. While we do not provide specific guidance on volumes, we wanted to share a couple of items.\nAs we look into 2024 in Q1, we are taking additional targeted pricing actions that we expect will result in incremental pressure on consumer postpaid phone churn in the period. However, we expect to deliver positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in full year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined. Postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter were up nearly 17% year-over-year. This represents our best quarterly consumer gross adds performance in four years. Our attractive myPlan offers combined with our segmented approach to the market, regional sales structure, and disciplined promotional strategy continued to deliver strong results.\nAdditionally, postpaid upgrades remained lower as compared to the prior year. The consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4% in Q4, down 120 basis points year-over-year as a result of approximately 19% fewer upgrades.\nAs Hans said, we continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band in our first 76 C-Band markets. Q4 consumer postpaid phone gross adds growth was 8 percentage points better than in non C-Band markets. Additionally, consumer postpaid phone churn in C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption.\nThe premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year.\nThis was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption, and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024. Our prepaid results remain challenged in the Q4. This is in part to seasonally weaker national retail sales volumes, which is the primary sales channel for our TracFone brands. We also continue to see pricing pressures from low-end postpaid offerings. Prepaid net losses for the quarter were 289,000. During the quarter. We saw continued strong growth within the Visible and Total by Verizon brands, which we will continue to scale.\nThe team is also focused on our partnerships to improve the performance of the Straight Talk brand. We believe we're taking the right steps to better position our offerings in the market and expect to see some stabilization in 2024.\nVerizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 131,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned is our 10th consecutive quarter above 125,000. The Business Markets Group had its best phone net add performance in the last two years, demonstrating how our value proposition is resonating with small and medium businesses. Similar to consumer, we are taking pricing actions in the first quarter in Business that could result in elevated phone churn in the period. However, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong Business volumes in 2024. Moving on to broadband, we delivered 413,000 net additions in the quarter, continuing the pace of over 400,000 broadband net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter.\nWe see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless offerings, and we continue to see positive responses from customers regarding the quality, reliability of our services in fixed wireless.\nWe delivered 375,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to over 3 million subscribers. We launched C-Band in early 2022, and our fixed wireless success in the last two years reflects the strong demand for high-quality broadband and the strength and reliability of our product. Notably, in the Q4, over 80% of our consumer fixed wireless gross adds came from C-Band markets. The growth trajectory for fixed wireless continues to be robust, and we are ahead of schedule to achieve our 4 to 5 million subscriber goal by year-end 2025. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, down 4,000 year-over-year. We are pleased with the success of Fios with strong gross adds and retention reflecting the quality and overall value of the product.\nWe expect broadband subscriber momentum to extend into 2024 as we continue deployment of our C-Band spectrum, further expand our Fios footprint, and bring new products and offers to the market. Let's now look at our financials.\nConsolidated revenue for the Q4 was.\n$35.1 billion down 0.3% year-over-year. This change can be attributed to the wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 2% lower than the prior year as total postpaid upgrades declined by approximately 18%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.4 billion, up 3.2% year-over-year. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans, and growth in fixed wireless access. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year as well as promo amortization. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $11.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the prior year.\nHigher wireless service revenue and the benefits of lower upgrades were more than offset by higher marketing and bad debt expense and ongoing declines in business wireline revenue. adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% was relatively flat year-over-year.\nIn 2023, we implemented transformations within our consumer customer care group as well as business managed services. We are pleased with what we have achieved this year, and our cost saving measures are meeting our expectations. We expect further progress on our cost efficiency program in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 in the quarter, resulting in full year adjusted EPS of $4.71. Turning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the Q4 was $8.7 billion, bringing the total for 2023 to $37.5 billion.\nThis marks a year-over-year improvement of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.6 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the prior year. The full year CapEx totaled $18.8 billion, which represents a more than $4 billion reduction in capital spending from 2022.\nAs we come down from our peak C-Band spending level, free cash flow for the Q4 was $4.1 billion, bringing our year to date total to $18.7 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over the prior year driven by operational improvements and the lower CapEx spending that we previously noted. We are pleased to have delivered on our guidance of more than $18 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which reflects our balanced and strategic approach to delivering profitable growth. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.4 billion, a $1.6 billion improvement year-over-year. Net unsecured debt increased sequentially primarily due to settling the $3.7 billion in incentive payments to satellite operators for our remaining C-Band spectrum.\nOur net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the Q4, in line with the prior two quarters. We expect deleveraging of the balance sheet to accelerate in 2024 as CapEx comes down to BAU levels and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our approach to managing long-term debt and have only $3.6 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2024. Overall, I'm pleased with our momentum exiting the year and our performance in 2023, delivering an improved operational profile while also meeting our financial guidance.\nNow I want to take a few moments to look ahead and walk through our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 guidance demonstrates our expectations for accelerating wireless service revenue growth.\nAs a reminder, the reported 2023 wireless service revenue growth of 3.2% included approximately 190 basis points of benefit from a reallocation of other revenues. Excluding this reallocation, the 2023 wireless service revenue growth was 1.3%. For 2024, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 3.5%. This will be driven by anticipated positive postpaid phone net additions of both consumer and business, continued fixed wireless access subscriber growth, further adoption of premium unlimited plans, growth in products and services, and pricing action benefits.\nWe expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to grow by 1% to 3% versus the prior year. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue and the impact of our cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in business wireline revenues and increased wireless network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.50 to 4.70.\nAs noted, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in 2024, offset by certain below the line impacts. Specifically, higher interest expense is expected to impact adjusted EPS by $0.16 to 0.19, over 75% of which is driven by the continued reduction in and capitalized interest related to the C-Band licenses being placed into service. In addition, EPS is expected to be impacted by approximately $0.07 to 0.09 of higher pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to the expiration of certain credits.\nThis impact will flow through the other income and expense line on our income statement. We expect depreciation amortization to be relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24% based on current legislation.\nAs discussed in prior quarters, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17 and $17.5 billion, down from $18.8 billion in 2023. While we are not providing guidance on 2024 free cash flow, we wanted to provide some additional color to aid with your analysis. Tailwinds to free cash flow will come from our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook as well as the expected $1.5 billion reduction in CapEx in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guided CapEx range. Offsets will be higher interest expense and higher cash taxes. As a reminder, the majority of the higher interest expense relates to reductions in capitalized interest.\nSuch interest was recognized in cash flow from investing prior to placing the C-Band spectrum into service. The higher cash taxes are primarily related to the continued phase out of bonus depreciation in 2024 based on current legislation.\nOverall, we expect a strong free cash flow profile that will support our capital allocation priorities and position us for meaningful unsecured debt reduction in 2024, which we expect to come in the latter half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans for his closing thoughts.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Tony. As you heard today, we are confident and well positioned to deliver a solid 2024 thanks to our best-in-class network, which is only getting better. We offer the mobile and broadband services that customers value and need the most. Our industry is critical to the next wave of innovation, and Verizon is ready to capitalize on the opportunity of the AI economy to bring this technology to life for all our stakeholders. As I said in the beginning, we have the right team in place to execute the next chapter in Verizon's history. I'm proud of the work our team accomplished in 2023, and I'm excited about what we will deliver in 2024.\nOur results in C-Band market speaks for themselves and support our investment decisions, and we're going to lean in further as we expand into suburban and rural markets while maintaining the financial discipline you come to expect from us. We will continue to stay very close to our customers to understand their needs and preferences so that we can offer the right promotions at the right times in the right markets. We have the right people, the right assets, and the right strategy.\nOur focus for 2024 is on execution. It's a winning combination, and we are very confident heading into this year. Finally, I want to remind you that we are hosting an investor event on 5 February 2024 and encourage everyone to tune in to the webcast.\nGiven the financial update today, next month will be more of an operational and strategic update on the company. Now, Brady, we are ready to take questions.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly. When prompted, your name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your request, please press star two. One moment for the first question.\nThe first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, guys. I'd love to drill down onto a couple of things. Firstly, the sub-trends. 17% growth is some real momentum. I know Hans, you talked about a number of sort of potential drivers. But if there's anything you could.\nBe specific and sort of talk about what drove that in the quarter, and is that likely to continue? Also, the account growth, is that likely to continue? And then, you talked about some churn on the price increase. Anything you could say about sort of the net add momentum as we look into 2024? That's first, and maybe for Tony. Nice service revenue growth. Any additional info you can to give us to sort of unpack that in terms of the price increase impact versus last year, and what you're seeing in terms of tiering, that'd be great, thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nHey John, thank you for the question. So let me start about the subs then on the business side, 10th quarter in a row more than 125,000. Kyle and the team is doing a great job. Our network is performing so well, so our customers just continue to buy in with us. Not only that, our offerings and our go to market is as strong as ever. So we feel really good about what Kyle and the team is doing on the consumer side. Yeah, we had a good Q4, but you have seen also through the year that we have sequentially improved all the time. Everything started where we started with a new offering, myPlan, which resonates with the market very much. Consumer insights in it.\nThen, on top of that, Sampath has done a lot of changes in our structure all the way from the go to market. The incentives in our stores and our decentralization of it. So it hangs together all the way. So I think the most important we have the right offerings in the market and that has really resonated on the consumer side. So I'm really happy with the team. We will continue to execute on the plan we have and we are started.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nHey John, it's Tony. Good morning. So just to add on to what Hans mentioned, we did really well in Tier 1 markets, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about 8 percentage points better. And we were also net add positive in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. You know, we improved our competitive positioning against all providers. You know, we continue to build out C-Band as we said earlier, and in suburban and rural markets, and we see further opportunity there. And as Hans mentioned, we had strong momentum in the VBG side as well on both mobility and FWA.\nSo good results. And then on your question on service revenue, so we feel really good about the shape of service revenue in 2024. The guidance that we gave of 2% to 3.5% reflects accelerated growth.\nWe talked about the jump off point of 1.3% in the prepared remarks. The midpoint of our guidance range implies over $2 billion of service revenue growth. If we think about the assumptions in the guide, in terms of tailwinds, as you know, we've executed a number of pricing actions both in the back half of 2023 that do carry into 2024 as well as in recent weeks. We've taken further pricing actions in both consumer and business that will provide a tailwind.\nWe also have an improving volume profile in our consumer business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in consumer in 2024 and stable business volumes as well. The third tailwind I'd point to is an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. We have really good momentum and over 3 million subs in the base.\nIn terms of headwinds, prepaid has been a drag on service revenue both in the Q4 and the full year, was about $142 million in the Q4. We expect the prepaid headwinds to continue into 2024 as we stabilize that business. Then on promo amortization, that continues to be a headwind with the increase in 2024 similar to the increase we experienced in 2023. But when you put that all together, we like the trajectory of service revenue.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nThat's great detail. Thanks, guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much.\nGood morning.\nJust following up there on the fixed wireless. Could you just give us a little.\nBit of color around how the churn is performing?\nWhat are you seeing in terms of.\nThose cohorts that have had this service for some time and any comments on sort of capacity and so forth? Also, are you seeing emerging seasonality in this product driven by strong back to school in Q3 and then maybe a little bit softer in Q4? Anything you can color you can provide on your exposure to ACP and how that may affect you, and your latest thoughts on the BEAD Program. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nOkay, thank you. On the fixed wireless access, I think the product is maturing. We're now past 3 million subs both on the business side and consumer together. Clearly.\nThe rollout and the product is unique. It resonates so good in the market, the simplicity of the product and installing it.\nWhich was our idea. Even if we took out the discount that we had in the Q3, we haven't seen any slowdown. The product is resonating so well. We are constantly improving it. The NPS is really high on the product, and as I said so many times before, for us it is to keep the same volume right now because we are dimensioning our capacity or capital in the best way. It's the most efficient way. We will continue to be in these levels, and we think they're very important. Important. Topping that, of course, our consumers using fixed wireless access are using the network as anybody else. As I said before, we have dimensioned the network to handle it, so that's not the challenge.\nThe most important for us is that we are fiberized with our network, so we can transport all the data. The guys are doing a great job on fixed wireless access across the board.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah. Just one additional point there. The longer dated Char and Simon is very strong, and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. On your other question on ACP, just maybe a few points to make here. The guidance assumes that the ACP funding remains intact. In the event the funding goes away, we have plans to address it, and we'll see what happens there. The majority of the exposure on ACP is in our prepaid business. We have about 1.2 million prepaid subs that benefit from the ACP program, and that's less than 10% of our prepaid base. On the postpaid side, we have minimal exposure to ACP, both Fios and postpaid wireless, and the margin exposure from ACP is very, very small.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nOn the BEAD Program, we will participate when that comes out in the market where we see we can compete and where we see a good return on investment. We have already won a couple in the early stages, and we expect that this will roll out over years to come. Again, we will see that we participate when it makes sense for us, always with financial discipline.\nGreat.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nJust one follow up on the fiber build, is that again, about 500,000 homes passed this year.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nYes, Simon, will be a little bit over 400,000 next year.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks so much.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. I think you said you expect postpaid phone positive for the year. What's the durability of consumer growth? Could that also be positive for 2024, and remind us the impact that price increases tend to have on churn over the last couple of years? Second, maybe you could just dig into where your gross adds are coming from, the improvements as you're doing better there. Churn has sort of been in line, but gross adds doing a lot better. You could dig into that. Is there any significant shift in where customers are coming from, maybe from myPlan?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nSure. Can you start by saying, but I'm going to hand it over to Tony. I think you're spot on myPlan. I said it in my opening remarks. You know, stellar performance so far on myPlan. It's not only that the plan is good, it's both flexible. You have cost control, and our customers get value of it. I think that goes back to what I talked about for years. Disciplined approach, but also very segmented. That's what's happening right now. We can see that we allocate money to the right product, to the right customer, in the right market. There's a lot of that. Tony will give you a little bit to run down on the numbers.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nSure. Phil, on the churn, I mean, obviously we'll see a little bit of an uptick from the pricing changes we made in both consumer and in business. Those changes were announced in the last few weeks. As Hans mentioned, we really had good performance in consumer. You saw the gross add number at 17% and 10% for the full year, and that's despite being in a much lower upgrade environment as well. We feel really good. Like I said earlier, the tier one markets were very strong, and we see further opportunity as we build out C-Band. The churn profile is much better. The ARPA is much better. We're very comfortable with what we're seeing so far with C-Band and the performance.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nIn terms of the durability of postpaid and growth there.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, look, we said we're going to be postpaid phone positive in consumer in 2024, and we'll also continue to see strong momentum in business as well. We did 562,000 net adds this year, and Kyle and the team did a great job, and we expect continued solid growth from the business side as well.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThat's great. Thanks for everything, guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\nJust one more on wireless pricing. Can you provide some additional context on.\nHow you're seeing the competitive landscape evolve.\nWith respect to pricing and how Verizon is trying to balance the volume versus.\nPrice equation as you look out from the recent pricing actions that you've taken?\nCan you provide an update on how much the cost cutting.\nProgram yielded in 2023 and how much.\nYou can capture in 2024 relative to.\nThe previously articulated target?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Mike. I think when it comes to our pricing and our promotions, I think we look more about we are the leader in the market. We look at the different segments. We have to see that we have the right offerings for our right customer with the right value. That's the focus we have had for, I would say, the last two years, very much focused on our customer base, the consumers, and the customers we can attract. Verizon and so far that disciplined approach we have.\nYou saw the Q4, for example, we invested a little bit more because we have really good momentum. Sometimes we're going to invest more, but it's always going to be with a return on investment in mind to see that we're doing the right for all our stakeholders.\nThat's the focus we have on the pricing we have both on broadband and on wireless. On the cost program, 2023 was a big year for us. You probably follow all our press releases, but we did a lot in customer care. We did a lot with managed services. With outsourcing to HCL, we implemented some really large IT systems and applications that's going to be a fantastic platform. We continue to deploy our offshore centers and are being even stronger using that as a platform on the basis that we created the Verizon Global Services on 1 January 2023.\nI'm really pleased with the platforms, and that means we're on track for the savings we talked about going into 2024. It's more about the same, Tony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nSure. Just to add a couple of things here, on 2023 we delivered about $300 to 400 million in savings. As Hans mentioned, we expect the program to ramp in 2024, and the savings are contemplated in the guide. A portion will hit the bottom line, while also giving us the flexibility to invest in the business. I think you saw that in the Q4, and the results speak for themselves. We're not going to give specific cost targets. You know, in addition to what Hans mentioned, we have work going on in IT, platform transformation, real estate and fleet optimization, and we're also opening up a shared service center in Ireland.\nWe feel really good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you see in the guidance for this year.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nJust one other, where are you in the process of restructuring the business, wireline operations, and how close are you to an inflection where that segment can stabilize financially or potentially eventually grow at some point? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Mike. No, that's a big focus for us. We have the secular decline, and we've had that for quite a while. There's nothing new and nothing new to that story. Our cost efficiency is, of course, happening very, very quickly, and the team is doing a great job. Not only that, we also see that we have the right pricing for our customers, and also, where we don't have great contracts, we have decided to walk away from them. Very much blocking and tackling to see that we continue to improve.\nOf course, our target is to get that to sort of being neutral to our P&L over time. That is one of the important pieces for getting the 25% of the Verizon Business Group in EBITDA. Not only that, we're offsetting that by growing our wireless business and our broadband business. Typical management of a product portfolio. I would say Kyle and the team is doing a great job with the full support from Tony and me.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\nPlease go ahead, sir.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you. You made a lot of changes in the last year to kind of retail marketing, to correct some of the past periods. You now got a new CMO. What can we expect her to be doing differently? Should we see this as another reset or change of direction? How should we think about that adjustment? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nYou're right. Last year we did a lot of changes, but looking at the result, I think many of the changes were absolutely right all the way from our structural changes to go to market to products. Also, we did quite a lot of management changes, getting many of the executives in new positions, including then recruiting a new CMO in Leslie Berland. We're excited to have her on. I think where we are with our brand and with our offerings, we're in a great place. You know, you cannot sit still here.\nThat's why we recruited Leslie. Leslie will work with the full team to see how we continue to refine the leadership in the brand, because we are the number one brand in the market. We're just going to refine that, but we're not going to sit still, you know.\nI think Leslie has been over two weeks, so I see a lot of great initiatives and ideas, and we will work together with her to make this company even better.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nOkay, great.\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Frank. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys, thanks for taking the questions, a couple. If I could just. The first, you know, you went out of your way to highlight how well fixed wireless access is doing in the C-Band markets. You know, these are kind of the main markets, probably the densest markets. Obviously, we're going to see the C-Band deployment expand both in terms of spectrum density and in terms of geography. You know, 350 has been kind of the baseline expectation for fixed process adds in the current C-Band deployment. Would you be willing to put a stake in the ground? You know, where could that go?\nCould that double by the time we get the full C-Band deployment out there by the end of next year? That's the first question. I guess the second question, Tony, you gave us the kind of moving parts.\nThe EBITDA growth 2%, that's about $750 million after tax. Interest expense at $0.175. That's about $750 million after tax, $1.5 billion CapEx savings. The big moving part that none of us really know is the cash tax and how that might impact free cash flow, whether free cash flow could be up a little bit, down a little bit. Could you be more transparent around that moving part? Thank you so much.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, David. When it comes to fixed wireless access.\nWhen we got the C-Band, the initial chunk of spectrum we got was in urban places. Now, since the end of Q3, we got the suburban and rural areas. We continue at the end of the year.\nTo strengthen our urban area. Now we are sort of deploying much more in the suburban and rural. That creates a new opportunity for us both from our strength in wireless in many of those markets together with our fixed wireless access. I said it many times before, for us, it's very important to have a certain volume and a certain cadence because we can optimize our resources, our capital, etc. Tony and I feel really good about being around 400,000 net adds for broadband in total, including Fios. That has sort of been a mantra. They can be, of course, coming up and down a little bit, but it's not like we are forcing a lot of capital and resources in a quarter and then doing less next. That's not efficient in a company like ours.\nWe are very financially disciplined, as you know, and that's best for our customers and for our stakeholders, like shareholders. That's what you're going to expect from us.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nDave, just on your question on cash taxes, we said, you know, we're going to be pressured by the phase out of bonus. You know, we did see a tax benefit in 2023 from the spectrum clearing payments, and if you think about the headwind, we'd see it at about $2 billion right now. We'll have to see how things play out with what the proposed legislation is.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nPerfect.\nHelpful, guys. Thank you so much.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nYes. Hi. I wonder if you could talk about your market growth expectations for postpaid coming into the year. I know you're the first one to report, so we haven't seen the results from anyone else yet. What's your sense of what we can expect in terms of total postpaid and maybe total phone growth for 2024 market wide?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Craig. If I think about this year, first of all, mobility and broadband is two of the most important infrastructure in the country. I don't think anyone, company, person, organization can live without those services. We are the number one in basically everything we're doing. I think it's a healthy industry. It's an important, important product we have, and it can come up and down. I cannot give you a percentage what's going to happen. I think our offering is great.\nI think the product is so important, both mobility and broadband for all parts of our society. I wouldn't like to be in any other business than this. It's sort of so important for our society that mobility and broadband is working.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nCan I just maybe drill down a little bit though? I mean, the growth numbers we've seen have been as high as 6+ million.\nIs that a feasible growth rate? Population growth including immigration is more like 3 million.\nIs your sense as you go in to set your own expectations for the year that we'll see some deceleration, or is your sense that there's still something going on that's keeping growth so far in excess of population growth?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nI think that we're going to, whatever number it is going to be, we're going to get our fair share of it, and that's what we are aiming for. You're right, of course, immigration is lower, so the pool is smaller. We've also seen a really good uptake between value segment to postpaid, so there are a lot of factors coming in. Of course, what we have done, and think about offerings we have where myPlan, we're adding the perks, for example, Netflix and Max, we are expanding also ARPA because we have such a great offering to our customers. This is a new time. Again, the product is so important for the market and for each and every one of us.\nI feel really good about coming into this year, what we have done, and where we go to, and let's see where we end up.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Craig. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar",
    "content2": "Managing Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Maybe a couple, I guess. Firstly on the fiber side, Hans, as you think about the base of fixed wireless subscribers, by next year you'll have a pretty big critical mass overall of 5+ million, potentially.\nIt's not too far away from where your Fios basis is, and you have [inaudible] money coming in. Potentially, there's more interest from private equity funds and so on and so forth. I know you've talked about being a lot more disciplined on fiber, but does your breakeven threshold change just given the kind of critical mass you get to in fixed wireless and also the kind of capital alternatives that we are starting to see in the market? That's one. Secondly, on the wireless side, over the last two or three years, obviously there's been a pretty big tailwind to service revenue from prices and explicit price increases.\nYour thoughts on how long that can continue and when does mix take over and become a bigger component overall from a service revenue growth perspective, and how we should expect that transition to happen would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Kannan. I have to go back a little bit when it comes to our broadband strategy. We have a multipurpose network. We build the networks once, and we have multiple options at the edge. That was sort of the infancy of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. From the data center to the edge, we have harmonized everything. We have fiber in between everything. We have multi routers. We have one transport network that is super important. It's sort of the brain of the network. At the edge, we have optionality. What type of.\nAccess we have in the ILEC. Of course, we're going to continue with our success in Fios, and outside we're doing fixed wireless access. It gives us optionality over time. You know, I like owner's economics. I think that makes us very competitive in pricing and offerings to our customers. There are, of course, a lot of offerings from people that want to chip in capital. Ultimately, it has paid off for us to be very, very prudent and financially disciplined with our own money. You know, you can never outrule.\nThat's really my view on it. I'm creating optionality with the network, and Joe and his team are super agile if we need to be within that. On the wireless, I would say, I mean, if you look at our business side.\nThey have great offerings in the market. They're taking the fair share of it, 10 quarters, and then have also made new offerings so they can expand. I think they both have done quantity.\nValue and wireless. Of course, on the consumer side, they have historically had more ARPA.\nIncrease with new offerings, new pricing, new products rather than volumes. You have seen us performing in the last part of the year. I think Sampath and his team, they have said that they want to increase the part of getting new customers. Again, it will be financial discipline and we should get the right customers. If you look at our quality of our consumer base, it's just amazing. We will continue to be financially prudent on that. Clearly, we want to have more volumes, but not to any cost. We will do it with the right cost and the right product to our customers.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Kannan. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. On the subject of consumption and network utilization, I wondered if you could update us on the number of gigabytes per month that postpaid phone customers are consuming nowadays and, extending that thought, over the next few years. Does that growth and the robust FWA business that you're building suggest that we should prepare for densification, or other radio access network, or spectrum costs for capacity over the next several years? Certainly not a 2024 question. Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, I go back to how we build the network because building the network is so important because the biggest challenge with a lot of traffic is of course transporting it in an efficient way, having your own fiber, and that we've already built. When it comes to the growth in the network, yeah, everybody's using the network more. It's no different within fixed wireless access and Fios. And of course wireless consumers are using the network more as well. But we have built a very stable network all the way from the data centers to the edge.\nAnd then of course we have assets that nobody else has. We have a lot of our traffic on millimeter wave, which is the cheapest way to deliver data in the market by far. And we have our C-Band just coming out, and we have our best engineers.\nI feel really good with that. People are and customers are using our network more. That's what this was intended for and we have designed it like that.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nGreat. Thanks, Peter. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. I had two, if I could. First, following up on John's earlier question, can you give us a sense for how much of the year-over-year improvement in gross adds in the Q4 was the result of healthy industry volumes versus the improved execution and product that you've got in the market now? And additionally on that, did you see stronger performance in December versus the rest of the quarter?\nI asked because I think your last public presentation was in early December and your results seemed even more positive than your tone back then. So it seems like maybe you picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. And then I just had a separate question on the issue of lead cables.\nI was wondering if you would comment on the latest media report that the EPA has conducted its own testing near some of your lead sheath cables that have shown lead levels above the EPA standard for safety. You know, any sense for whether these reports are accurate, and if so, you know how you're thinking about the potential impact at this point around this issue. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thank you, Brian. Let me start with.\nThe market in Q4. We don't know. I mean the others haven't reported. We only know that we have performed really well. But that has been. It's not the one quarter phenomenon. If you think about from Q2, Q3, even in Q1, we were sequentially improving all the time. And we have done that in a very disciplined way with a lot of actions and that we need to keep up. And then the comment on how the quarter shaped. So you probably talk about consumer more than anything else. I think we're solid through the quarter.\nIt was nothing sort of different during the month in the quarter. We were solid through the quarter, doing well, performance on the lead. As I said before, we take that very seriously. I cannot comment what media are doing.\nWe work with all the agencies to see that we are following this up and.\nWe have revealed all the information we have, so we don't have any more. We have also disclosed how much lead cable we have in the network, which is very little. But again, we take it seriously and work with all the agencies.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Okay, thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. Hey Brad, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nGeneral Partner, LightShed\n\nThanks. Hey Hans, this is, I apologize, probably the fourth time you're coming back to the gross adds question, but I think earlier you made mention of kind of the change in structure from nationalization to localization. I think that was something that Sampath had kind of, you know, stated as one of his specific things and probably something that maybe could be more sustainable than just a change in a rate plan that obviously could be replicated, or just addresses the market.\nSo just a couple questions on that. First, if you think about kind of the ramp in Q4, I know this is kind of a soft question, but like the impact of localization and that's changing the structure of the sales organization versus myPlan, which had the larger impact and then I guess more importantly the sustainability.\nMeaning that yeah, you typically do see sequential growth seasonally around this time of year, obviously more pronounced this year than past. But are we going to see even more sequential growth or more abnormal growth in the first half of the year as some of the implementation of that localization continues? Or have we largely already seen that impact as we go into 2024? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nHey, Walt. Walt. I think that was a good question. So the whole. We started, remember we started with the network as the C-Band is sort of rolling out in different zip codes all the time. We are engaging locally the same we did with the consumer group to be much more local, to be able to do local marketing, cater for what the local market has, have local flavors of our marketing. We worked with a sports league like NFL and the teams in different markets to see that happen. So of course I'm going to attribute part of our growth during the year to the decentralization. But we just got started to see that we have that team in place and Sampath and the team are working with them with these market precedents. But it's also a sign of where the market is going.\nYou need to be local, and you need to be on the ground in the different.\nsocieties in order to perform and be knowledgeable. And Verizon is most visible in all these grounds. And now we're taking the next step with our structure. So, very pleased with what I've seen so far, but more to be done.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, well, just to add on to what Hans said, you know, the regional structure is a lot closer to the customer, and we've run the business this way for many, many years. We can do things like different promos for different markets, and local resources, and decision making. The localization offsets some of the price ups as well. So we feel really good about where we're heading, especially with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 rollouts with C-Band and the opportunity that provides.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nGeneral Partner, LightShed\n\nTony, can you also remind us when the board considers share repurchase as it relates to leverage? And I think the leverage that you mentioned earlier in the call excludes the unsecured debt because you were referencing a 2.6 number. So assuming we're basing it off the 2.6 number, I think your target, your long term target was 2.0. So clearly you wouldn't let it go below 2.0 before you start buying stock back. But is there a consideration under 2.5 where the board starts to consider share repurchase? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Walt. I think this is something that we have been very disciplined. Our capital allocation priorities clear: number one, money to the business, basically our CapEx. Number two, continue to put the board into place where they can continue to increase our dividend. And number three, paying down debt. When we come down to 225, we have said we will start considering buybacks, but our ultimate long-term goal is to get around two. So yes, that's the plan. But of course it will play in where the market is, where the interest rates are, where the capital is, and where our equity is. But clearly that's the plan we have right now and the board is fully tuned to that plan.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nGeneral Partner, LightShed\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, thanks, Walt. Brad, back to you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. To ask a question, press star one on your touch-tone phone. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star two. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on slide two of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results are contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nEarlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our Q3 results. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Brady, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to share our strong Q3 results, making another quarter with solid growth and improving profitability. It is clear that our strategy is working. In both the consumer and the business groups, we're executing a segmented, agile strategy that provides value to our customers and our bottom line. We have delivered growth in each of the areas we asked you to grade us on: wireless service revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. This is evidence that we have the right strategy and are achieving our results in a financially disciplined way. Now, let me share our financials for the quarter. Our Q3 wireless service revenue is up 2.9% year-over-year, driven by expanding and deepening our customer relationships.\nThis revenue growth is a key driver for Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion for the quarter, which is higher than both Q3 last year and sequentially. Our year-to-date Free Cash Flow of $14.6 billion is already exceeding our full-year Free Cash Flow for 2022, thanks to our focus on high-quality revenue growth, disciplined promotion strategy, cost efficiency, and CAPEX reduction of the recent years of heightened capital intensity driven by the C-Band and fiber investments. I'm proud to share that my team and I have taken actions to further our position of financial strength. Our strong cash generation enabled us to reduce net debt, strengthen our balance sheet, and deliver a higher dividend to our shareholders. We're working to bring our leverage ratio to pre-spectrum acquisition levels.\nDuring the Q3, we paid down $2.6 billion in debt and increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year, a current industry record that we take pride in. Our dividend coverage is very healthy. Year to date, our free cash flow dividend payout ratio is approximately 56%, a significant improvement from a year ago. In summary, in spite of an uncertain economic environment, we're on pace to finish 2023 strong. We're confident that we will deliver on the financial guidance that we issued to you at the start of the year, and this morning, are announcing higher free cash flow guidance for 2023. Tony will provide you more details in a few moments. Now, let me share more on how our business units are driving our strategy forward.\nIn the quarter, we delivered on our key growth areas: mobility, broadband, and private networks, thanks to our network scale and technology advantages. In consumer mobility, we achieved sequential and year-over-year improvements in postpaid phone net adds by continuing to put the customer at the center of everything we do. Rather than engaging in aggressive promotional activity like others in the industry, we're offering our consumers optionality and flexibility to choose how they want to use our products and services. Our differentiated approach of segmentation and financial discipline is paying off with growth in postpaid phone gross adds and lower promotional cash costs. There is more work to be done, but our responsible approach positions us to grow subscribers profitably. Since its launch in May, myPlan continues to deliver a personalized experience, giving our customers the value, choice, and control that they want.\nDuring the Q3, we enhanced myPlan by adding Ultimate Unlimited, a third tier with more value and services, further increasing our premium mix and ARPA growth. This is just one example of the flexibility and speed to market that myPlan provides, and I'm excited about what is to come. Our targeted and segmented market approach also served us well during the iPhone 15 launch, and we continue to execute with an eye towards meeting our customers' needs while maintaining a disciplined approach. Our competitive position is now stronger, and we delivered positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in the month of September. We anticipate that momentum will continue as we're on track to exceed our postpaid phone net adds from Q4 of last year. Postpaid phone share and levels are stable, even with our targeted pricing actions throughout the year.\nWe continue to see muted upgrade levels, which is something we're watching carefully, and it's a trend we expect will continue for the next few quarters. Turning to business mobility, Verizon Business Group delivered 151,000 phone net adds and reached our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000. Businesses and governments continue to place an increased emphasis on best-in-class, reliable connectivity that only Verizon provides. Across mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 100,000 compared to 8,000 last year. We are the largest customer base in the industry and are still finding new ways to add customers through innovation, service quality, and a variety of offerings and partnerships that competitors cannot match. As we discussed before, we're seeking the optimal balance between price and quantity that allows us to grow our base profitably. In our value business, we have had negative volumes, but I'm encouraged by our quarter-over-quarter improvements.\nAs I've said before, the value business is a key part of our growth strategy, and we will continue to invest in it and adjust to the needs of the market. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we have seen the bottom for prepaid volumes, and the team is committed and working daily to grow our value business. Moving to broadband, we delivered another strong quarter with more than 400,000 new subscribers for the Q4 in a row. We finished Q3 with 10.3 million broadband subscribers, up by more than 1.7 million subscribers from a year ago, a 21% increase. Critical to the strength of this key area is fixed wireless access, something you know we deeply believe in.\nOur fixed wireless access net adds of 384,000 continue to be strong, even with a recent $10 increase for new bundled customers, further evidence of the demand for our product. Where FWA is available, our customers take it and love it, as seen by the high net promoter score. I'm excited to also share that on the Fios side, we had 72,000 internet net adds for the quarter, up almost 20% year-over-year, and one of our best performances in seven years. Fios remains a coveted, high-quality service, and we continue to take share and deliver strong numbers even in a lower-mover environment. When it comes to private networks, we see demand for the product continue to grow, especially those solutions built with licensed spectrum, which provides a more secure and differentiated experience for the end users.\nBusinesses are increasingly looking to us for the private network solutions, helping to grow our sales funnel and scale the number of installations each quarter. Let me end by talking about the backbone of our business, our network. During Q3, we obtained early access to our remaining C-Band spectrum. In urban markets, where C-Band is already deployed, we're firing on all cylinders and leveraging its full potential through software upgrades, delivering two to three times more spectrum depth. As a result, peak speeds go from 900 Mbps to an amazing 2.4 Gbps, enabling an even better experience for our customers. You've heard me say this before, but let me say it again: C-Band is a game changer for our business, giving us better customer retention and step-up, as well as strong broadband opportunity with fixed wireless access.\nEvery day, we see the benefits of our generational investment in C-Band spectrum and the impact it will have for our customers for years to come. Our network is winning. This quarter, we received J.D. Power Awards in all six US regions, receiving the most awards for wireless network quality for the 31st time in a row. We have the best network in the market, and we will extend our lead as we complete our C-Band deployment, first augmenting urban areas and next year in suburban and rural markets. This is our key differentiator and the center of everything we do, and we're doing all of this in a responsible way. We're optimizing our network while returning to business-as-usual levels of CAPEX. We're finding cost efficiencies across our business, both as a result of our new structure and by emphasizing profitability when evaluating new opportunities like within business wireline.\nOur cost efficiency program remains on track to meet our savings goal of $2 to 3 billion annually by 2025. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the Q3 continue to demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities: growing wireless service revenue, and driving EBITDA and free cash flow. As Hans said, we are executing on our plan and remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We've talked about improving our operational performance while maintaining financial discipline, with the Q3 results representing another proof point that demonstrates we can deliver improving key metrics and strong financials. Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 51,000 for the quarter, an improvement of 85,000 sequentially and 138,000 compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we executed well in a low switcher environment, enabling postpaid phone gross add growth of 2.3% year-over-year. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.85% represents a stable result, even after implementing over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023.\nOur segmented approach to the market and the structure and discipline of our promotional strategy helped to deliver strong postpaid phone gross adds and lower postpaid upgrades. The Q3's consumer upgrade rate of 3.6% is down 150 basis points year-over-year. The quality of the business we are writing in consumer remains high, as myPlan continues to drive an elevated premium mix. Consumer ARPA of $133.47 increased sequentially by 1.2% and year-over-year by 4.5%. We expect to deliver further ARPA growth as a result of the innovations of myPlan, as well as our most recent pricing actions. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 151,000 phone net adds, which, as Hans mentioned, is our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and businesses are more cautious than a year ago, mobility continues to be a top investment priority for our business customers.\nWe expect to continue to deliver strong volumes and expand our relationships by leveraging our position as the wireless market share leader for small and medium businesses, large enterprises, and public sector customers. Moving on to broadband, we delivered 434,000 net additions, continuing the pace of over 400,000 net adds for the Q4 in a row. Customers are drawn to the quality of our service and overall value proposition for both FWA and Fios. For fixed wireless, gross add expansion drove 384,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to nearly 2.7 million subscribers. The addition of the second tranche of C-Band spectrum will help us continue our FWA momentum as we work to build a long-term, sustainable business. Fios internet net adds were 72,000, up 11,000 year-over-year.\nWe're pleased with the success of Fios, with strong gross adds and retention reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. For prepaid, net losses of 207,000 represent the sequential improvement from the Q2. We expect a better trajectory for the remainder of the year as the teams continue to scale some of our key brands, such as Visible and Total by Verizon, and execute on our ongoing integration efforts. Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the Q3 was $33.3 billion, down 2.6% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 12% lower than the prior year, as postpaid upgrades declined 26%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year and up $217 million sequentially. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans, and growth in fixed wireless access.\nAdditionally, as a result of our discipline around promotions and lower upgrade volumes, we saw further reduction in headwinds to service revenue growth associated with promo amortization. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.2 billion, an increase of $267 million sequentially and up 0.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improved wireless service revenue and lower consumer postpaid upgrades. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, were down approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. While bad debt is up year-over-year, it was once again flat sequentially, consistent with the first half of the year.\nWe continue to make progress on our cost efficiency program, having recently implemented transformations within our consumer customer care group, as well as business-managed services. We are on track to deliver $200 to 300 million of savings in 2023, building momentum to generate incremental savings in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.22 and includes $0.03 of pressure from a reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearance of C-Band spectrum. We currently anticipate another incremental $0.03 to 0.04 of pressure in the Q4. Turning the attention to cash flow, cash flow from operating activities for the Q3 was $10.8 billion, bringing the 2023 year-to-date total to $28.8 billion. The year-to-date performance is up approximately $600 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to working capital improvements associated with fewer upgrades and lower inventory levels, partially offset by higher interest payments.\nCustomer payments continue to be healthy, with consistent performance throughout the year. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, totaling $14.2 billion year-to-date. At this point, we expect 2023 CapEx to come in at the upper end of our guidance range of $18.25 to 19.25 billion. Q3 was the second consecutive quarter operating at our business-as-usual run rate. As a result, we would expect a reduction of approximately $4 billion of CapEx in 2023 compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for Q3 was $6.7 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $14.6 billion, a $2.2 billion improvement over the prior year. As Hans mentioned, we have generated more free cash flow in the first three quarters of this year than in all of 2022.\nBased on our year-to-date results and the strength of our core business, we are pleased to raise our 2023 free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. We are raising guidance even with CAPEX at the upper end of our range and absorbing the headwinds from interest expense. Strong free cash flow provides flexibility and enables us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. As Hans said, within the Q3, we executed a successful $2.6 billion debt tender, of which a majority was floating rate, while also increasing our dividend once again. Additionally, given our cash position and the performance of the business, this month we paid approximately $3.7 billion of spectrum clearing costs, primarily using operating cash flow. The remaining spectrum payments are minimal and will be made in 2024.\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.2 billion, an improvement of $4.3 billion from the end of Q2 and $7.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash on hand, which we are using to pay the clearing costs I just described. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the Q3, representing a 0.1-turn improvement year-over-year. Overall, I'm pleased with our ability to deliver stronger operational and financial trends. We are focused on finishing the year strong, with continued improvements in volumes and financials, setting us up for meaningful deleveraging opportunities in 2024. I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Tony. I'm proud of the progress our team has made, and our operating results over the last three quarters should also give you confidence in us. We're delivering on our financial targets ahead of schedule on several key metrics and are restoring our leverage ratios to where we want them to be. We have a great network, and our free cash flow generation is industry-leading, and we have more than 10 million broadband subscribers, and that number is growing at near-record rates. As we enter the final quarter of 2023, our goals are clear: deliver strong growth in wireless service revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. Our segmented and disciplined approach to consumer mobility is working, and we expect our momentum to continue building in the Q4. Enabling all of this is America's best and most reliable 5G network. Our C-Band spectrum has already benefited mobility and broadband.\nDeploying the remaining C-Band will make this network even stronger and more resilient, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Let me close with this: our performance has put us firmly on track to meet our full-year financial targets and position us well as we approach 2024. We're excited to head into 2024 with all of our assets in place and a great team to execute our strategy. With that, I hand the call back to Brady for questions.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. Your name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your request, please press Star two. One moment, please, for the first question. The first question for today will come from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, guys. Thank you. To, if I can, Tony, how should we think about the pieces of free cash flow growing our stability next year? And after making the C-Band relocation payments, what obligations other than the dividend will prevent you from delivering? And then, Hans, as a follow-up, there's a lot of speculation about M&A in the fiber and wireless spaces lately. Can you talk about any interest you have in buying fiber or wireless assets in the market? And if so, what might be criteria for that? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nI was thinking to hand it over to Tony. I mean, first, on the cash flow, I think you have seen us now the last couple of years focusing very much on our service revenue expansion, EBITDA, and cash flow expansion, and all our incentives for the management is set there from the board, both short and long term. So this is a key thing for us to see that we are continuing to generate a lot of cash flow. Tony will talk you through the puts and takes. Regarding fiber assets, first of all, I love our strategy. I mean, our strategy was clear from 2017. In the Fios footprint, of course, we built a lot of fiber, doing extremely well. You saw this quarter again, a record quarter of Fios subscribers. Outside, we built the One Fiber over a couple of years.\nWe're basically in all the major markets. We have One Fiber to our own network. Right now, our strategy is clear that we want to take the broadband subscribers with fixed wireless access because we get them right now. It's a superior product, and we don't see a need right now for adding any fiber to that footprint. Over time, of course, we will always look into it, and anyone that would dispose of any telecommunication assets in the market will talk to us. But the hurdle is high. I mean, we have a great network, and we have built a really good strategy around our technology.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nHi, Phil. Good morning. So on the cash generation, so we're very pleased thus far. I'll start with where we are in the Q3. So we're pleased with the cash generation of the business. The performance of the business, and as you saw, the continued discipline that we had with promos and retention gave us the confidence to raise the free cash flow guide by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. And that's with CapEx at the upper end of the range and also with higher interest expense. So we feel very good about the balance of the year and our positioning heading into next year. Obviously, we're not going to guide on 2024 at this time, but I can share some qualitative aspects as we look ahead to free cash flow for 2024.\nOn the plus side, we continue to focus the team on an improving EBITDA profile, and that's a big focus of the team. With respect to CAPEX, we said a couple of times here in the past that we expect to run at $17 to 17.5 billion for 2024, which is back to a business-as-usual level of spend that you've seen from us. We also strive to make continued improvements in working capital. Offsetting that, we expect higher interest costs from both, in the rate environment, and the reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearing of the C-Band spectrum. With taxes, as you know, under current legislation, taxes are going to be pressured by the continued phase-out of bonus depreciation, and we'll see how that plays out.\nAnd so heading into 2024, we continue to focus on strong free cash flow generation and opportunities for meaningful debt reduction, and we don't see any obstacle to delevering.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks both of you guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah, great. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nTelecom Services Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Good morning. Hans, you talked a lot about fixed wireless. You've got the rest of the C-Band. Can you help update the fixed wireless footprint, the open for sale, and where you are today and how you get to the 50 million households or any updated target that you have there? And then, Tony, you talked a little bit about some of the pricing actions you've taken so far. Can you just tease out for us what you've recognized in Q3 and what I think you've talked about a tailwind going into Q4, so how we think about some of the kind of sequential benefits that are still to come? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nSimon, I can start with fixed wireless access. As you can see, we continue on that rhythm with 354,000 every quarter. The additional C-Band we got just a couple of weeks ago will initially go straight to augmenting our urban areas where we already have the sites. And then in the early part of next year, we will also start deploying that in suburban and rural areas. And of course, that's an even greater opportunity for us because there are more underserved markets, and our fixed wireless access will come extremely quickly into those markets. So that will just fortify our situation and how we want to roll this out. We have a target of 4 to 5 million subscribers by 2025. We keep that. Of course, we have dimensioned our network for way more. And the team, of course, have internal targets that were set by me.\nBut right now, there's nothing else than we want to deliver this target as well to the market. We always want to deliver what we tell the market, and we're going to do that. And then we have a conversation about that when we're past it.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nAnd Simon, on your question on pricing, so a few things here. We executed a number of pricing actions, as you saw. The legacy mix and match that we did earlier in September will yield about $100 million of incremental benefit in the Q4. And we also see improving volumes on mobility and year-over-year improvements there. We also see an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. You saw the growth we had in the quarter with 384,000 net adds. We have 2.7, almost 2.7 million subs in our base, so we feel very good about the momentum there. So very good progress on service revenue and setting us up well for next year.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nTelecom Services Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Hans.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And just two questions. First, on the upgrades, obviously, that number continues to come down. We're solidly into the sort of 3% range. I mean, Hans, in your prepared remarks, you sort of suggested that you expect to see the same for the next few quarters. I guess two questions there. First of all, in your view, what is really driving it? And do you think that this is a temporary issue and that it'll go back to some sort of normalized rate? And then any comments on what that low rate is really doing for your business? And then secondly, in the past, you guys have given some numbers and some metrics on what the C-Band is doing for your business as it gets rolled out. Any update there?\nAre you still seeing improvement in things like gross adds, ARPU churn as you roll that C-Band out? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThanks, John. On the upgrade, as we've seen now for a couple of quarters, when we started our segmented approach on the consumer side, where we actually tried to meet our customers in different segments with the right offerings, that, of course, led to a lower upgrade rate. But as we are not doing a peanut butter spread sort of that everybody gets everything. So we are really trying to see that we have the right offer for our customer. And what is giving me confidence is that our gross adds is just continuing to grow for us. So we have the right offering in the market together with myPlan. Of course, Q4 is always a little bit higher on upgrades because that's normally seasonality. But in general, I see that our model is working, and this is both helping our customers with the right offerings.\nBut not only that, it's helping us with the bottom line and the cash flow generation that we're very focused here at Verizon. And then on the C-Band, we see the same things as we have discussed before. We see lower churn where we deploy C-Band. We see better step-ups or up step-ups in those regions. And then on top of it, we increase fixed wireless access. So there's no difference on that. So I think we same, same, and that's why we're so excited by C-Band continuing to roll out, and we have gotten hold of all C-Band here just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, Hans.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. Coming back to service revenue growth as we're looking ahead into next year and maybe digging a little bit into ARPU drivers. I know you don't report postpaid phone ARPU, but it's clearly an important component of what drives your ARPO. And I was hoping you could give us some insight into how you're thinking about those drivers next year. So for example, do you still see opportunity to make further pricing adjustments in the base? Could you maybe give us some insight into what the mix is looking like? And are you continuing to see the highest-tiered plans being among the most popular? And then are there any headwinds that might be emerging in the ARPU dynamic we need to be taking account for? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nSo let me start on the high level. I mean, first of all, we need to think about our total offering on wireless. We haven't spoken so far much about the business side. But the business side, again, for the ninth quarter in a row, had more than 125,000 phone net adds, actually 150 plus. So they are doing really good in a market where our customers on that side are really looking on the performance of the network and the high-quality distribution we have. So I'm very pleased with that, and I would like to say it. On the consumer side, I think we have found a model with myPlan and how we go to market. All the changes the consumer group and Sampath have done since earlier this year with the plans, decentralization, and sales incentives is helping us to be in the right proposition.\nThen we always look to all the new value added we can give to our customers to broaden the scope for us and for our customers, like we did with the third tier on the network side on myPlan, or that we took away the discount on the convergence within mobility and fixed wireless access in this quarter. So we will continue to look at it, but it's nothing that is the most important right now because I think we have an offering that is really compelling to our customers.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nAnd then, Brett, on your service revenue question, just some qualitative thoughts for you. On the plus side, I would say, look, the pricing actions we took this year obviously have a tailwind in the Q4 and carry over into next year. So we continue to see momentum there. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect an improving volume profile in the consumer business. So that's something that the team is very focused on. Fixed wireless access continues to scale. So as I mentioned earlier, another 384,000 net adds, even as Hans said, and taking away the discount as well. So the momentum is strong there. And continued increased premium mix with myPlan. So myPlan is seeing roughly 70% premium mix, and we're very pleased with the progress there. And we're also seeing some of the headwinds from the promo amortization starting to ease a little bit.\nThat's starting to flatten out, which is good news and also a function of all the discipline that we've had this year. And then offsetting that, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, prepaid continues to be a headwind in the near term as we continue to work to improve the business, and that's still ongoing. So those are the puts and takes in terms of service revenue.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks and good morning. I'm curious if you can unpack the ways in which Verizon will look to achieve its cost-cutting targets through 2025, as well as how much of those benefits could come through in 2024 versus 2025. And then just separately on prepaid, just an update would be great on the integration of TracFone and how Verizon is thinking about the opportunities and timing of potentially taking some of those prepaid customers and migrating them over to your postpaid base. Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Mike. On the cost target, we are definitely on track for delivering on the $2 to 3 million that we talked about when we launched the new structure. The new structure started this year, 1 January 2023. We see a lot of traction on it. Probably as you follow us closely, you have seen that we have worked on the managed services side together with HL. We have done a big transaction on the customer care side. We are doing a lot of transactions on the IT side. We're bringing more AI into the network and to the customer care. It's a lot of things ongoing. So I have a high confidence that we are finding along the road there all the savings we need.\nThe traction is very high in the company on efficiency, given that we have one organization right now, Verizon Global Services, supporting all others to see that we find the best measurements across the company. I can come back to prepaid, and maybe Tony has some more comments on the cost side.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nSure. Thanks. Mike, just a couple of other additional points that Hans mentioned. So we're on track to deliver $2 to 3 billion, as Hans said. $200 to 300 million of that will come this year in 2023 in EBITDA, and that was already contemplated in the guide. Hans mentioned a lot of the initiatives. The other item I would mention is we're being very disciplined in business wireline by de-emphasizing low-margin deals. So that's something that the team is very, very focused on as well. We're not going to give cost targets for 2024 at this time, but we feel good that we have a good foundation that are driving EBIT improvements. You saw it in the quarter with both sequential and year-over-year improvements in EBITDA. That's going to set the foundation for an improving EBITDA profile in 2024.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nOn the value segment in prepaid and TracFone, as we said in the prepared remarks, we were at a low point the first half of 2023, and from here on, we should start sequentially improving. Secondly, this is really important for our strategy. We want to build a network once, have as many connections as possible, and address the entire market on wireless. And of course, being strong and being the number one in the value segment is important. Then from a market point of view, we all know that there has been some sort of blend between the low-end on postpaid and prepaid, which means that the volumes in prepaid is a little bit lower. And we have not been part of that transformation of taking customers for prepaid.\nSo what we're doing right now in our own operation, which is a lot, but one, we're building up Total by Verizon, which is a great speed we have on opening new doors that's going to help us to move up to postpaid for the customers that want to do that, but also have a high-end value proposition. Secondly, we work with the national retailers that we have to see that we are fortifying our offerings in our store. And finally, you're seeing that Visible continues with the pace it has. And then we're working with a lot of other things. So it's a lot of ongoing here that gives us confidence that we will sequentially continue to improve. But clearly, this is very important for our overall strategy.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. I have a question on fixed wireless. There continues to be a lot of debate regarding the sustainability of fixed wireless served by macro cell sites given the trajectory of broadband usage and, of course, the unit economics of radio access networks versus fiber. So really, I guess two questions. One, since you started the fixed wireless deployment, have your assumptions changed at all regarding usage or the number of fixed wireless customers you can optimally load the network with over time? And secondly, what developments have occurred in millimeter wave delivered fixed wireless this year? And how, at this point, are you thinking about millimeter wave evolving over the next couple of years as a scalable access technology? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nHi, Bryan. First, yeah, our assumption has changed on fixed wireless access because our technology has improved more than we thought from the beginning. That means that we can take on even more capacity. We're only on the first inning on the software improvements and our optimization of the network. I think Joe and his team are doing a fantastic job with it. Customers are using it on the consumer side equally much as on the fiber. So there's no difference on usage. I think we have a great path forward with the technology. We are not seeing everything we can do still with the fixed wireless access when it comes to software development, radio improvements, etc. So I have no hesitation over the assumption we made. We're actually having better assumptions today.\nWhen it comes to millimeter wave, that is playing a vital role for us for many reasons. First of all, it takes in all high-density areas. They take the majority of the capacity. That's very important for several reasons. I unleashed the mid-band spectrum in order to have better performance on the street, but also in Fixed Wireless Access. Millimeter wave will continue to play a very vital role. As we've said several times, we build very quickly in all major places. Now we're sort of augmenting where we see a lot of traffic. On top of that, of course, we see opportunities for using our millimeter wave also for MDUs over time to see that we address that market with Fixed Wireless Access.\nSo all in all, we still have a lot of technology evolution to see that we can serve even more customers with even better performance and more capacity. So I'm very happy. And as you've seen on fixed wireless access, our NPS scores are off the chart. I mean, the customer loves it. It's easy. It's quick to deploy. It's self-installed. So I think we hit it clearly with this product. And we're going to push it with our team and see that our customer gets the right products.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you, Hans.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nManaging Director of Telecommunications Services, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Quick question. I apologize if this was addressed. Can you quantify how much of the interest expense going from capitalization to the income statement from the C-Band? And then secondly, where are you as far as being able to utilize the fixed wireless to help reduce costs for type 2 circuits and that sort of thing? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nI can start with the fixed wireless access and Tony will. Yeah, great question. Sometimes we're focused on fixed wireless access being sort of a consumer solution for broadband. Today, we sell a lot of fixed wireless access in the business segment as well, both for large enterprises and for small and medium customers, which has a different usage pattern, which is great. And also we see, and Kyle has discussed that several times, he sees also this is a way of optimizing our access cost by having fixed wireless access as the bearer of transport in many cases. So, clearly, again, this is how we built our network from the beginning to be able, from the data center to the edge of the network, to have a totally harmonized network that can quickly move all the data.\nThen at the edge of the network, we will have different types of access technologies in order to serve our customers. Fixed wireless access can serve many different use cases. We tend to talk a lot about the consumer fixed wireless access use case, but I have, or Kyle, a lot of use cases in the business segment. If you look at the numbers this quarter, he's continuing to add a lot of fixed wireless access customers as well.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nThen Frank, on the capitalized interest question, in the quarter, we saw about $0.03 of pressure from capitalized interest in the time we got the licenses. Then for the Q4, we estimate $0.03 to 0.04 of pressure from capitalized interest. So I hope that helps.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nManaging Director of Telecommunications Services, Raymond James\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. Just the first one, Hans, at the very beginning of the call, you said that you were being really successful at three things: mobility, broadband, and private networks. And we haven't really heard a lot about what you're doing in private networks, what your goals are, what your successes have been. So if you could elaborate a little bit on what that is and why it's one of the big three things that we should care about Verizon being good at, it would be super helpful. And then the second is, and maybe this is more Tony. I think we just touched on it a little bit, but the success that you guys have been having in the postpaid phone subscriber net adds in business, could you elaborate a little bit on where that's coming from?\nGiven that the consumer isn't growing, how is it that the business continues to be so successful quarter after quarter after quarter? And should we assume that that just can continue? Thank you so much.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, David. On the private networks, yeah, good question. What is happening in the private network right now is that we are doing proof of concept to go to commercials. We have ramped up a fantastic funnel. We're starting getting more and more deals every quarter. They start pretty small. They start sort of like a Wi-Fi substitution. And then when it works, let's say you have one big logistics company, they take it to one logistics center, and then they do it in all. We are in that phase of ramping that up to do one to many at the moment. What we have done. We have done two things very important. We have cut the lead times on proof of concept to actually to commercial deal.\nIt's very clear for our customers that the capacity, the security, and the low latency is a game changer for them when they see it. And secondly, we also now have an ecosystem of products, infrastructure, modem, chipset, phones, and radios that can serve different use cases. So that's why we're excited over it. We're not going to see any significant revenues that have an impact on Verizon overall in 2024. We're going to see that in 2025. But why it's important is that this is an area we've never been into. This is a totally new terrain we can address by running private networks for different industries, for different large enterprises across the country with our distribution and technology. I see this as a great opportunity how we use our spectrum.\nSo that's why we pay a lot of attention to it, and with a lot of opportunities coming to it. Before Tony talks about the business segment and the wireless, I would say one main reason why we continue to do so well is our network is the best. I mean, if you ask any of our enterprise customers or SMB customers, the reliability and the performance of our network is just the best. And that's a very important buying criteria in that segment. Tony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nSure. So, Dave, a couple of things. We're pleased, again, with the strong results from Kyle and the team. We saw great phone net adds in the quarter, 151,000 and over 430,000 year to date. We saw healthy demand across the board. That would be enterprise, public sector, and small, medium biz. That performance is in a very uncertain environment. As Hans said, strong results validate that businesses continue to trust the Verizon network even during uncertain economic times. We do see certain pressures in certain sectors, and we're certainly not immune to it, but we're not seeing anything significant. From a competitive standpoint, I would tell you that we're being very disciplined, and we're not going to chase bad deals that are unprofitable. The other thing I would mention is FWA volumes also continue at a strong pace in business.\nWe had 132,000 net adds in the Q3 and over 400,000 year to date. We have great momentum heading into the Q4 here and as we set up for next year.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAnd if I could, just one more, and I apologize. Thank you, Tony. So Hans, it's been six months since the team kind of got reset and you put all the people to work. The results seem to be moving in the right direction. How happy are you with the choices you made right now?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nI'm very happy with the choices. I think, as always, when you make a change, and we did quite a big change. I mean, I think six out of the eight seats in the leadership team changed in one swoop. I think we had good alignment from the first week what we needed to do all the way from Kyle, Tony, and Sampath, which was very important, and Joe, which is sort of the four operational units. And you can see the results right now. I mean, the guys are executing extremely well. So though I'm happy with it, I'm going to push them even harder, but these guys are really good. They take hard pressure and they deliver on it. So no, I'm happy on the choices and the team is doing well.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYep. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. Maybe starting with Tony. Tony, can you talk about what contribution you're getting from your wholesale wireless revenues as the cable industry scales? And then could you just talk about what benefits that's having in terms of margin accretion and what have you? And then I wonder if you just how we should think about potential risk to that revenue stream as Comcast and Charter start to roll out strand-mounted small cells to potentially offload more of that traffic onto their own networks.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon Communications\n\nOkay. So a few things here. So as you know, we can't discuss the particular economics of any commercial deal. And that includes the commercial deals we have with the cable companies. What I can tell you is that we are very happy with the MVNO agreements, and those agreements are accretive. It's important business for us. And as Hans said many times, it's consistent with our strategy to monetize the network. It's very profitable business for us. It's growing, and we're very comfortable with the arrangement. But that's as far as we'll go.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nAll right. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director of US Media, Cable and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays",
    "content2": "Thank you. So maybe, Hans, for you, in terms of the fixed wireless business, when you think about the capacity that you have with C-Band, and you've talked a couple of times about momentum heading into next year as you expand into other footprints, is there any kind of a goalpost that you have in terms of the kind of growth aspirations that you have to balance it with the capacity use that the network may have? So the 350, 400 kind of a number, does it go to 500? Or is there some kind of a framework you guys are thinking about in terms of your aspiration there? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nThank you, Kannan. I think on the fixed wireless access, we have said a couple of times, we like the rhythm on 400,000 per quarter because it's putting our sort of our operations in the right mode of deploying this. As we have also decentralized or regionalized our go-to-market, we can work with the markets where we actually open for sale, fixed wireless access, work with the local community, work with the local government, and also address it through our stores. We can focus our efforts in that region and see that we capture all the demand and the funnel we have there. So we think it's a good model that we have right now. There's also some laws of physics, how quickly we can roll out the C-Band.\nBut I can tell you, there's no one holding back any investments here in order to get the C-Band to our customers as soon as possible. So I think we will continue to look at that and that type of levels going forward as well. And that will help us with reaching any goalpost we have or whatever goalpost we have communicated to the market.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director of US Media, Cable and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYep. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Greg Williams of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, Hans, you mentioned the improving KPIs when you launch C-Band in the markets, similar to last quarter as well. Just thinking, should we see churn improvements from here as the C-Band sort of maturates in these markets or have we reached sort of optimal levels? And then second one, just on media reports suggesting that you're hiring feverishly on the wireline side. And I'm just thinking about your fiber-to-the-home builds. Maybe it's not on the M&A side because of this high hurdle, but on the organic side, if you would bring up your builds or even the BEAD opportunity there. Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nOkay. On the KPIs, you're correct. We roll out the C-Band. We have better retention and better step-ups. And of course, we also expect that we can take share. I think in the consumer side and the business side, in both sides, we see opportunities as we come with the fixed wireless access to this market and with the C-Band. So there are share gains we are planning to do here, and our teams are very focused on it going forward. The second question was around fiber in our footprint, I guess. We're not holding back on that. I mean, first of all, you saw how great we're doing this quarter with Fios. We will continue to invest in Fios to see where our customers are.\nOutside the Fios, our primary strategy is to build on our One Fiber and do fixed wireless access to capture the market before anybody else is even remotely there. That's what we do. Then over time, as I've said a hundred times, I'm going to have optionality if I would have another access technology over time. But that's not in the cards right now. We have all the capacity and the technology out in the fields right now. And the quicker we can come out, the quicker we can meet the demand that's out there and meeting the customer that wants our broadband, which is a lot of them.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYep. Hey, Brad, we have time for one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, guys. Hans, just stepping back a second. Can you talk about the ability for yourselves and the industry to monetize all the investments the last few years, both to accelerate growth and free cash flow? How important is pricing here? Because inflation's running 4%, GDP's growing above 5%, inflation's probably above 4% again next year, and we're not really seeing much revenue growth. So what do you think needs to be done for the industry to kind of monetize all the investments? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nI can talk for ourselves. I think we are in a moment where we actually are monetizing by being very segmented, both in our business side and in our consumer side, and that we both having the right offers for our customers. At the same time, we are generating bottom line for ourselves. So I think that's where we are. We have done some price adjustment, but that has also included new values for our customers. I think we now are coming to a moment where we're probably going to have a little bit more of quantities, not only price, given the trajectory we have in our business right now. So we're going to balance that out, doing the right for our customers, but also doing right for our shareholders. Then we're, of course, adding that with our broadband growth, which is also helping us.\nAnd then, as Tony said, we're taking out cost at the same time. So that's how we work. And that's why we can lift the Free Cash Flow for this year, the guidance, even though we're on the high end on our CapEx guidance, as well as higher or headwinds from the interest rate. So that tells you a little bit how we feel about our business, how we now have the right propositions in the market, and we can sort of retooling that if something happens. But right now, we feel confident about the model we have.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nRelated to that, I know you want to get that depth back to pre-auction levels. Do you have kind of a timeframe on that? And just remind us what how do you do that?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah. So what we have said before was that we want to come to a ratio of 2.25x net debt to EBITDA. And we're going to continue to work our way down. And that is a primary goal for us. Number one, in the capital allocation, is to invest in our business. Number two is continue to put our board in a position so they can increase our dividend. We are on 17 years of consecutive increases. And thirdly, we're paying down our debt. When we come to that ratio, we will start having a conversation about buybacks. But we want to do buybacks, not as a one-off or something. It has to be a consecutive program over time. But we're not there yet. But the team is doing a great job.\nTony talked about the $2.6 billion that we reduced the debt this quarter with the tenders we have done. So we will continue to do that with the cash flow that we're yielding right now.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Verizon Communications\n\nYeah. Thanks, Tim. Brad, before we end the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing statements here.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon Communications\n\nBefore we close, I want to take a moment to address the humanitarian crisis in Israel and Palestine that has continued to escalate over the past few weeks. At Verizon, we stand against terrorism in all its forms and condemn the violence that has claimed the lives of so many innocent civilians. The Verizon Foundation has committed a $2 million donation to organizations supporting relief efforts, and we continue to waive international long-distance charges for calls and texts from the US to the region. My hope is that we will move to a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. In the meantime, we need to come together as a society and lean into what connects us, not what divides us.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."

To ask a question, press star one on your touchtone phone. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star two. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Verizon\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement, which can be found on slide two of the presentation.\nInformation in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning we posted to our investor relations website a detailed review of our Q2 results. You will find additional detail in the earnings materials on our investor relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 Earnings Call. Me and my team are pleased to report another solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue, and expansion on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business, and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year over year, and Adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow was $5.6 billion. The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations, and ensure a solid balance sheet are working.\nOur results today illustrate our ability to adapt, innovate, and excel even in times of economic uncertainty. We're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband, and cloud in the 5G era in all customer segments. Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to the hard work and the dedication of our team. Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks, and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade levels, and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process and we're always looking for ways to do better.\nIn May we myPlan, a first of its kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control, and simplicity they want. This aligns with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early myPlan has already helped our Verizon Consumer Group deliver notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come for our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we're constantly evolving our offerings to fit customers' needs. We will also continue to invest in prepaid to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year.\nAs we reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high value they place on our services. Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team support a stronger Verizon where we are the premium provider. With elements like the myPlan, strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation, and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction, we are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth. Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular decline in wireline continues.\nFor the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon Business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world class network on private networks. We won a mandate from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next generation private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development. The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share.\nOur broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on FiOS and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable broadband performance. This represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our growth trajectory. We have established a high pace of customer growth. It's clear fixed wireless access is here to stay. As a proven competitive broadband product, we're well on track to meet our target of four to five million fixed wireless access subscribers by the end of 2025 from a current base of nearly 2.3 million subscribers. We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price and speed tiers so that our customers can choose the service that best suits them.\nFurther, we continue to see Net Promoter scores of FiOS and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings. We have the best network in the market, and in next couple of quarters we will extend our lead with a last chance on the C-Band spectrum. For the 31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power's US Wireless Network Quality Study. No other wireless provider has achieved this, and for 2023 we received top scores among all J.D. Power study factors in all six regions. Additionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country and successfully testing our ability to slice our 5G network.\nslicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of the largest base of wireless customers in the United States. Next, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take this matter seriously, and to be very clear, lead infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing out from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At Verizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do, and we're using a fact- and science-based approach in our assessment. You will hear more on the topic from Tony later on.\nOur accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure which we put in place over the last couple of quarters, are already paying off. Verizon Global Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation, leveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains. We're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 to 3 billion in annual savings by 2025. These savings, in combination with the completion of the $10 billion C-Band spend, position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we execute on our capital allocation strategy. Now I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThanks Hans and good morning. Our results for the Q2 demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, and increasing Free Cash Flow. Our focus on execution is working and we remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance while remaining financially disciplined. In the Q2, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results both sequentially and year-over-year in postpaid phone net adds. Additionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth. The results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-Band deployment and improved go-to-market execution.\nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the Q2 of 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again, up 6.9% year over year driven by new to Verizon gross adds which increased approximately 19% over the prior year period. We also saw notable growth in consumer postpaid ARPA which was up 6.2% year over year. The recent launch myPlan reflects a more segmented and targeted approach. While it's still myPlan is driving a significantly higher premium mix with nearly 70% myPlan customers taking the Unlimited Plus option. We are also encouraged by the step activity we are seeing. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up 1 basis point compared with the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year over year increase offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn.\nOur involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter. It is important to note our performance in existing C-Band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-Band, postpaid phone gross adds growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non C-Band markets. Additionally, phone churn was 4 basis points lower in C-Band markets, and our premium mix in C-Band markets was 11 percentage points higher. Let's now look at our business results. Verizon Business once again delivers solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading wireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all three customer groups, resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the Q2 compared to 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals.\nAs Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds. We continue to win high value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent government contract win where we took share from two of our competitors at attractive ARPUs. Moving on to broadband, we maintain our strong performance with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the Q2. In the past four quarters we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21%. During that time, growth in FWA remained healthy with 384,000 net adds up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers on our FWA product and we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the Q3.\nOn the FiOS side, Internet net adds for the Q2 were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the Q2 of last year. Despite continued softness in household move activity, gross adds rose year over year, and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to take steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year. Prepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the Q2. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent a low point as we continue to make progress integrating TracFone while taking actions to better position us for growth, including scaling our Visible and Total by Verizon brands. As Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the Q3. Let's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year over year.\nThe decline can be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue, which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year. As postpaid phone upgrade activity declined 34% versus the same period last year, service and other revenue grew 0.8% driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8% year over year and more than $200 million sequentially in the Q2. We continued to benefit from pricing actions, including a recent change to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue and growth in fixed wireless access drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued pressure from the amortization of handset promotions. We are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year.\nWe continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions to better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our FWA bundle pricing for new customers, which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization of promotional costs in the second half of the year, and given the softer upgrade environment and our disciplined approach to promotional spending. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes and improved service revenue.\nThese benefits were partially offset by higher marketing expenses in the quarter related to myPlan launch as well as a $194 million increase in bad debt year over year. Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter, and payment trends remain consistent with recent quarters and pre-pandemic levels. Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, and special items were down 5.9% year over year primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives within our Verizon Global Services organization. During the quarter we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products.\nWe are on track to deliver $200 to 300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts and continue to make progress towards achieving our goal of $2 to 3 billion dollars of annual cost savings by 2025. Cash flow from operating activities for the Q2 was $9.7 billion dollars and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion dollars compared to $17.7 billion dollars in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and fewer upgrades, which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. Capex for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-band program. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year.\nWe continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 to 19.25 billion. Our peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business as usual run rate for CapEx, which we expect will continue into 2024. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cash flow for the first half of the year is $8 billion, a nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination of our lower CapEx spend compared to the prior year and operating cash flow benefits previously mentioned. While we do not normally guide on free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the full year.\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous quarter and $4.1 billion lower year over year. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities with no remaining obligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the Q2, a 0.1x improvement both sequentially and year over year. We continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely, given recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases later in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to 0.30 and there's no change to that view.\nOur strong Q2 results support our capital allocation priorities which remain unchanged. Before I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on Lead Sheath Cables in our network.\nHere is what we currently know: we still have some legacy lead sheath cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry, records are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable in our network has lead sheathing. However, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000mi of cable, roughly half of which is aerial, and lead sheath cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network. This number excludes the network elements previously owned by MCI and XO Communications because we are still reviewing the historical records of those companies. When not disturbed, the likelihood of exposure to lead from lead sheath cables is low.\nIn addition, because the lead sheath cable was used as a feeder and distribution cable and does not run into individual homes or apartments, it is generally in locations that minimize the potential for public contact. We are working with a third party expert to conduct our own testing at our sites that were identified by the media. We will not have the results of our testing for several weeks. When we have the results of our testing, we will work closely with our industry and others to address any concerns and issues.\nNow, I think it's important to address a question we've received from a lot of investors which is about the process for and potential cost of removal of the Lead Sheath Cable in our network. Given where we are in this process, it is far too soon to make any projection on what the potential financial impact might be to the company. There are a number of unknowns in this area, including whether there is a health risk presented by undisturbed Lead Sheath Cable and if there is a risk, how that risk should be addressed. As a result, we do not believe there is a meaningful way to estimate any potential cost to the company or that any such estimate would even be useful.\nWe won't be able to provide any additional color during the Q&A session, as we have more information we can share on the topic. We will certainly do that. I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Tony. As we pass the midpoint of 2023, I'm pleased by how we are effectively delivering on our priorities, and I'm confident that we will meet the financial goals we set for ourselves for the full year. To summarize in mobility, our segmented and disciplined approach to the market is working, and our efforts to improve the Consumer Group's performance will continue throughout the second.\nHalf of the year.\nIn broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we capitalize on the unique strength and capabilities of both technologies. We continue to have the best network in the market, and our leadership position will only get stronger as we continue to roll out C-Band. While we're encouraged by the quarter's result, there's more work to be done. My leadership team and I are laser focused on delivering what we committed to you at top of the year. Strong wireless service, revenue, EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, as well as meeting our 2023 financial guidance. By that, I hand it over to Brady for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Hans. Brady, we'll take the first question. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly. When prompted, your name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your request, please press star two. One moment for our first question.\nOur first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nLooks like a nice beat on the.\nConsumer side, really driven by the postpaid ARPA growth of about 6%. Could you guys sort of pull that apart a little bit and maybe talk about the sustainability of that and the service revenue growth you saw as we.\nHead into the second half?\nI mean, I think you lapsed some price increases, but you've got some other price increases coming through, and some of the promotional stuff rolling off, and then maybe just quickly on the lead. Obviously, you guys can't quantify, but when you guys say low single low exposure of the 540,000 miles of copper is.\nThat single digit, can you guys tighten?\nUp that number for us a little bit? That'd be great.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue, as you see in this quarter. We are expanding the growth from the Q1, but as many components. I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA expansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth. And then, of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well. I mean, eight quarters more than 125,000. So we are actually doing a lot of things in different areas. But then, if you go to the consumer group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be segmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers. myPlan has been playing in very well to that.\nAs you heard Tony talking about 70% are taking the premium plan. But that's just the start of it. We're not done, but clearly, I'm confident that a team knows how to manage this, given how much we invested in research on the consumer side to understand our consumers better. That's why we myPlan. so all in all, I have to say the guys are doing well. I'm confident we will continue on this stride, but maybe Tony can give you some more on that and then we can come back to the lead.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYes.\nThanks, Hans.\nGood morning, John. So, on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide you mentioned, tough comps that we face in the second half. When you think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you. As you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the legacy unlimited plans that we did earlier in the quarter as well as most recently changes to our handset insurance program, and price changes on FWA bundles. Secondly, we had the introduction myPlan back in May that's helped with premium mix, and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the Unlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increasing contribution from Fixed Wireless Access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and we have great momentum on FWA.\nThen fourth, you know, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. Then lastly, when you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters, and that's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So when you put that all together, we're very confident that all the initiatives here will continue to drive meaningful revenue growth in the second half.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously and we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and fact based as Tony said. We're going over.\nThe different places that we pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal and external experts, and that's where we are. We will do this very thoroughly. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based, scientific, and that's how we're going to do, and that's what you should expect from us.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. And John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network. So that work is still ongoing as well. So we still have more work to do, work to do there, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, John. Brady, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Taking the question, and I think I'll follow up on consumer volumes you alluded to in responding to John. It was great to see the consumer phone losses improve year over year, but I know your ambition is to do better than that. How do you think about the path getting back to net growth in consumer postpaid phones?\nDo you think you're going to need to take further actions in terms of the product mix or pricing, or even any additional internal adjustments, or do you think you have the pieces in place and it's really just a matter of driving better execution against that framework? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nI think it's about execution on the framework. We have built right now the guys have everything. Sampath and the team together with Tony and me the full support we have a new platform myPlan. we're segmented up the market. We work with financial discipline. The target we have for our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as Sampath the team said before, we ultimately we want our fair share also on the net adds, but ultimately we measure ourselves on service revenue growth, and as you can see we continue to improve that. So it's more about now executing on this, being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving.\nAnd some of the numbers that Tony talked about, you see the impact we have when the C-Band is coming out, and then myPlan you see also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the right place. So all that is in place, and then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution and doing it with the financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHow do we think about a timeline for getting to sustainably positive net adds in consumer? Is that something that would be a reasonable expectation once you have C-Band fully deployed?\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYes, it's Tony. Volumes are important to the business, and as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call Q3 positive for consumer, but as we said, we expect improvements year over year in consumer net adds, and the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on on that.\nThank you. Yes, Brady, we're ready for the next question. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the second phase of C-band. It was helpful to get those statistics. Could you just help us a little bit more in terms of what this is going to mean in terms of your footprint both on the wireless side and on the fixed wireless side? How do we think that's going to help both coverage and also capacity? I know there's concerns in some quarters about fixed wireless facing congestion. It'd be great to let us know what your experience has been with usage and how you feel good about handling that, 4 to 5 million and beyond over the next few years, and then maybe a quick one for Tony.\nObviously the stock's been under some pressure here, pretty high yield perhaps. Remind us about how you're thinking about potentially going to buybacks? You're seeing some deleveraging now. Strong free cash flow. Is that going to be an option here in the not too distant future? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-Band, I said we're ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team is ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course more coverage as well. So it's given us both, and as you have seen the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-Band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers and of course we open up Fixed Wireless Access. So that should be positive over time for us. When it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean, the guys are doing an enormously good job as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity network planning.\nJoe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the right for our customers. Remember, we are building a multi-purpose network. That means that we have one radio that serves multiple opportunities: wireless, fixed wireless access, and in some cases private networks. So all that is in one. And that's the efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we expected when we started with 5G and the C-Band to see that we get a leverage model over time. But of course it's going to roll out over the next year. So I'm confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThe C-Band spectrum. Okay, Simon, and then on your question on the cash generation, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that it is running higher than normal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-Band clearing obligations remaining in due soon, and that's obviously a priority for us. The cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality, and supports a much improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We said first we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to delever, and you'll see us be focused on that.\nAnd then, once we get to the.\nLeverage metric of 2.25. We will consider buybacks. At that time.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, guys. Thanks. With the price increases and the impact of the new pricing structure, it looks like you're trending above the midpoint of service revenue growth. I mean, could be closer to the high end. Any reason to think it decelerates from here, and then second, Hans, you spoke on private wireless. Can you dig into the market opportunity there and how long it takes for that to be a billion-dollar business? Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nI start with a second question and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless. What we have found out during the work we've been doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on it, the speed, and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on licensed spectrum and then you start adding on to it. Usually start with one factory and if you see that you're working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming in in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again is building on the same investment, the same Verizon intelligence network.\nI don't think we should expect that it's a billion-dollar business this year, but definitely over time this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth in the service revenue and actually doing even better with enterprises. So it's going to take some time, but I'm really pleased what I've seen the last couple of quarters how this is turning out. And I would say we have now an ecosystem with devices, with radio-based stations, with integrators, and all of that, which we haven't had before. So I'm more optimistic than a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field, and that's why I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. Good morning, Phil. And then on the, on the service revenue, as we mentioned up front, we have some tough comps as we lap the price ups from last year. We do expect sequential improvements in the Q3. One thing to note just on the, on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125 million. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the Q3 before it eases up in the Q4. That's probably one additional data point for you.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, Tony. Excellent.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYep.\nThanks, Phil. Brady, we're ready for the next question. The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open, sir.\n\nFrank Louthan\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you. Can you walk us through the correlation between the broadband adds and the business wireless adds, including both the FiOS and fixed wireless? And then you mentioned expecting some softer upgrades. Are you anticipating having to subsidize any more for handsets to get adds as the year goes on? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the broadband side, I think I got the question like that. The correlation between the fixed wireless access and the FiOS, I mean, let me say that on the fixed wireless access, right now we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the ILEC, because that's just how it is because the FiOS is so strong. So we're doing great on the FiOS business. And as you have seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before, we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on FiOS. So FiOS is doing really well. And then of course, we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something, but it's growing. The good thing for us is we have own economics on everything fixed broadband, wireless, FiOS.\nWe have one network, we have our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want convergence or not, and that nobody else has in the industry. So, really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as one of the most important 5G innovations we've done. We add substantial new customers there. So now this is a great opportunity. And, as you saw, right now we continue doing as we have done. We are now 2.3 billion customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different pricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers because they can choose between different models depending what needs they have.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah. The only other thing I would add is that, you know, we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter, and again another, the third consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds. We continue to see good momentum with customers taking, you know, wireless customers taking FWA. We see great progress there as well.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThen you had a question of upgrades, and as you have seen, promos that is clearly down in Q2 and Q1 as well. There are many reasons for it, some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also haven't been any major new devices coming out. It will probably come one in H2. It usually comes. So we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels we have seen before. From a point of view of Verizon, we think that we're going to be disciplined. We're going to offer.\nDevices, promos, and upgrades where there's the best for the segment and for the customer. But it will not come back to the levels that we saw before.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nAll right, great. Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Frank. Brady, we're ready for the next question. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys, thanks for taking the questions.\nI wanted to come back to the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. Before the lead, this was the big issue.\nIf there were two pillars to the idea behind the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry, one was that somehow Verizon had negotiated a deal with the cable industry that they would guarantee to make money no matter how much data cable consumers took. And the second was that that deal would never end. It was going to be forever.\nAnd so I feel like the messaging on that has started to change from Verizon a little bit and that maybe that the idea that cable industry is guaranteed to make money in the relationship between Verizon and cable regardless of data consumption, that that's not true and that this deal isn't permanent, that it could change at some future time, even though the DOJ, obviously you need to have some deal, but it doesn't have to be this deal. And I was wondering if you could kind of just address that for us right now.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you, David. Thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have NDAs when it comes to our contract. The only thing that I'm ensuring is that Verizon making money on this. That I can tell you. And we think this is an important business. These are important customers to us. And again, I go back to what I talked about before we build the network. Once the more connections, the more usage, and the more revenue we have on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that happening, we will continue the work we're doing. However, I cannot go into specifics on the contracts because first of all, I'm not allowed to do it.\nBut clearly you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that with the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders, and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks Dave. Brady. We're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks and good morning. Two questions if I could. First, just following up on the comments around tiering of fixed wireless and potentially on speed, is there also an opportunity to begin tiering mobile 5G wireless in terms of megabits per second rather than a historical way of tiering on gigabytes per month of consumption? And then just secondly, you mentioned that the cash Capex is tracking to guidance. But just curious, as you're deploying the mid-band spectrum, the depth of it and seeing what the propagation is, are there opportunities to get further efficiencies in capital and potentially go below the business as usual indication of Capex for 2024?\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nHey Mike, thank you for the question. On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for a 5G, I think we're finding a good model myPlan right now with different type of network options. Then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should see the first.\nSort of launch here as the first time we come out with a platform. We see multiple opportunities, how you can.\nSort of diversify that one in different ways to meet different customer demands. So you will probably see more of that going forward, how we'll do that. So clearly very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and things like that. But now we have a great base. That myPlan. on the capex side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long hammer coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, investing in fiber, investing.\nIn all the parts of Millimeter Wave, then coming into the hump of C-Band. Now we come into the BAU. As far as we can see right now, BAU is around 17 to 17.5, and that's going to see that we can deploy the C-Band getting all the benefits we talked about. 4G is coming down. Fiber is more success based, so there's a lot of things happening in there. But we're really confident that we can be on those levels, and our team is really doing a great job.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nGreat. Thanks Mike. Yeah Brad, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Two questions, if I could. First, if I could return to the lead topic for one moment. Can you just talk about the extent to which you used overlashing of fiber to what might potentially be lead cables, particularly in your aerial plant in the northeast? And then second, I just wonder if you could just help us think about the trajectory going forward of fixed wireless, which has seemingly sort of steadied out to a relatively stable number. Is that what we should expect? Because that would take us a bit higher than your guidance by the end of 2025. So I'm just wondering how we think about the pacing of fixed wireless.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nThank you. Craig, start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one. We will hear from Tony on that one. On the fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we are now running on a fairly high level, adding broadband subscriber quarter. Remember, we have a defined, we are roughly in, I would say a little bit over 70 of the PAs of C-Band so far out of 402. So that of course is how many OFs are open for sales we can do right now. So that is a little bit the next step going to be the next tranche coming in. And I said we're well ahead to the 4 to 5 million. The team is doing a great job.\nYou also saw that we now are doing some great work on how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that.\nSo.\nSo all in all, I think that fixed wireless assets and how we manage our network is going great. And of course, as an ambitious leader as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now that's the forecast. We have 4 to 5 million and we are really doing well. And the customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so simple. You install it yourself, you get broadband immediately. So we are just meeting a consumer demand that no one else is doing, basically. So I'm really pleased with the product. We talked about this being one of the most important 5G applications and now you can see what it means to us and how important it's going to be over time.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThen Craig, on the lead, as we said earlier, it's a small part of our network. It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical records, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical approach, very fact-based, very science-based approach. And as we know, everyone wants more information, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.\nYeah, thanks Craig. Brady, we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brian Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nBrian Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. I want to ask two if I could. I guess first just on the lead issue, I was wondering if you thought this might lead to an acceleration in copper network retirements and therefore an accelerated reduction in fixed costs for legacy networks. It seems like an opportunity in cases where communities might want to not have lead cable in their communities even if it isn't actually shedding any lead. And then secondly, I just had a follow up to Simon's question earlier. Can you talk about how the remaining C-Band deployments will affect the fixed wireless opportunity in rural areas?\nSpecifically, how much of an expansion in the rural footprint will that represent versus the available footprint today for fixed wireless, and would that include a lot of areas that aren't served by anything today except for copper infrastructure? So you know, kind of the true rural areas. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nSo on the first one.\nWe have.\nhave a plan for network transformation that we continue ongoing that has not changed when it comes to this lead sheath cables discussion. I said, I mean, we're going to go through this systematic, we're going to do tests, we're going to do it fact-based, and then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to keep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline. So he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time. On the second question on fixed wireless access. Yeah, of course, when we do the first 70, I would say, ish, C-band market PEAs as it's called.\nThey are mainly in urban areas, and that's where we have had that good traction on Fixed Wireless Access. The next step is going to be much more suburban and rural, and of course that's great opportunities because usually there are even less different options for customers in those areas. So of course that's going to create opportunity for us. That doesn't mean that we are changing our guidance. We still say 4 to 5 million by 2025. Of course the team is always driving hard here and I'm driving hard. We always want to achieve; we want to show our stakeholders that we're a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So definitely we see opportunities. We're coming with the next tranche of C-Band.\n\nBrian Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thank you very much, Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thanks Brian. Brad, Ray for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\n\nTim Horan\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, Ted. On the wholesale, on the cable side, maybe just discuss the wholesale wireless ARPUs. Broadly speaking, do you think you can grow wholesale wireless ARPUs and then the $10 increase in fixed wireless pricing, do you think that would slow kind of sub growth quarterly? We've seen obviously good strength there. And then lastly on the lead side, can you just qualitatively talk how often are your workers exposed to lead? I'm sure you have to log that. And what do you do to kind of protect workers? And have you ever seen any claims from workers on lead poisoning? Thanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon",
    "content2": "There were many questions in all. So let me start by.\nThe change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access. Again, we have a premium product, we have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose where the best tier is or what the best service is. So, we think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. And I think you just think about when we started with unlimited. You start with one plan and then you start to work with different segmentation because ultimately we are in a very, very big consumer business where so many differentiated customers that need different type of services. So just think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way.\nThen I hand it over to Tony.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nFor the next question. Yeah, on the cable partnership, as had mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see, you know, volume growth.\nIn the relationship, and we're very satisfied with the relationship, and we continue to monetize the network as Hans said earlier.\nAnd then on wireless exposure.\nYou know, we continue to work through, you know, across the company and continue to take a methodical approach. We're not going to get into specifics around employees or anything, but you know, as we said, we'll keep you posted as we learn more. Yeah,\nthanks Tim. Brady, ready for the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Sir, you may go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thank you. I wanted to ask two questions, one on upgrade rates and the other on FWA. On upgrade rates, I wondered if you could discuss why they've fallen so much and whether it's sustainable, what the risks are to recent trend. And on FWA, just wonder if you could discuss the service price increase that we learned about this week. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nOn the upgrade rates, as I said before. I mean, first of all, we at Verizon have been very disciplined in how.\nTo.\nOffer sort of products and services with the right price at the right time. So definitely that has been that. We are actually doing less promos and less upgrades. That has not hampered our way of growing our business or taking customers. And we will continue to work with that. Then, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect there's going to be a product coming out in the second half. We're excited over that. And, of course, that's going to drive upgrades.\nPromos, of course. But again, we will continue to be very financial disciplined. But of course we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic and when store traffic comes, we are really good and having good conversion rate, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important. And second, on the fixed wireless access.\nTaking away the discount, again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless access customers. There are so many different types of customers and consumers we have. So of course having different tiers and pricings becomes very normal in order to meet customer demands. So it's just how we do and that we'll continue to do and see how the market is developing.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nOkay. Hey, Brady, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe final question for today will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed\n\nThanks, Hans.\nI just want to actually do a follow up to that upgrade question.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nWe can hear you, Walt.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nWe can hear you, Walt. Go.\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed\n\nYou can hear me? Yeah. Okay. I don't know why he was telling me to check.\n\nTony Skiadas\n\nCFO, Verizon\n\nThe last. Maybe he was trying to mute me. The last of the last two years. Hans' upgrade rate has actually declined in the Q3. So I just want to kind of piecemeal together like you said, you're not going to do handset promotions. Earlier in the call, obviously everyone knows Apple comes out with a new product, but.\nIn the last answer, it sounds like you thought people would upgrade more. What seasonal trend should we see here? I assume you're still expecting it to be down year-on-year, but what about sequentially? Because it's been typically down sequentially in the Q3 for the last two quarters. Maybe COVID had some impact on that. I don't know. Then my second question on CapEx, there's some debate. I think a lot of the tower companies specifically are trying to drive this narrative of like, oh, you know, your C-band is going to get deployed but they're doing fixed wireless and all these things. You're going to have to come back and do densification very quickly. So any lull in CapEx will be short-lived. I'm just curious, I mean obviously we saw the CapEx drop very quickly here in this quarter.\nHow long do you think this kind of Capex holiday will exist before you need to come back and use densification in the absence of additional spectrum sourced by the FCC?\n\nWalter Piecyk\n\nAnalyst, LightShed\n\nThanks.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman and CEO, Verizon\n\nYeah, thank you, thank you. On the upgrade.\nAs I cannot, I don't know anything about any launch or the product, how exciting it's going to be, but ultimately that usually drive more upgrades, so let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited, excited to see Apple coming out with a new phone. You know, hopefully they're coming in this half. You know I cannot reveal what they are doing, but clearly we're excited for that on the Capex. Yeah, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good sustainable level of this. Densification is part of our strategy already. So and many of the things that were already different deploying on C-Band we deploy sort of for the full spectrum already from the beginning. Then we turn on when we get those transients.\nThere's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible, capex. That's why I feel really good.\nOn our sort of DAU around 17 to 17.5.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; as well as our current Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis, and Chief Financial Officer designate, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation.\nInformation in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nEarlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our first quarter results. Please note that during the first quarter, in order to better serve our customers, we reorganized the customer groups within our business segment. We now report the following customer groups: enterprise and public sector, business markets and Software as a Service and wholesale. Prior period operating revenue results within the business segment have been recast to reflect these changes. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call 2023. We delivered a solid first quarter marked by strong performance as we continue to execute on our plan to grow the business across mobility, broadband and private networks. We're making steady progress and expect to keep up the momentum going forward. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew total postpaid phone gross adds by 5% year-over-year this quarter and achieved 3% wireless service revenue growth $11.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA as well as a strong cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior year.\nWe're working every day to move the business forward by using the power of America's most reliable network to deliver the best experience for our customers. During the quarter, we reached more than 200 million POPs covered C-band in just over a year since we lead up the first site. With access to that spectrum and advancing the build-out as quickly as we did, we have enabled new source of revenue growth and elevated our customers' overall wireless experience.\nIn the first quarter, J.D. Power recognized us as the most awarded for network quality for the 30th time in a row. We're seeing improvements in already leading network performance validated by year-to-date root metrics testing and our customers are taking notice. Where we offer C-band, we see significant benefits in fixed wireless access consumer phone gross adds and retention as well as premium take rates. We also see 4G customers benefiting as we offload traffic in some markets to our 5G Ultra Wideband network. The performance improvements will continue as 5G penetration expands market by market.\nWe're excited about the remaining deployment of C-band spectrum and the potential dividend lack for both our business and consumer performance. Moving on to mobility. On the business side, even in the current economic conditions by peers across different industries have combined confidence that mobility remains a priority in their spending. During the first quarter, Verizon business continued to run of strong performance, delivering 136,000 postpaid phone net adds. This was accomplished in spite of some pressures around restructurings within the technology sector.\nOn the consumer side, payment trends are at healthy pre-COVID levels and consumers are shopping, evidenced by our increase in consumer postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 11% year-over-year, with the new to Verizon ads leading the way. Our gross ad performance is proof that are surgical and segmented approach to the market is working. We're in a much better position than a year ago, entering the second quarter with a sustained momentum around gross adds as well as postpaid churn where we saw improved performance each month across the first quarter.\nWe remain committed to our strategy, not to compete on who can discount the most, but rather who can offer the most value to customers the best overall experience and the best customer satisfaction. +play is a great example of this. We listen to our consumers and introduce exciting partners like Peloton and Netflix providing exclusive deals on an easy-to-use subscription managed platform, and there is more to come. Our segmented approach to the market recognize that one plan doesn't fit all, and we have continued the work to address are underperforming segments. I've talked about our efforts to be more targeted and surgical with our retention. And we saw that play out during the quarter.\nBy reducing upgrade volumes and lowering inefficient spending, we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a good place with churn and executing on migrations to premium unlimited. Those are real cash savings and a key driving to the large year-over-year improvements in free cash flow. You have seen us taking pricing action most recently on some of our legacy unlimited plans. We continue to look across our base and evaluate opportunities to more closely align pricing to our value proposition. On prepaid, we are working diligently to realize the full potential of this segment. While net adds were down by more than 207,000 versus the prior year, this total was affected by 2 transitory factors.\nFirst, more than 100% of our net year-over-year decline came from higher disconnects within our SafeLink brand, which provides services to customers on government subsidized programs. We're still in process of migrating customers onto our network as well. Prepaid is an important part of our value segment strategy and our investment here will continue as we're confident that will pay off in the long term.\nTurning to broadband, which is a major growth area for us across consumer and business. We achieved the highest net adds in over 10 years, adding 437,000 total net adds within the quarter, including 67,000 net adds from Fios. We are very pleased with the Fios performance with net adds up 12% year-over-year. For fixed wireless access, we're seeing growth quarter-after-quarter of the quarter with 1.9 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter, fixed wireless continues to scale and contribute increasingly to our revenue performance.\nOur business customers are increasingly turning to fixed wireless access as their primary source of broadband connectivity. Won over by the reliability and the overall value of the product. In addition, to take any share from our competitors, we're also seeing new use cases across all of our customer groups leveraging the flexibility of the product to expand beyond what traditional wired broadband can do.\nFinally, in private networks, our Verizon business team continues to execute at a high level. We announced new deals with KPMG and Deloitte and have a strong funnel of business ahead of us. We have also established a leadership position as a top network provider in the public sector. This quarter, we announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with FAA worth over $2 billion to design, build and operate and maintain the FAA's next-generation communication platform. This is in addition to many ongoing products we're working on for large federal agencies.\nIn creating the networks that move the world forward, we remain committed to running our business responsibly for our customers, shareholders, employees and society. Last month, we published our 2022 ESG report, which highlights how business ethics, governance, environmental stewardship and human rights are at the center of everything we do.\nI encourage you to take some time to review the report and learn about how we are managing risk and unlocking opportunities surrounding the issues of utmost importance for our stakeholders. Our commitments here come right from our leaders and their teams. A few weeks ago, I announced new leadership for our 2 business units, the network organization and our Chief Financial Officer. These leaders come with nearly 100 years of experiences within Verizon and bring a proven track record of successful execution.\nLet me take a moment to walk through these changes. Sampath takes over as a CEO of Verizon Consumer. His objectives are clear: to enhance our consumer operation model and experience, deepen our segmentation approach, scale, fixed wireless access and broadband and drive financial discipline. Kyle Malady was appointed CEO of Verizon business. CIOs are increasingly searching for technology reach solutions, and nobody knows our technology like Kyle.\nHis focus is clear: drive sustainable growth in mobility and deliver on the revenue growth opportunities within fixed wireless, 5G private wireless and mobile edge compute solutions. Joe Russo takes over as a President of Global Networks and Technology to continue our efforts to extend, enhance and solidify the nation's leading wireless network and vast global IP and fiber network. Finally, Matt Ellis leaves us at the end of the month, on the 10 years at Verizon and 6 years as our CFO. I want to thank him for his many contributions to our business.\nTony Skiadas assumed the title of Chief Financial Officer on May 1. I appreciate Tony's work to improve operations and drive performance as we search for a long-term CFO replacement. So let's now move on, in talking about efficiencies. The teams are on the way to deliver better, simpler and more efficient end-to-end processes for our customers and employees. Spearheaded by the Verizon Global Services Group, we're looking into numerous areas across the business that will help drive bottom line growth, including IT platform transformations, building advanced AI models for the better diagnostic and predictive insights, optimizing our real estate footprint and managing our supply chain efficiently.\nWe have also reduced headcount over the last quarters. All in all, our cost efficiency program is on track to achieve our target of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual savings by 2025, which will help to fund our growth as well as drive margin improvements over time. With almost all our $10 billion C-band capital expenditure program behind us, we expect our cash generation profile to expand over the next few years, driven by revenue growth cost management and efficiencies with capital expenditures. This helps support our objective to achieve consistent dividend growth with our 16 consecutive years of increases currently the longest streak in the industry.\nAs we look to build on the free cash flow growth generated in the first quarter, we expect to see significant improvement in our dividend payout ratio this year putting the board in a strong position to increase the dividend once again and bring us closer to our debt targets over the following years. Going into the second quarter, I'm energized by the execution of the Verizon team and our new leadership across key positions. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow expansion.\nAnd with that, I will now turn it over to Matt for the last time.\n\nMatthew D. Ellis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Verizon Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the first quarter reflect the steps we have taken to improve our performance. C-band and the investments in our network are having a positive benefit on customer and overall network experiences. And as Hans mentioned, we are seeing a direct benefit around fixed wireless and phone gross adds, among other metrics, where we operate C-band, but more work remains to be done. Taking a look at operating results of the first quarter, let's start with consumer postpaid phones, which had 263,000 net losses for the quarter compared to 292,000 net losses for the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds was strong across the quarter, up over 11% year-over-year, continuing the momentum from the second half of last year.\nOur efforts around the segmentation of our base and our more targeted go-to-market approach and offerings to those different customer groups have been key drivers behind our improved gross adds performance. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.84% and up 7 basis points compared to the same period last year. We are now seeing a return of involuntary churn rates to pre-pandemic levels. As for voluntary churn, performance was mixed across the quarter starting off elevated as we saw normal holiday season activity extend into the early parts of the first quarter.\nBut as the quarter progressed, we saw improvements in terms of year-over-year churn performance exit in the quarter with voluntary churn rates in line with last year. While we have more work to do to improve consumer net adds, we are encouraged by the double-digit percentage improvement in gross adds combined with the improved churn level at the end of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with significantly better momentum than a year ago.\nMoving on to the business segment. Verizon business again delivered strong results. We saw solid demand across our 3 customer groups and had 136,000 phone net adds for the first quarter compared to 256,000 for the same period last year. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a couple of large deals that contributed to our net adds results a year ago. Additionally, we saw an increase in churn due to business customers being more cautious around spending and the restructurings Hans noted in his remarks.\nMoving along to broadband on a consolidated basis, we delivered 437,000 net additions in the first quarter, the most in a decade. As expected, we saw another quarter of sequential growth in fixed wireless with 393,000 net ads, up from 379,000 in the prior quarter. Customer satisfaction remains high as evidenced by NPS scores as well as encouraging churn trends around the more tenured cohorts of customers. On the Fios side, Internet net adds for the first quarter was 67,000 and up from 60,000 in the first quarter of last year.\nCustomers continue to be attracted to our high-quality broadband products, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in Fios gross adds even in an environment with lower move volumes versus the prior year.\nFios retention rates continue to be strong with our best churn performance in more than 5 years. While the first quarter results were prepaid were below our expectations, we remain confident in the value market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans to satisfy the needs of all of our customers.\nYou heard from Hans some of the actions we are taking to create long-term value. As expected, in the short term, these actions are having a negative impact on our prepaid net adds. Together with the elevated disconnects and our SafeLink brand that Hans referenced, we expect pressure on prepaid net ads to increase in the second quarter before they abate later in the year.\nMoving on to the financials. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $32.9 billion, down 1.9% year-over-year primarily due to equipment revenue being lower by 9% as well as continued declines in business wireline services. Wireless service revenue was $18.9 billion, up 3.0% year-over-year.\nAs we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, results for the first quarter included a benefit of approximately 185 basis points associated with the large allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue. This benefit was partially offset by the impact associated with the shutdown of our 3G network completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The shutdown resulted in the removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections and the corresponding loss of revenue for the first quarter and beyond.\nWe continue to see pressure on service revenue from the cost of promotions and the amortization impact in the first quarter. Additionally, we see pressure from prepaid revenue as a result of lower subscribers versus prior year. To help offset these pressures, we've recently implemented additional pricing actions across our business and consumer segments. We expect to see the benefits of these actions ramp across the second quarter as the business segment began billing customers closer to the end of the first quarter, while consumers started earlier this month.\nAs a result of these combined pricing actions, we anticipate approximately $75 million of incremental quarterly revenue moving forward. Additionally, the consumer team is working to improve efficiencies around device promotions and credits that we expect to yield revenue benefits across the remainder of the year. We believe that the actions the teams are taking will grow the top line, driving both EBITDA and cash flow. To complement this, the team expects to make additional progress across 2023 on the development and implementation of cost efficiency initiatives, resulting in a meaningful savings run rate at the end of the year.\nDuring the first quarter, operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were down 2.4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volume which helped to offset an increase in bad debt of approximately $200 million. Similar to involuntary churn rates, bad debt expense reflects the return of collections to pre-pandemic levels. While up year-over-year, bad debt expense is relatively consistent with the prior quarter.\nCash flow from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $8.3 billion compared to $6.8 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, coupled with fewer upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns despite the current macroeconomic conditions. CapEx for the quarter came in at $6.0 billion, which includes most of the remaining $1.75 billion of C-band-related spending in our guidance.\nWith the conclusion of the program, we would expect a step down in the pacing of overall CapEx throughout the remainder of the year and continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $2.3 billion up $1.3 billion versus last year. Total unsecured debt for the quarter was $132.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2022 and $5.3 billion lower year-over-year. This resulted in net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x as of the end of the first quarter. A 0.1x improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat from the prior quarter.\nWe continue to have very low near-term unsecured debt maturities with the only maturity remaining in 2023 and being approximately $600 million due in the second quarter. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be my last earnings call as Verizon's CFO. It has been a fulfilling 10 years at Verizon and a privilege to serve as CFO, and I'm thankful to everyone that has made it such a rewarding experience.\nFrom our talented finance team to my fellow executive team members to all of you that have had the pleasure of getting to know I want to say thank you. Verizon is in good hands with Tony as its CFO. I've worked closely with him since my first day at the company, and I know he will always strive to drive the business forward in a way that puts Verizon and its shareholders first. I truly look forward to seeing what he and the entire Verizon team will achieve as I cheer them on from the sidelines as an enthusiastic customer and shareholder.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to your questions.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. In summary, our disciplined approach has led to significant progress on our key strategic plans and we need to keep the momentum and focus going. We're pleased with how 2023 has started. We continue to deliver the best customer experience on the most reliable network supported by the best people in the industry. In mobility, our segmented and surgical approach to the market is working, and we are taking pricing actions where possible.\nIn broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we continue to capture market share. We'll continue to grow our cash generation profile and maximum shareholder returns aided by our cost efficiency program and lowered capital expenditures. I remain confident in our strategy and our strong focus on execution. We are always identifying new ways to evolve our business and execute on opportunities. In everything we do, we focus on driving profitable growth. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders for our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow.\nBrady, over for the questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nEarlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. I hope you all had a chance to read the material. I'm going to briefly discuss the financial highlights before turning the call over to Hans to lead a discussion on our strategy, guidance and forward-looking view of the business.\nSlide 3 shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth quarter total postpaid net additions in 7 years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full quarter contribution from TracFone.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.\nLet me start by saying that we delivered against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter.\nLast quarter, we set the expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023. The improvement in the consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with Fios result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade, and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year.\nRegarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-Band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvements and take even more action that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call.\nThe industry enters 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment.\nWe measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these 3 metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We are well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect that wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributors to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-Band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years.\nWe are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business. Adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable, long-term growth and profitability.\nAs connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are architected and built the same nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different. Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years.\nIn the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-Band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POPs targeted by year-end 2024. C-Band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-Band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-Band spectrum later this year.\nDue to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest usage areas first with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience.\nAnd where we have built out the C-Band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have been limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in these markets has been encouraging as evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake. In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-Band. With the final tranche of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire continental U.S.\nWhen we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G stand-alone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink, and positioned to deliver 5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G NR, among others.\nWe believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase we're expecting in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect that we'll have 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans.\nOur mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving that level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of service and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our Fios footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our Fios open for sales to more than 17 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead.\nIn summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth, and all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against 3 important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all 3 of these benchmarks.\nWe expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wireless access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assumed leadership of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and planned initiatives.\nAfter integrating TracFone over the last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefits from these actions.\nIn 2023, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive the plan that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market.\nFinally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer base.\nScaling of new business such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we are making the appropriate investments to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry.\nYou can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financials for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability, and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business.\nMoving to Business wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin revenue in order to again drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out on some revenue, it is the right move and one that will lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies.\nYou may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. A component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system, among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025. So our EBITDA strategy is clear: grow profitable volumes in both Consumer and Business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do.\nBy growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth.\nWe believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders.\nAnd as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx levels by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years.\nWith that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance.\n\nMatt Ellis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term outlook.\nOur 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total wireless service revenues to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022.\nAs noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees, which partially recover network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other revenue. In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses.\nFull year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolio.\nWe continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment. Higher rates for pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense in our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation expense, primarily driven by the C-Band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23.\nOur adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-Band-related capital spending. And we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year, after which all C-Band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program.\nLooking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022, we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash flow in subsequent years.\nI will now turn it back over to Hans.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market, and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year.\nBy that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.",

Earnings Call\n\nVZNYSEOCT 21, 8:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nNow let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.17 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported third quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $881 million. This includes a net pretax charge of approximately $645 million, primarily related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $236 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.32 in the third quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last quarter, we told you we would take actions. Today, I'm here to share the results those actions have delivered.\nWe ended the third quarter with wireless service revenue growth up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. And adjusted EBITDA grew sequentially by almost 3% to $12.2 billion. We had total phone gross adds of nearly 2.6 million and about 5% year-over-year increase. This includes an increase in Consumer of 1.3%, a significant improvement from minus 11% in the second quarter.\nThese results are early indicators that the actions we are taking across our businesses to build momentum are gaining traction. Of course, we're not done yet. I continue to work with my team to take actions to grow revenue and to take cost out of our business to unlock the full potential of Verizon. I'm glad to see sequential improvements based on our efforts, but there is more to do. Based on our momentum and plans, our financial guidance for 2022 remains unchanged.\nThroughout the call, you'll hear the actions we took and the impact they've had on our business to position Verizon for growth. Our pricing actions in the second quarter in both our Consumer and Business groups helped increase our wireless service revenue. Postpaid phone net adds came in 8,000 for the quarter with a loss from Consumer offset by gains in Verizon Business. Matt will share more details with you later in the call.\nLet me turn to some of our group results. In Consumer, we have started to gain traction with customers reacting positively to our new offerings, and as a result, increased store traffic. Our Welcome plan improved customers' pricing perception and contributed to consumer phone gross adds being up year-over-year.\nWith the launch of the iPhone 14, we delivered a first-of-its-kind Apple 1 Unlimited bundle. Verizon customers now have access to Apple services all under one subscription. Apple remains a unique and trusted partner of Verizon because they recognize our network quality and high-value customers.\nIn the value segment, we launched Total By Verizon, redefining no contract wireless service, a key step in our continued integration of TracFone. And just this week, we introduced a prepaid wireless home Internet service on our Straight Talk brand. We continue to expand our offerings in the value segment, and customers are taking notice. This helped also generate positive prepaid net adds for the quarter, our first positive quarter since second quarter 2021.\nFor postpaid, we're focused on attracting and retaining high-quality consumers in a disciplined and measured approach. As we see areas of opportunity, we will address them in a surgical manner just like we have done with some of our recent actions. There is more progress to make. Our premium strategy is working.\nWe ended the third quarter with 53% of our customers having a 5G phone, and 81% of our base is on Unlimited plans. With a 42% uptake on premium unlimited, there's a great opportunity for step-ups. And we see that demand with approximately 60% of our new customers choosing Premium Unlimited right from the start. It is clear we have a high-quality customer base, so we will continue to focus on retention and winning these comers.\nMoving to Verizon Business. We see a continued very good momentum in both fixed wireless access and mobility. And I'm encouraged also by the large 5G infrastructure deals we made in the quarter. These include digital transformation projects with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Fujifilm and our continued work with the Department of Defense.\nAnd this is just a start. We recently announced an important agreement with the U.S. Department of State to modernize its communications infrastructure across embassies and other locations around the world. I'm proud that we are part of choice for these global enterprises and public sector clients.\nIn broadband, our fixed wireless access and fire service continued to see strong demand. Total broadband net adds were 377,000, a sequential growth of over 40%. All of these services are built to deliver on top of our world-class network. We have a premium network and experience that our customers value and that demand's premium pricing.\nOur network is a core value proposition. America relies on us, and we deliver. This was evident before, during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. Our team did what we always do: we ran to the crisis, quickly restoring our network as needed and using our technology solution to protect impacted areas. Bottom line, our network infrastructure was resilient, and our people delivered in the way that you have come to expect from us.\nOur mission has always been to build and operate the best, most reliable, highest-performing network. Our use of advanced technologies, our spectrum portfolio and our expansive own fiber footprint are critical to achieving that goal. Where we deploy our C-band, we see direct correlation to customer growth on both mobility and fixed wireless access. We are currently covering over 160 million POPs with C-band and on track to deliver 200 million within the first quarter of 2023.\nC-band usage is up 170% quarter-over-quarter, and fixed wireless access now covers more than 40 million households. Right now, more than 48% of our cell sites are connected by Verizon's own fiber. We're expecting to be about 50% by year-end with the majority of our 5G sites already on our own fiber. This not only improves network performance but also improves our owners' economics.\nAt the same time, we're making efforts to take cost out of our business. We're constantly thinking about how we run our enterprise every day to enhance our performance while delivering on our strategy. In this period, we have designed a company-wide cost-savings program that we expect will save between $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025. A first step in these efforts is the creation of a global service organization under the leadership of Craig Silliman. This is one part of our larger program to leverage cross-functional opportunities across the business.\nOver the past 2 years, under unprecedented circumstances, we have learned a lot about how we deliver our services to customers. Verizon Global Services will help unlock significant efficiencies and reduce cost across the business. Keeping in line with our company values and strategy, we continue to practice financial discipline even in a competitive market and delivered solid financial performance quarter-over-quarter.\nVerizon is in a strong position, no matter economical environment with our high-quality customer base, diversified go-to-market options, including our value offering, the benefits from strengthening our organization through our cost-savings program and the best network that just keeps getting better.\nI will now hand it over to Matt to go deeper into our results.\n\nMatthew Ellis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Our results from the third quarter were not yet where we would like them to be. But as you heard from Hans, the actions we've taken in the past 2 quarters are gaining traction in the marketplace. As a result, we saw positive developments in store traffic and consumer phone gross adds, further gains in broadband and a sequential improvement in our financial results. We anticipate that we'll be able to build on this momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.\nLet's now walk through results from the third quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our strategy for mobility growth is to drive revenue growth by attracting and retaining high-quality customers and migrating them into premium tiers. Premium penetration in the consumer segment increased to approximately 42% at quarter end, a sequential increase in line with prior quarters even with the introduction of the Welcome plan and the current economic backdrop.\nAs a result of the continued increase in premium plan penetration, combined with the benefit from our admin fee increase and the impact from metered price-ups, consumer postpaid ARPA increased 3.8% year-over-year. Overall phone gross adds were up approximately 5% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in business as well as the improvement in consumer gross adds.\nWith the impact of 3Q churn, which increased as expected as a result of our recent pricing actions, phone net adds were 8,000 for the quarter.\nBusiness delivered 197,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter, their fifth consecutive quarter exceeding 150,000. The results were again balanced across the 3 customer groups with enterprise delivering their best-ever phone net add performance and SMB and public sector both seeing double-digit phone gross add growth.\nOn the Consumer side, postpaid phone gross adds were up 1.3% year-over-year, a notable sequential improvement from an 11% decline in Q2. The launch of the Welcome plan and the Apple One Unlimited plan helped to generate more store traffic while providing another avenue to compete outside of promotional spend. We have now seen year-over-year improvement in phone gross add performance for 4 consecutive months through September and anticipate another low single-digit year-over-year growth performance in the fourth quarter.\nAs expected, the pricing actions we took around administrative fees and metered plans led to an increase in disconnects. With certain price-ups being phased in throughout the third quarter, we would anticipate some disconnect pressure to carry over into Q4. Taken together, we currently expect the gross add and disconnect performance to result in positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter.\nLet's now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. Total broadband net adds were 377,000 in the quarter, reflecting a strong demand for reliable and high-value broadband offerings. Fixed wireless access momentum continued throughout the third quarter. We added 342,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in 2Q, reflecting increased demand across business and consumers. More than 75% of our consumer net adds are coming from urban and suburban locations with data usage that continues to mirror our first customers. We anticipate further share gains in this space as we continue to expand our household coverage and begin to realize benefits from our offering in the prepaid segment.\nWe also added 61,000 Fios Internet net adds during the third quarter, reflecting improved gross outperformance from Q2 as well as continued strong retention levels. Our ability to grow Fios in spite of some secular headwinds due to lower move activity shows that the quality, value and reliability that Fios offers continues to resonate strongly with customers.\nWe further expanded our nationwide broadband opportunity by adding more fixed wireless households and businesses covered as well as growing our Fios open for sale within our ILEC footprint. Total fixed wireless household coverage surpassed 40 million in the quarter, including over 30 million covered by 5G Ultra Wideband. Fios open for sale is now at 16.9 million, a year-to-date increase of 410,000, and we remain on track to hit our full year target of 550,000.\nNow let's talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our work to integrate TracFone continues, highlighted by the launch of our new prepaid brand, Total By Verizon, late in the quarter as well as the launch of fixed wireless for our prepaid customers earlier this month. For the quarter, we delivered positive prepaid net adds of 39,000, which excludes a base adjustment of 102,000 primarily relating to a competitor's 3G network shutdown. We saw significant improvement in TracFone's performance, which had positive net adds for the first time since Q1 2021.\nWith our current momentum, combined with the launch of our new brand and fixed wireless, we're excited about our positioning and ability to further grow in the value market, bringing more connectivity and benefits to customers in this space.\nNow let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was up 4.0% year-over-year as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue more than offset wireline declines and the net impact of last year's M&A activity. As a reminder, the third quarter last year only had 2 months of Verizon Media activity before its divestiture.\nTotal wireless service revenue growth was up 10.0% from the prior year, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, continued effectiveness of our Premium Unlimited strategy and business volumes. The core business is strong as wireless service revenue, excluding all TracFone activities, grew above 3%.\nAdditionally, we saw a benefit from the pricing actions taken earlier in the year, which we previously said would generate roughly $1 billion across Q3 and Q4. These actions helped to generate a sequential increase of $494 million in wireless service and other revenue and an increase of $345 million of adjusted EBITDA as total adjusted EBITDA came in at $12.2 billion for the quarter.\nWe continue to feel the pressures of higher device subsidies and promotional spending despite taking steps throughout Q3 to be disciplined, including the launch of the Welcome plan, which comes with our device subsidy. Inflationary pressures remain elevated both from a year-over-year and sequential point of view with the increase from Q2 primarily coming from higher electricity rates. Expectations for full year 2022 impacts of inflation remain consistent with comments during our Q2 earnings call.\nTo further mitigate inflation impacts, we have started a new cost-savings program that we expect will provide a reduction in annual cost of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2025. This program will be focused on several areas within the business, including digitalization efforts to enhance the customer experience and streamlining internal operations through automation and process enhancements. While part of this will benefit the bottom line, a portion of these savings will be reinvested into the business to help accelerate opportunities.\nAs Brady noted, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.32. In addition to the impact from EBITDA, this reflects sequential pressures in interest expense due to rate increases and a reduction in other income associated with noncash changes to pension and OPEB.\nBased on year-to-date interest rate increases and market expectations for additional Federal Reserve actions this year, we now estimate cash interest expense for 2022 to be about $400 million higher than our expectation coming into the year. We anticipate this pressure will continue into next year given the full year impact from interest rate increases, providing an EPS headwind in 2023. Likewise, the impact from noncash pension costs due to higher interest rates and lower return on assets this year is expected to put additional pressure on below-the-line items for 2023.\nNow let's take a look at our third quarter Consumer financial results. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.8% year-over-year driven by wireless service revenue growth of 11.0% as well as higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increases were the result of the inclusion of TracFone, core wireless service revenue growth and the impact of the pricing actions.\nTotal Fios revenue was up versus the same period a year ago by 0.3% as growth from our Internet base offset the revenue impact of a 9% year-over-year decline in video subscribers. Fios content costs have also dropped, resulting in an improved margin profile that we expect will continue to benefit from further shifts away from video.\nConsumer EBITDA was $10.6 billion, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year. The pricing actions as well as the full inclusion of TracFone results more than offset the pressures from higher promotional activity and the impact of inflation.\nNext, let's take a closer look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment's wireless results remained strong in 3Q, though wireline service revenue declines continued due to ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 5.7% was up from 3.0% last quarter, aided by pricing actions as well as continued growth in our customer base. Wireline revenue declined by 6.7% versus prior year. Operating trends are consistent with prior quarters though in Q3, we saw a sequential increase in USF revenue due to higher rates. Business EBITDA was $1.8 billion for the quarter, down 6.7% from the prior year. In addition to pressure from wireline, we experienced higher growth-related costs as wireless sales volumes were up by 15% from the prior year.\nNow let's move on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 quarters of 2022 totaled $28.2 billion compared with $31.2 billion in the prior year period as working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels continue, as we expected. Capital spending for the first 3 quarters of the year totaled $15.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to last year.\nC-band spending was $4.5 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $12.4 billion for the first 3 quarters of the year. We exited the quarter with $129.3 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $1.3 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x.\nAs Hans mentioned earlier, our low unsecured bond maturities over the remainder of this year and next and strong operational cash flow generation puts our balance sheet in a strong position. Payment trends remain at or better than pre-COVID levels, and the quality of our postpaid base has never been better as evidenced by recent asset-backed securities prospectus filings.\nAs we look at Q3 results, we delivered the sequential revenue and EBITDA growth that we had anticipated from the actions taken in 2Q. Our guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. We are building momentum and remain confident that our strategy will deliver strong cash flow growth into the future. It is this confidence, combined with the health of our balance sheet, that enabled us to recently increase our dividend for the 16th consecutive year. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders, and we intend to continue to put the Board in a position to approve annual increases.\nI will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. The actions we have taken are showing progress, but there's more work to be done. Our priorities through the end of the year and into 2023 are straightforward: continue our traction in Consumer wireless through the holiday season and into 2023; maintain and grow our momentum in fixed wireless access and Business wireless; implement the initial framework of a cross-functional efficiency program and improve our working capital efficiencies; and finally, continue our measured and strategic approach to the market with financial discipline and increased momentum for the quarters to come.\nWhile there's work to be done, I'm confident that we are well-positioned to deliver. So thank you. Now we're ready for your questions. Brady, back to you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.",

Earnings Call\n\nVZNYSEJUL 22, 8:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nNow let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.24 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $435 million, including a net pretax charge of approximately $198 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities.\nIn addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $237 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the second quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was not a good barometer for where Verizon has been or where it's going. While we are not satisfied with our performance, we know what the issues are, and we're already executing to reaccelerate in the second half of the year.\nAs I said in our first quarter earnings call and reiterated since, we're seeing weaker consumer wireless volumes. The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior, and we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention. The result was a significant impact on our gross adds.\nBased on our performance this quarter and analysis of the landscape, we're updating our financial guidance by lowering our expectation for service and other revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Matt will provide more detail in a few minutes.\nAs you know, we have already responded. Last week, we launched our Welcome Unlimited plan for Consumer wireless that will meet the needs of budget-conscious consumers without providing device subsidies. In addition to these new plans, we took pricing actions in both of our business units to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nIn Consumer, we also adjusted prices for some legacy metered plans, increasing revenue per plan while motivating step-ups to our Unlimited offerings. All of these actions position us for improved performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023.\nMore than ever, our leadership team is focused on executing our strategy through operational and customer-focused solutions. While I'm confident that we have the right strategy in place, we will continue to refine our approach as the consumer market evolves.\nLooking further into our business, we continue to see momentum that gives us confidence in our ability to improve performance over the long term. In our Consumer Group, we have consistently pursued a disciplined strategy of offering high-quality services at the competitive prices. We know the economic pressures that our customers are facing and are carefully bringing new offers to meet their needs.\nI'm personally working with the Consumer group to define our disciplined approach to the market while also looking closely at how we operate and do business. This is reflected in the plans and promotions we introduced in May, June and July.\nMix and Match continues to drive premium plan adoption, with 78% of our consumer base on Unlimited plans and 39% on Premium Unlimited. We have seen healthy step-ups for 5 consecutive quarters, which continues to drive ARPA growth, and there is room for more.\nWhile consumer budgets are becoming strained, we continue to find ways of delivering new valuable services while recognizing that the handset subsidies we're seeing in our industry are not sustainable long term. Our new Welcome Unlimited plan is a great example of this.\nWe have tailored offers for the full range of Consumer segment from premium to value across postpaid and prepaid to meet all consumer needs in this challenging market condition. In the prepaid value segment, our integration of TracFone is on schedule and provide us with another suite of offerings to bring consumers onto our network.\nOur fixed wireless access solution continues to bring us new connections. Across Consumer and Business, we increased fixed wireless net adds by 32% over the first quarter, driven by a 50% increase from our Consumer group.\nIn our Business group, we again delivered excellent wireless volumes, with 430,000 net adds, including 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. This marks our third consecutive quarter exceeding 200,000 wireless phone net adds.\nIn the Global Enterprise market, businesses, government agencies and other institutions continue to recognize the power of Verizon's network and the importance of digitalization. This week, we announced an over $400 million project with FPI to help the Bureau meet its global bandwidth demands. We will provide direct access to their development team, and we'll advise on system enhancements like cloud computing, video and imaging transmission and data applications.\nWe'll also offer private 5G solutions to optimize complex organizations. We recently partnered with the Virginia International Terminals to build a Private 5G network across its Seaports campus. This network is scalable to replace Wi-Fi with more secure connectivity.\nWe're seeing new opportunities and increased demand for these network solutions from enterprises and other organizations. Verizon is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the moment and provide the highest-quality private networks to these customers.\nPrivate networks are the gateway to mobile edge compute, which can deliver game-changing customer outcomes, including revenue growth, new customer experience and cost savings. During the second quarter, we expanded our MEC ecosystem by bringing AWS Wavelength zones to Nashville and Tampa and now reached 19 metro areas. This means that 75% of the U.S. population is now within 150 miles of Verizon's 5G Edge.\nIn partnership with Truist, we supported the launch of the 10,000-square foot (sic) [100,000-square foot] Innovation Technology Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a founding member of the Innovators in Residence program, we will help create a global hub for the development of 5G and MEC application in the Financial Service segment. This trend will continue to create growth opportunity for us across a range of industries, as we are a market leader in 5G private networks and in mobile edge compute.\nThe momentum in Verizon Business is a fitting send-off for Group CEO, Tami Erwin, who is ending her amazing 35-year career at Verizon. We promoted Sampath at the Verizon's Business CEO on July 1. Sampath brings over 2 decades of experience in digital networks, critical infrastructure protection and a deep understanding on how networks play a role in enterprise growth and global security. He has been part of the Verizon team for more than 8 years, and I know that he is the right leader to take Verizon Business forward.\nThe power of our network gives us the flexibility to meet the needs of our customers across Consumer and Business. The continued and speedy expansion of our network and capabilities creates agility and optionality within our larger strategy.\nWe ended the quarter with 135 million POPs covered by C-Band and remain on track to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of the year. With the early clearance that we announced in March, we're expanding service into an additional 30 markets and have started deploying 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in many markets across the U.S., almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G.\nWe're seeing the phenomenal performance we expected. Network usage is growing quickly, with C-Band users up 233% since the end of the first quarter and millimeter wave traffic up 49% year-to-date. Where C-Band is deployed, it accounts for more than 1/3 of our wireless traffic on average. Consumers are also equipped with the devices they need to use 5G. Currently, 47% of our consumer base has a 5G phone, and we expect that number to reach nearly 60% by year-end.\nOur already-best wireless network continues to earn recognition for its performance and dependability. This month, J.D. Power gave us the highest number of awards for network quality for the 29th time in a row. And RootMetrics recognized us for having the best overall network performance in the country for the 18th time in 9 years.\nTurning to the second half of the year. We will continue to listen to our customers and give them reason to sign up, stay and upgrade with us. This month, we also added, on top of our yearly business transformation, a multiyear program to enhance our efficiency measures and actuate the cost benefits delivered. This will ensure that our balance sheet remains strong for the market ahead.\nWe are on the horizon with the goal of growing our business and controlling costs. We will never shy away from investing a portion of our cost savings in our growth initiatives. We are confident in our ability to deliver both efficiency and growth while creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nBefore I turn it over to Matt to give you more details on our results and our outlook for the second half of the year, I want to mention that we reached a tentative deal with our unions to extend our collective bargaining agreement. This extension will provide us with labor stability focused on our customers and opportunities to grow our business over the next 4 years.\nBy that, I hand it over to Matt.\n\nMatt Ellis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As Hans said, this was a challenging quarter, and our results did not meet the expectations we have set for ourselves. We have implemented multiple actions to better position Verizon for the future. At the same time, we expect the market environment to continue to be very competitive for the remainder of 2022.\nBefore discussing our expectations for the remainder of the year, let's walk through results from the second quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our runway for mobility growth is predicated on driving our customer base into higher-value data plans, and we continue to make good progress in the second quarter.\nPremium penetration within our consumer base increased to 39% at quarter-end, and 57% of new accounts in the quarter selected Premium Unlimited. And step-ups within our existing base remained healthy. This activity helped drive a 2.4% year-over-year increase in Consumer postpaid ARPA.\nOur recent administrative fee increase and economic adjustment charge began to show on customers' bills in the last few days of the second quarter. And we expect close to a full quarter's benefit to revenue and ARPA trends in the third quarter while our metered price changes will be phased-in throughout the third quarter, which will provide an additional uplift.\nWe reported postpaid phone net adds of 12,000 in the second quarter as strong Business results more than offset softer Consumer performance. Business delivered 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand across all lines of the Business group as phone gross adds were up nearly 30% from the same period a year ago, and we expect this strong performance to continue.\nOn the Consumer side, postpaid phone net losses were 215,000 in the quarter and stemmed from 2 main drivers. First, churn increased by 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn contributed roughly half of the increase due to the expiration of state consumer protection policies and less stimulus funding. This was coupled with an 11% decline in phone gross adds from the prior year, driven by the competitive offerings in the marketplace.\nAs Hans indicated, we recently introduced a Welcome plan in order to drive demand for more price-conscious consumers, particularly as they make spending adjustments due to the effects of higher inflation. This new plan is well positioned to attract new customers, especially for those who bring their own device.\nIt is our most basic Unlimited offering with no device promotions or many of the other features available in Mix and Match Unlimited 2.0 plans. We reserve our most generous acquisition and retention offers for consumers willing to select our Premium Unlimited plans, and we believe that opportunities exist to better serve these high-value customers.\nUpgrade activity remained elevated throughout the quarter, reflecting loyalty within our core customer base while also serving to drive greater premium adoption. As a result, total postpaid phone activations across Consumer and Business were up 8% from the same period last year.\nLet's now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to scale and grow our nationwide broadband opportunity with additional expansion of fixed wireless households and businesses covered. In addition, we expanded Fios availability to an additional 150,000 homes during the quarter and are on track to achieve our target of 550,000 incremental homes open for sale in 2022.\nTotal broadband net adds were 268,000 in the quarter, an increase of 39,000 sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally softer quarter. Fixed wireless momentum accelerated as we added 256,000 subscribers in the quarter, up from 194,000 in 1Q. Fixed wireless net adds have increased every month throughout 2022, and we expect to continue that trend in the third quarter.\nWe also added 36,000 Fios Internet net adds during the second quarter. While Fios Internet churn remains well below pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing softer gross adds due to lower-than-expected switching activity from moves and fewer new home purchases. We recently introduced Fios Mix and Match 3.0 that aligns our Fios and fixed wireless pricing and better positions us to grow joint account penetration.\nNow let's talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our integration of TracFone is on track, and the team remains focused on enhancing the customer value proposition and delivering cost synergies through migrating off-net customers onto the Verizon network.\nOur TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 227,000 in the second quarter, and total Verizon prepaid net losses were 229,000. These results exclude a base adjustment of 402,000 related to a competitor's 3G shutdown. Our prepaid volumes were impacted by aggressive postpaid promotions. As we made progress on our TracFone integration initiatives, we will be better positioned to serve those customers wanting to migrate to postpaid offerings.\nOur business case had anticipated subscriber losses during the early phase of the integration period, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. However, should customer preferences shift to the value market and make recessionary concerns, we would expect to see some benefits. Prepaid ARPU was $31.26 in the quarter, up modestly on a sequential basis, and we expect it to remain stable going forward.\nNow let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was relatively flat year-over-year as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue were offset primarily by wireline declines and the net impacts of last year's M&A activity. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.1%, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, further progress on our Premium Unlimited strategy and strong Business volumes.\nService and other revenue was down 3.9% for the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion for the quarter, down 2.6% year-over-year due to the divestiture of Verizon Media, higher device subsidies and promotional spending associated with the increased wireless activations, wireline revenue declines and inflationary cost pressures.\nRegarding inflation, we are seeing the pressures within our cost structure, most notably on labor costs, utilities and transportation and logistics expenses. We expect these pressures to accelerate in the second half of the year and have an impact on profitability and earnings.\nAs Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.31, down 5.8% from the prior year. This primarily reflects the impact of our adjusted EBITDA results and higher D&A related to our C-Band rollout.\nNow let's take a look at our second quarter Consumer financial results. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 9.1% year-over-year, driven by the inclusion of TracFone, higher equipment revenue and core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 10.5% year-over-year, also driven by the inclusion of TracFone and postpaid ARPU growth.\nTotal Fios revenue was flat versus the same period a year ago as Internet growth was offset by video and voice declines. Consumer EBITDA was $10.4 billion, down 0.3% compared to the same period last year. A higher contribution from TracFone was more than offset primarily by higher promotional activity. Consumer EBITDA margin was 40.5% in the quarter.\nNow let's take a close look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment's wireless results remained strong in 2Q, while wireline service declines continued amid a softening economy and ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 3.0% was up from 2.1% last quarter.\nSmall and Medium Business continued its strong momentum, accelerating growth for the second consecutive quarter, while Global Enterprise had its best performance since the first quarter of 2020. Business wireline declines were elevated this quarter, in part due to foreign currency and federal USF, which together impacted growth by more than 300 basis points year-over-year. The secular pressures from technology migration continued to weigh on legacy voice and data services, and we expect this trend to continue.\nBusiness EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year. In addition to wireline revenue declines, we experienced elevated device subsidies related to the 15% year-over-year increase in wireless activations in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 22.9% in the second quarter.\nMoving on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 totaled $17.7 billion compared with $20.4 billion in the prior year period. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels as part of our supply chain management in the current environment.\nCapital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.5 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $2.8 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $7.2 billion for the first half of the year.\nWe exited the quarter with $130.6 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $5 billion resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. In a period of rising interest rates, our balance sheet is in a strong position, with less than $2 billion of unsecured bonds maturing in the next 18 months.\nLastly, let's move to an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. We now expect wireless service revenue growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%, down from the prior 9% to 10% range. The pricing actions already implemented are expected to contribute approximately $1 billion in the second half of 2022.\nHowever, this benefit is expected to be offset by the accounting impact of promotional activity and the impact of lower net adds. As a result of the reduction in wireless service revenue expectations and anticipated ongoing wireline pressures, we now expect service and other revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to flat.\nWe are lowering our adjusted EBITDA growth expectations for the full year to a range of minus 1.5% to flat versus our prior range of 2% to 3%. This revised outlook accounts for higher levels of activations, driven by our promotional activity, inflation-driven costs that we discussed previously, the reduction in wireless service revenue and Business wireline revenue headwinds.\nOur guidance assumes Consumer EBITDA margin in 3Q to be similar to margins seen in the first half, with typical seasonality in 4Q. Business EBITDA margins in the second half of 2022 are expected to be in line with those reported in the first half of the year.\nFinally, we are lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 versus the prior $5.40 to $5.55 range. This view reflects the reduction in adjusted EBITDA as well as incremental cash interest expense versus our expectations at the beginning of the year of about $300 million for the full year compared with the $150 million to $200 million we estimated last quarter due to updated market expectations for additional Fed fund rate increases.\nFor CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion of C-Band-related spending. In closing, we are confident in our strategy and believe that our assets position us well to generate long-term shareholder value.\nI will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.\n\nHans Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. In summary, we view this quarter and second half challenges as short term. We have a strong and resilient business model that is well suited to deliver favorable financial results, even in uncertain economic times.\nIn this environment, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through improved revenue and profitability, with healthy cash generation that supports our network investments and dividend policy as well as a strong balance sheet. We also have the best team in the industry, and I know they are ready to deliver.\nThe actions we have taken in our Consumer business creates an opportunity to solidify Consumer performance. Those actions include new postpaid plans and our continued integration of TracFone. Fixed wireless access for both Consumer and Business has proven to be a powerful connectivity solution. We expect our nationwide broadband presence and our fixed wireless subscriber base to grow well into the future. We will continue to drive Business wireless subscription and expand our MEC ecosystem.\nTaken together, and combined with our accelerated efficiency work, our actions during the quarter address our competitive challenges. And we'll continue to listen to our customers and thoughtfully respond in the marketplace. Our second quarter initiatives are designed to strengthen our Network-as-a-Service capacity, which uses the power of our network to drive results from our 5 vectors of growth.\nThank you for all, and we're ready to take your questions. Brady, back to you.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for questions.",

Earnings Call\n\nVZNYSEAPR 22, 8:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter.\nIn the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.09 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion. This includes a pretax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.35 in the first quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Brady. Good morning, and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in March.\nDuring the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network-as-a-Service strategy. This strategy underpins our 5 vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and sets up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I'm pleased with the progress we made across our 5 vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered a solid start to the year, even in the face of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on.\nWith that, let's get into the results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our 4 stakeholders in the growing 5G economy.\nIt all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you've heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential pieces of the 21st century's infrastructure. We're already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our fixed wireless business in this quarter.\nAcross the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year, and we delivered our best Q1 full net add performance since 2018. Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade.\nWe continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our ultra wideband experience, while also accelerating and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which combined with our continued millimeter wave rollout further establish and strengthens our network leadership, with [route metrics] ranking us again as the most reliable 5G network in the United States, and we have just started with the C-Band deployment.\nAt the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra.\nThis is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like mix and match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon.\nJust this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our [last play] platform. We're empowering our customers to choose the services they need and we're delivering on it. Our (inaudible) focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated device upgrades from our customers.\nAs we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon for scale and execution. The world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry's role in building our future has never been more vital. Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry and drive growth across all of our 5 vectors.\nAs we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices. 5G device penetration is significant, and we expect it will reach 60% of our wireless consumers by the end of 2023, up from 40% at the end of the first quarter.\nLet me now talk about the momentum in our business group. Verizon Business Group continues to have a very strong momentum in wireless. I'm proud to report that [Tam] and her team delivered the best quarter on full net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just getting started. We're also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks.\nVerizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This quarter, we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles.\nThis IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We're also seeing very promising progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I'm also pleased to share that our C-Band launched an aggressive execution to generate nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings.\nTotal new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds. And this is not the one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and growing.\nIn the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the macroeconomic outlook. [Manon] and I are very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella.\nThe migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, (inaudible) and business to business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector, network monetization, with growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 million [POPs] covered at quarter end with C-Band.\nAs deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March. Where C-Band is deployed, 30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum.\nWe have achieved this network evolution in the face of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets.\nWe remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come to expect from our technology, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement of our 5G network as we work with 2 satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band.\nEarly spectrum clearance gives us the speed to market and accelerate the return on capital for our network investments. Having early access to these 30 major markets will support our entire business. It adds consumers and business to our addressable market. And we know from experience that we see customer interest for fixed wireless access as soon as it is available.\nOur network expansion also supports our mission of digital inclusion, which is key to how we serve our 4 stakeholders and execute our strategy according to responsible business practices.\nLet me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third [] offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue our long-term carbon footprint goals, as described in previous quarters and in our ESG report.\nThird parties have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. telecom competitors. As always, what it means to be a responsible business depends on global conditions. I'm proud of Verizon's relief efforts to support Ukraine, including extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war.\nTaken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment year and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets.\nNow I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance.\n\nMatthew D. Ellis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and making investments to position Verizon for the long term. And this quarter, we made progress along that path.\nAt that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and we expect to get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our 5 growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next 4 years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband, and our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects.\nOur consumer and business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and subscribers and accounts. We've talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step-ups to higher value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year positioning us for high-quality revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum drove our premium penetration up to 36%.\nWith respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our business team, which contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the units since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength in the 3 wireless customer groups as SMB, enterprise and public sector each delivered double-digit phone gross add growth and extended the momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre-pandemic environment.\nOn the consumer side, phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was steady, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to be competitive in the market. We are pleased with the quality of the business that we are writing and are confident in the value of the postpaid phone gross adds we are attracting. Our retail postpaid accounts at the end of Q1 across consumer and business are up 40,000 from last year.\nConsumer and business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband, and the total subscribers on our networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance Spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to deploy this spectrum from a full year sooner than expected unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million households and 14 million businesses with fixed wireless access by the end of 2025.\nThe addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well, with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra wideband and Fios service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5x our 4Q '21 performance. Consumers continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability and simplicity of installation of the FWA product, and businesses continue to recognize that FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs.\nFor total broadband, we registered 229,000 net adds, representing our highest net adds in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net adds within the quarter driven by record low levels of churn.\nNow let's move on to the MEC and B2B solutions sector. Tami and the team continue to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We're seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace.\nWith our investments in key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC as well as advance our deployments in private wireless and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities and we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term revenue growth within this space.\nNow let's talk about the value market. Q1 marks the first full quarter of TracFone included in our consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, prepaid subscribers and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because TracPhone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure, specifically in the Tracfone brands, in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to the Affordable Connectivity Program, which negatively impacted ARPU as benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute on our strategy to bring additional value to this space.\nWhile we experienced certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first quarter volumes from TracFone that compares favorably to prior years excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were 80,000\nNext, let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our 5 vectors of growth.\nService and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion for the quarter, down year-over-year by 1.1% due in part to elevated marketing expenses.\nWe introduced our 5G Ultra campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA growth. Other items impacting Q1 EBITDA including the disposition of Verizon Media, which had EBITDA levels above those that TracFone added in the quarter, especially considering the investment we're starting to put into the TracFone brands. We expect marketing expenses to return to more normal levels in Q2, and we will begin to lap the prior year ramp-up in tower expenses which also represented a year-over-year pressure in Q1.\nAs Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom line performance shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability even in a period of significant investment as well as other headwinds.\nNow let's take a look at our consumer financial results in Q1. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by the first full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier; and growth within our non-connectivity products and services.\nMoving to Fios Services, we continue to see volume and rate gains is broadband offsetting pressures from video and voice as total Fios revenue grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion of TracFone as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter.\nSimilarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the legacy consumer business.\nNow let's take a closer look at the business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and service momentum within the business space alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led by momentum in our SMB group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter's 1.5%. And with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect business wireless service revenue growth to expand over the rest of 2022.\nBusiness EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction in high-margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes.\nLet's move to Slide 17, the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion compared with $9.7 billion from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impact as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivables and inventory increase as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion.\nThe continued build-out of One Fiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra wideband network greatly extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion.\nWe exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth green bond with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter, the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost long-term debt.\nWe ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8x, flat on a sequential basis as expected. Lastly, let's move to guidance for the remainder of the year. I want to provide some additional detail around our view of the macro environment in which we operate and give context around our guidance for 2022. We saw inflationary pressures building towards the end of the first quarter and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us are energy-related costs for our network operations and transportation as well as labor-related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties.\nWhile these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure and have the potential to drive additional expense pressures throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we have seen throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscape in which we compete. It is too early to predict how this changed landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last, but we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to achieve our long-term growth plans.\nThere has also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently. But as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt, approximately 75% to 80%, is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our earlier expectations of $150 million to $200 million.\nBased on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue to be approximately flat to 2021. Significant items affecting our service and other revenue include: [USF] rate reductions which are pressuring year-over-year revenue by several hundred million dollars; and softness in wireline sales.\nWe are keeping the guidance ranges of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Based upon our expectations around service and other revenue as well as the macroeconomic pressures, we now expect to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance ranges for these items. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital; and $5 billion to $6 billion for C-Band-related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during our Investor Day.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. Our priority for 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network as a Service strategy and to drive growth across all our 5 vectors. This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers, both from a customer experience perspective and for our future revenue growth.\nWe made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength, and we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy.\nNow we're ready to take your questions. Back to you, Brady.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Hans. Angela, we're ready for questions.",

Earnings Call\n\nVZNYSEJAN 25, 8:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nToday's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Brady Connor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\nAs a reminder, we are still in the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy.\nNow let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $5.32 per share on a GAAP basis.\nReported fourth quarter earnings include a net pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes a charge of $2.4 billion for the early extinguishment of debt, a $106 million charge related to severance, a $1.2 billion credit pertaining to the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities and a net gain of $131 million primarily related to the disposition of an investment.\nExcluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the fourth quarter and $5.39 for the full year.\nWe completed the acquisition of TracFone on November 23. The revenue associated with TracFone this year was approximately $700 million higher than the revenue received from TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2020. All of this revenue flows through our consumer group.\nAs noted in our press release this morning, beginning in 2022, our adjusted earnings per share will exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For 2021, such intangible amortization negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.11. And for 2022, we anticipate the impact to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19.\nFinally, we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day event on March 3 in New York City, where our leadership team will provide further details on our company's exciting plans for this year and beyond.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of 2021.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Brady, and happy new year to all of you. This past week has been one of the best since I joined Verizon. On January 19, we successfully launched 5G ultra wideband on C-band, which will enable more Americans than ever before to experience a transformative speed, reliability and power of our multipurpose network on the go, in their home or for their businesses.\nOur work throughout 2021 brought us to this moment, and I will spend this call discussing how we got here and how our accomplishment will accelerate our growth. I want to thank our incredible V team for all your hard work and dedication throughout 2021 and for delivering for our customers and our communities. We have never executed so well on so many strategic and operational objectives as we did in 2021. This was a catalyst year for Verizon, and I'm very proud of our work. We have a clear and disciplined strategy based on our multipurpose network that creates economies of scale and new business models in an area where broadband is essential to our customers and society. Our results clearly confirm that our strategy is working and that 2021 was a transformative year for Verizon, and it clearly sets us up for a high impact year in 2022. We have now some industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-quality assets, leveraging our best-in-class technology to extend our network leadership to address more opportunities than anyone else in the market.\nWe're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished and for the 28th time in a row, J.D. Power ranked Verizon first for network quality. This is our fifth J.D. Power Network Quality Award in 18 years. At the same time, we continue to support our 4 stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees and society as a responsible business. Verizon leads the industry in sustainability. We are ranked ahead of our peers, both by the (inaudible) and Just 100, and we are confident that our multi-stakeholder strategy will lead to long-term shareholder value.\nWe have a team and expertise to lead the country into a vibrant mobile computing future. Verizon has the best engineers in the world, and they have built a world forward reliable and scalable network. This asset is the foundation and the catalyst for our accelerating growth. So we begin 2022 with a strong portfolio of assets. We're executing our 5G strategy, making great progress on our 5 vectors of growth and delivering a premier customer experience. This significant momentum sets us up for 2022 and beyond.\nLet me give an update on the financial and operation metrics. During 2021's first quarter, we set clear targets. As we close out 2021 and enter in 2022, I'm proud to report that we delivered on all of them plus some, and our achievements will only capitalize even greater value creation in 2022.\nOn our January 19 C-band deployment, we covered more than 90 million POPs and millions of homes in more than 1,700 cities, well ahead of plan on making excellent use of the incremental capital spend to augment and accelerate our business opportunities.\nToday, we cover more than 95 million POPs as the team is progressing also brought more than 15,000 additional 5G Ultra Wideband small cells in service, exceeding our annual goal and nearly doubling our total 5G millimeter wave presence increasing our fiber footprint to create a state-of-the-art multipurpose network. At our Investor Day last year, we said we would have 5% to 10% traffic in urban areas covered by millimeter wave. Today, we're almost at 10%, deepening our expectation. This confirms our millimeter wave strategy.\nAll this had stage for last week's Verizon Ultra Wideband launch. We're excited and pleased with what we have seen so far from customer reception to network performance. We have grown our network significantly. We finished 2021 with over 20 million households covered for our fixed wireless access solutions and T-band adds millions more homes.\nFor business, our initial C-band expansion will recover more than 1.7 million organizations with Verizon 5G business Internet across 900 cities. We will reach new retail and business clients by offering a breadth of plan options that make our capabilities relevant to their lives. Our new mix and match 4.0 offerings allow customers to pick the 5G plan they want with options for savings on home Internet.\nFor businesses, we offer business unlimited offerings that bring choice and power to the professional market. In addition to our network achievements, we closed on 2 large strategic transactions in 2021. We sold Verizon Media Group to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion in a transaction that closed in September, retaining minority ownership. And in November, we completed our strategic acquisition of TracFone, positioning Verizon as the #1 provider within the value segment. This enable us to deepen our relationship with new customers while delivering more enhanced services.\nTracFone is being rapidly integrated into our operation. The acquisition added 20 million customers to our prepaid model and cements Verizon as a leading prepaid vendor at Walmart and Best Buy forming a strong foundation for our retail efforts.\nWe also continue to reach new customers through bundled Internet telephone and television services. Fios Internet adds in 2021 were our best since 2014, and we continue to expand availability of the best-in-class service.\nImportantly, we strengthened our relationship with our customers adding more connections, including more than 0.5 million new wireless postpaid phone net adds, while maintaining and cultivating our loyal, high-quality relationships. We provided additional value for our customers through our unique partnership strategy with the best brands that are meaningful to people, lives and businesses.\nThis includes content partnership with NFL, Disney, Apple, Discovery and (inaudible) to name a few. For businesses, we offer mobile edge compute capabilities, something we're first in the world with alongside industry leaders like AWS, Google and Microsoft. Disruptions to consumer and industrial life chains throughout 2021 and extending into this year have affected all industries and brought digital connectivity to the central focus in the lives of our stakeholders. That said, Verizon has executed effectively under discussion as demonstrated by our successful network expansion and network service launches. Once again, our financial performance demonstrate our strategy is working. Our focus on profitable volume continues to drive wireless service revenue growth of 4.7% in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, 74% of our customers subscribed to an unlimited plans compared to 71% in Q3. Just over 1/3 of our unlimited subscribers have unlimited premium. This leaves room for continued step-up expansion. Our multipurpose network and flexible plans will also encourage customers to upgrade handsets and devices. We saw quick adoption of 5G handsets throughout 2021 in anticipation of new services. 1/3 of our customers' handsets are now 5G-enabled compared to about 25% in the third quarter.\nWe raised our earnings per share and wireless service revenue guidance during the year and deliver on both including 10% EPS growth. We promised also $10 billion in cost savings, and we deliver ahead of schedule. However, we continuously strive to more efficiently manage our business. We generated strong cash flows to support our investments and financial commitment, and we delivered our 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payments while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. As for our focus on ESG, Verizon has also delivered on its promises. We took action towards meeting our 2025 goals, including spending to support technology education and adoption to bridge digital divide and contracting for significant renewable energy capacity, positioning the company to achieve over 50% renewable energy goal by 2025.\nMatt will elaborate on our performance and 2022 guidance in detail. But we will target organic service and other revenue of around 3% as well as EBITDA growth of 2% to 3%.\nWith the right assets in place and a sound strategy to reach consumers and businesses with 5G capabilities and mobile edge computing on our multipurpose network, Verizon has unlimited potential. 2022 will demonstrate this.\nNow I will turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in greater detail.\n\nMatthew D. Ellis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results where we continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance.\nBefore I get into the 2021 results, let me add my own congratulations to the Verizon team for achieving our C-band build targets well ahead of schedule and for the successful commercial launch week. The C-band deployment provides so many opportunities for us. As Hans mentioned, our strategy is working and these results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively to drive new high-quality customers to our platforms while also serving our best-in-class customer base. We do this with the financial discipline that enables us to deliver attractive service revenue growth and profitability as evidenced by another strong earnings performance with healthy cash generation. It starts with our award-winning networks, which enable both our consumer and business organizations to deliver the best products, services and experiences to customers.\nWith the acquisition of TracFone, the deployment of C-band spectrum, new mix and match plans and the trust the most innovative team in the industry, 2022 is positioned to be our best year yet.\nLet's take a look at these results beginning on Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, consolidated total revenue was $34.1 billion, down 1.8% from the prior year. Adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media Group on September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%, strong wireless service revenue growth and wireless equipment revenue were offset by continued declines in legacy wireline products. Total wireless service revenue was up 6.5% for the quarter. The results were driven by a combination of ARPU and volume growth, consistent with our strategy and the contribution from the Tracfone acquisition.\nFor the full year, wireless service revenue grew 4.7%, including Tracfone, and was in line with the increased guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter when adjusted for the Tracfone acquisition.\nTotal Fios revenue was $3.2 billion and grew 5.7% for the fourth quarter, driven by strong customer demand for our high-quality connectivity services. Full year FiOS revenue was approximately $12.7 billion, up 4.6% over the prior year. Service and other revenue grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, while on a reported basis, it declined 5.4% from the prior year.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $11.8 billion, relatively flat compared to last year as growth in Consumer was offset by declines in business and the impact of the Verizon Media Group sale.\nFull year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.4 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2%, down 50 basis points primarily due to higher equipment revenues.\nEarlier in the year and ahead of schedule, we achieved our $10 billion business excellent cost savings goal. We continue to drive efficiency in the business while operating with the best cost structure in the industry and expect strong operating leverage as we execute across all of our 5 vectors of growth.\nAs Brady mentioned, for the fourth quarter, asset EPS was $1.31, up 8.3% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our business. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $5.39 was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range and is a 10% increase over 2020 results.\nNow let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. The strength of our networks and brand, combined with our effective go-to-market strategy are driving improved competitive performance in the market. We continue to expand our high-quality mobility base with strong performance across consumer and business. At the same time, accelerating fixed wireless sales are complementing strong first results, expanding our broadband growth opportunity.\nFor the quarter, we delivered 558,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, an increase over the 279,000 achieved during the same period last year. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.81%, roughly in line with the same period last year and better than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the enduring loyalty of our customer base through ordinary and extraordinary times.\nTotal broadband net adds, which includes consumer and business Fios, DSL and fixed wireless totaled $106,000, up 30,000 from the prior year. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, another strong result. Even with a slight uptick in voluntary churn, we continue to experience exceptionally low fares Internet churn as customers trust the reliability of our network and the simplicity of our mix and match pricing. Our full year Internet net adds of 360,000 represented the best annual performance in 2014, and we now have 6.9 million Fios Internet customers.\nDemand for our fixed wireless access services continue to grow even before our C-band deployment. FWA net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products, totaled 78,000, up from 55,000 last quarter. This brings our total FWA customer base to approximately 223,000 at the end of the year.\nNow let's turn to our consumer group results. Fourth quarter represented another strong financial performance for consumer, highlighted by our best FiOS revenue growth in the 2.0 area, wireless service revenue momentum and healthy profitability. We are clearing the benefits of our focused go-to-market organization. Consumer operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $25.7 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year. Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up 5.2% versus the prior year due to strong wireless and FiOS revenue growth and a partial quarter contribution from TracFone.\nAs Brady mentioned, the net revenue chain TracFone was approximately $700 million in the quarter, which included incremental service revenue of approximately $500 million year-over-year.\nFor the full year, total consumer revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago to $95.3 billion, and service and other revenue rose 3.4% to $75.5 billion. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% to $14.6 billion, reflecting ongoing step-ups into unlimited and premium plans as well as the contribution from TracFone.\nPostpaid ARPA increased 3.2% from the year ago period driven by a higher premium unlimited mix and growth in products and services, such as content, cloud and device protection plans.\nFor the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $56.1 billion, up 4.7% from 2020 levels. Consumer FiOS revenue totaled $2.9 billion for the fourth, quarter up 5.6% from the year-ago period driven primarily by the strong growth in our broadband base.\nFor the quarter, EBITDA was $10.3 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year or more than $400 million, driven by the service revenue growth. Margins were 40.3%, down 20 basis points from last year due to higher equipment revenues associated with increased volumes. For the full year, EBITDA was $41.6 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion or 3.4% versus the prior year. Margins were 43.7%, down from 45.5% in the prior year as a result of the approximately 28% equipment revenue growth in the year.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our consumer operating metrics. Our flexible mix and match plans are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy, supporting continued strong demand for higher tier premium mobility and broadband offerings. Postpaid phone net adds were $336,000 in the quarter. We competed effectively during the holiday season, even as the switcher pool remains soft compared to pre-pandemic levels due to elevated retention promotions in the marketplace. Fourth quarter phone gross and were up approximately 11% compared to the same period last year, but were approximately 15% lower than the 2019 level. We continue to achieve customer retention with postpaid phone churn of 0.77% for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the same period last year and well below pre-pandemic levels even as trading volumes pick back up. We maintained the momentum of attracting high-quality customers with approximately 60% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan and over 1/3 of our base accounts now on a premium unlimited tier. 5G penetration continued to expand with approximately 34% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device at year-end. We expect to drive further 5G ultra wideband adoption with the launch last week of our C-band spectrum to more than 90 million POPs, combined with our updated mix and match offerings introduced earlier this month.\nWith the close of the acquisition, TracFone results are now included in consumer prepaid. We finished the year as the nation's leading value segment provider with approximately 24 million total prepaid customers including the approximately 20 million customers acquired from Tracfone. For the quarter, prepaid net customer losses totaled $85,000, which included 52,000 net losses on the phone businesses stemming from stronger demand for postpaid plans due to promos in that segment, coupled with handset supply constraint.\nNow let's move to Slide 10 to review the business group results. Operating revenue for the business segment was $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.0% year-over-year. We faced elevated pressures in the quarter in both public sector and wholesale, and we expect these pressures to moderate in 2022.\nFull year operating revenue was $31.0 billion, up slightly year-over-year driven by strong wireless performance. Wireless service revenue increased 1.5% and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter. Wireless service revenue was driven by growth in small and medium business and enterprise performance improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and was the highest growth since the start of the pandemic. While this was partially offset by a decline in public sector due to the elevated distance learning activity in the year ago period, our Verizon frontline campaign is resonating with stakeholders, helping drive new customer growth. Wireline trends remain under pressure as we continue to face prior year comps that included pandemic buying.\nIn addition, approximately 1/3 of our declines came from voice services where we continue to feel the impact of our strategic initiative to exit the low-margin international sale voice market. Business segment EBITDA was $1.8 billion, down 7.4% from the same quarter last year. Business segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, reflecting pressure in legacy wireline products and our commitment to invest in new product growth and drive customer demand for our wireless solutions. Full year margins were 24.2%, down 120 basis points from last year.\nWe exited the year with strong momentum in business activity and demand for our wireless products. With the recent launch of our C-band spectrum, we are in an even better position to serve the 5G needs of our business customers throughout 2022.\nFor the quarter, phone gross adds were up approximately 22% year-over-year and 8% from 4Q 2019 levels. The fourth quarter represented the strongest quarterly phone gross add performance for small and medium business and enterprise since launching Verizon 2.0.\nSegment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, which was up slightly over the prior year. As a result, total postpaid phone net adds were $222,000, our best quarterly performance since the onset of the pandemic.\nNow let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. Cash generation remains strong for 2021 as we achieved our financial targets and executed on our capital allocation plan. We spent over $45 billion of C-band spectrum and expanded our portfolio with the TracFone acquisition, all while increasing our dividend for the 15th straight year and making progress to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $39.5 billion for the year, a decline of $2.2 billion. This result primarily reflects strong performance in the business with increased adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, offset by higher working capital from device payment receivables and slightly higher cash taxes.\nCapital spending in 2021 totaled $20.3 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while initiating the first phase of C-band deployment covering 19 million POPs. C-band-related CapEx was approximately $2.1 billion in 2021.\nAs a result, free cash flow for the full year was $19.3 billion, down from $23.6 billion in 2020.\nThe highlights of our financing activity in 2021 was efficiently funding our C-band spectrum investment in the first quarter. Since then, we are focused on further optimizing our cash position and debt maturity profile with activity to reduce or extend near-term maturities, while deploying excess cash to retire longer-dated high-coupon bonds.\nWe accomplished this while maintaining ample flexibility to invest in our business such as fund in the recent Tracfone acquisition. We are also active with our ABS funding program to finance the increased device payment receivables as consumers upgrade to 5G phones.\nWe exited the year with $133.7 billion of net unsecured debt, a $3.7 billion reduction from the end of the first quarter. Our unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.8x at year-end, in line with our 2021 Investor Day guidance. Our financing activities over the past 2 years have reduced our average portfolio borrowing costs by about 1% as compared to 2019, albeit with higher debt levels.\nOur cash balance at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, down approximately $7.0 billion sequentially, bringing us back to normal levels.\nLet's move on to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2022. We have great momentum from the strong operating FiOS results last year and are well positioned heading into the new year, and that momentum is reflected in our guidance for 2022. We took many strategic actions to position the company for better growth and our increased guidance disclosures provide greater insight into our financial outlook.\nAt our Investor Day last year, we provided guidance of at least 3 service and other revenue for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, we expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3%.\nOn a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media Group and our ownership of Tracfone, service and other revenue growth is expected to range between 1.0% and 1.5%.\nSimilarly, on a reported basis, wireless service revenue growth for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10%, driven by growth from our tiered unlimited strategy, the impact of the TracFone acquisition, and a ramping fixed wireless access contribution.\nExcluding the impact of the TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3%.\nWe expect total adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3% in 2022, driven by top line growth and ongoing cost discipline. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $5.40 to $5.55. As the waterfall chart shows, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth, including a small positive net contribution from the TracFone and Media transactions to be offset by headwinds from below-the-line items. These items include approximately $0.15 from our C-band investment, including higher depreciation and lower capitalized interest as we put the spectrum into service, $0.07 share dilution as a result of shares issued in the TracFone acquisition, and other noncash impacts such as D&A and pension and OPEB expense. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% based on current legislation.\nCapital spending for the full year, excluding C-band, is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, a decrease from the $18.2 billion in 2021, and as we have started our progress towards lower capital intensity.\nC-band capital spend is anticipated to be between $5 billion to $6 billion as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations to deploying Phase II spectrum.\nFor 2022, cash flow from operations are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by increased working capital from device payment receivables as well as higher cash taxes. We are extremely excited for 2022 and expect it to be our biggest year yet. The second wave of 5G is here, and we are leading the way into the future of connectivity We have the necessary assets and strategy to unlock the full potential of our growth vectors.\nWith that, I will hand it over to Hans to discuss our 2022 strategic priorities.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nChairman & CEO, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. The assets are in place to make 2022 Verizon's best year yet. Coming off a catalyst year, we are excited to execute on our 5G growth and deliver the financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day back in March of last year.\nWe have clear priorities for the year. We will continue our legacy of disciplined execution and look forward to delivering against our operation and financial targets that Matt just outlined. We expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3% in 2022. And we also expect to increase EBITDA by 2% to 3%. We commit to strengthen and growing our core business and commercializing our unique assets. By combining our Verizon Alta wideband with the new mix and match plans, we can supercharge 5G ultra wideband adoption to enhance customer experiences and to increase average revenue per user.\nAt the same time, we will continue to expand our fixed wireless access positioning Verizon as a premier nationwide broadband provider. We believe that Verizon's fixed wire access offering will drive the next leg of broadband growth, increasing our market share and reach. We will innovate in our business of business offerings, bringing mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of Things from a vision to reality. You should continue to expect us to sign new clients and provide examples on how the mobile edge compute is addressing the complex needs of our customers. We will benefit from our leading position in the value segment. The integration of TracFone will form the basis of deep and productive relationships that can grow to meet our customers' changing needs throughout life.\nWe will continue to run Verizon as a purpose-driven organization. We will pursue C-band and 5G leadership because these technologies are critical for economic prosperity and driving innovation for all, not just for Verizon. We will continue to serve all of our stakeholders, shareholders, customers, employees and society.\nAnd lastly, I also hope to see you all again at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3.\nWith that, I hand it back to Brady.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nSVP of IR, Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.",

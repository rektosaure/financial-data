I'm Gary, and I'll be moderating today's call, which is being recorded. A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]\nNow Lauren Yett from Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Lauren.\n\nLauren Yett\n\nAdvisor of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks, after which we will move into Q&A. I am joined today by our President, CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Doxey.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results which excludes special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings press release. Our press release for the third quarter 2025 results and supplemental information, including our initiative highlights, were both issued yesterday afternoon and are available on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd now I am pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Lauren, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Third quarter was another story of continued strong execution across the board. Operational reliability, cost discipline and the delivery of initiatives against our transformational plan. Southwest continues to transform at a faster pace than ever before, and I'm pleased with the results of our strategic transformation that we saw during the third quarter and the quality of the initiatives delivered.\nBoth costs and revenue finished meaningfully ahead of expectations and the rollout and impact of our initiatives remain firmly on track. We began selling assigned an extra legroom seating in July, a major milestone for our customer experience and product changes. The rollout was smooth and while still early, we're right on track with our expectations and we're already seeing a 4-point improvement in customer Net Promoter Score on aircraft with this new configuration.\nAdditionally, we have continued to launch new products and services showing our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers, and our ability to execute quickly. Starting tomorrow, we will be offering free WiFi sponsored by our partner, T-Mobile, for our Rapid Rewards members. We continue to roll out our updated cabins with larger overhead bands [indiscernible] upgraded lighting and more. We expanded our distribution channels, launching a partnership with Priceline. We launched our new in-house vacation product, Getaways by Southwest. We announced a new partnership with EVA Air to provide customers more connection opportunities. We announced new markets, including the additions of Knoxville, Tennessee, St. Martin, Santa Rosa, California and our first ever flights to Alaska, servicing anchorage all to start in 2026 and we aren't done.\nWhile we don't have specifics to share today, we're actively looking at continued changes to widen our product offering for our customers, provide additional premium revenue opportunities and further enhance our Rapid Rewards loyalty program and co-brand economics, including things like premium seating, airport lounges and long-haul international destinations served by Southwest Airlines.\nAnd our customers are responding to these enhancements. Our brand Net Promoter Score has returned to the level seen prior to our policy changes announced in March and we are excited to deliver further enhancements as we improve the customer experience.\nOur strategic plan continues to progress well, and we're encouraged by the sustained outperformance of [indiscernible] revenue and the momentum across other key revenue and cost initiatives. We saw a clear positive inflection in the demand environment beginning in early July, which continued throughout the quarter, and we are proud to report record third quarter revenue performance. Looking to fourth quarter, we expect to deliver an all-time quarterly record revenue performance.\nWe maintained strong cost discipline across the organization, significantly beating our CASM-X guide for the quarter. We have identified additional cost-saving opportunities in the back half of the year and remain confident in our full year EBIT guidance range of $600 million to $800 million. We are entering the fourth quarter with confidence and anticipate meaningful margin expansion as the benefit from our initiatives continues to mature as we execute our transformational plan.\nOur people delivered a strong operational performance throughout the quarter. Their dedication, their resilience and the world-class hospitality continue to set Southwest apart. We've made measurable progress across nearly every key operational metrics since January, and we continue to lead the industry as we track our performance against the Wall Street Journal Airline scorecard.\nThese results stand out even more given the hurdles that we faced, including summer weather, ongoing ATC constraints and the full rollout of reduced turn times across many of our stations, and it's a testament to our operational excellence and the heart of our company.\nWhile we're not providing 2026 guidance today, we're excited about the opportunities ahead and confident in our strategy. In 2026, we expect to recognize even greater benefits from our portfolio of Southwest specific initiatives, including a full year of revenue from bank fees. We expect to deliver more than $1 billion of incremental EBIT from assigned an extra legroom seating in 2026 and hit full run rate of approximately $1.5 billion in 2027.\nWe will continue to be disciplined in our cost execution across the organization and expect that momentum to continue into 2026. It's just an exciting time at Southwest Airlines. We're transforming faster than ever before and the momentum is real.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew to share more on our revenue and operational performance.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Bob. I want to echo Bob's appreciation for our people. Their hard work and commitment enabled us to deliver an outstanding operation this quarter even in the face of early July weather challenges. We've come a long way over the past couple of years, working to enhance processes and technology and improve daily operations and better managed disruptions. A great example of this was in September when an external telecommunications issue in Dallas, impacted radar, radio and computer systems, triggering FAA ground stops at local airports. Despite our significant presence at Dallas Love Field Airport, we had just one cancellation, finishing second among all U.S. airlines for the day, including many that weren't directly affected by the issue.\nOur teams particularly those in the NOC and at the station, responded quickly and effectively, keeping our operations running smoothly and reliably. We know reliability is one of the biggest drivers of customer Net Promoter Scores and a primary driver of loyalty so it's critical that we continue to innovate and invest in both our operations and our people.\nThe demand environment inflected up in early July and sustained momentum throughout the quarter. The improved demand environment and our execution of our initiatives contributed to our record third quarter revenue and to be in the midpoint of our third quarter guide with RASM coming in at up 0.4%. Even with increased capacity from our strong operational results and our ability to prolong the selling of the 6 2-be-removed seats on our 737-700 aircraft.\nWe were pleased to see load factor up year-over-year in August, September and so far in October. And corporate travel demand improved sequentially with a particularly strong September where we saw multipoint passenger growth. We're also seeing great traction with our loyalty program and co-brand credit card enhancements, which align with our new product offerings and incentivize everyday spending. Third quarter royalty revenue was up 7% and we saw double-digit growth in co-brand card acquisitions year-over-year. Our recent 100,000 point promotion saw the highest acquisition activity in over 5 years, signaling that these enhancements are resonating with customers and driving increased engagement.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect RASM to be in the range of up 1% to 3%. This outlook assumes the positive inflection in demand we've seen across the industry since early July remains at current levels through the end of the quarter. It also reflects the planned acceleration from our initiatives, the approximate 2-point year-over-year increase in fourth quarter capacity since July and the recent observed impact of the government shutdown.\nTo the extent the demand strengthens beyond current levels, it will provide upside potential to our full year EBIT guide of $600 million to $800 million. We're planning for fourth quarter year-over-year capacity growth of approximately 6% which compares to a relatively [indiscernible] base in fourth quarter 2024 compared with fourth quarter 2023, plant capacity is up about 1%. This capacity level now contemplates further pushing out the retrofit timing of our entire 737-700 fleet to be completed in January without any impact to the planned operate date for seat assignments and extra legroom seating on January 27.\nA big shout out goes to our tech ops team for streamlining the time line to complete this work. allowing us to capture additional revenue in those 6 seats during the entire holiday period at almost no incremental cost.\nOn the product side, we launched the sale of assigned an extra legroom seating on July 29. While early bookings are in line with our expectations. We're seeing strong interest from customers and the trends are encouraging, including demand for our new products, fair product buy-up and ancillary seat sales. These offerings are helping us differentiate and enhance our products and drive incremental revenue. We feel confident in our ability to deliver more than $1 billion of incremental EBIT from assigned and extra legroom seating in 2026 and hit full run rate of $1.5 billion in 2027. We're proud of the progress we've made and excited about what's ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\n\nTom Doxey\n\nExecutive VP &CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and hello, everyone. As you've heard from both Bob and Andrew, our initiatives are on track for this year, and we expect further acceleration in contribution from these initiatives into the fourth quarter and into next year according to our plan. As you know, our continued performance on costs is a key element of our transformation, and I am pleased to once again report that we delivered strong cost performance this quarter, with CASM-X coming in at up 2.5%, beating the midpoint of our guide by 2 points, a strong beat with or without the capacity increase we saw in the quarter.\nWe continue to see broad-based cost discipline across the entire business. I should also emphasize that this is more about spending smartly than it is about simply cutting costs. We're simply pushing costs forward as evidenced by the customer, technology and operational investments being made across Southwest Airlines. This was a company-wide effort, and I want to thank our teams for their focus and execution.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we are expecting strong continued cost execution with CASM-X up in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% on capacity of approximately 6%, both on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the impact of expected book gains from fleet transactions in the fourth quarter of both years, which gives a more accurate view of the cost performance of the underlying base business, we expect CASM-X to be in the range of flat to up 1% year-over-year.\nTurning to fleet. Boeing continues to hit their delivery plan, and we've increased our 2025 delivery assumptions from 47 to 53 Boeing 737-8 aircraft. We received 8 aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and retired 16 aircraft from our fleet, including the sale of one 737-800 aircraft and plan to sell 4 additional 737-800 aircraft in the fourth quarter. We will continue to be opportunistic as we evaluate potential sale transactions from our existing fleet.\nWe continue to expect full year 2025 capital spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, which includes the additional aircraft deliveries expected this year as well as the expected proceeds from aircraft sales. We finished the quarter with $3 billion in cash, in line with our liquidity target of $4.5 billion, including our revolver and with a gross leverage ratio of 2.1x within our target range of 1 to 2.5x.\nWe also executed an accelerated share repurchase program in the amount of $250 million under the previously announced $2 billion authorization. We intend to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares based on market conditions. This reflects our continued confidence in our strategy and our commitment to returning value to shareholders.\nOverall, our third quarter performance was ahead of our expectations for cost, revenue and net income which is another key milestone as we execute our transformational plan. We're managing costs well, executing our initiatives, investing in our product and customer experience, running an industry-leading operation, maintaining a strong and efficient investment-grade balance sheet, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year EBIT guide of $600 million to $800 million.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Tom. As we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few key thoughts. First, the pace of change at Southwest is accelerating and at the same time, our execution has never been stronger. We're transforming our product, enhancing the customer experience and delivering meaningful financial improvement, all thanks to the incredible work of our people.\nSecond, we're confident in our ability to hit our fourth quarter and our full year guide. We built a strong foundation, and our initiatives are ramping as planned. The operational rollout of assigned an extra legroom seating has been smooth, and we're seeing encouraging early results.\nThird, we're not stopping here. We've continued to evolve our product, expand our network and lean into the customer experience. Free WiFi for Rapid Rewards member starts tomorrow. New markets are launching, and we're building momentum across the business. And while we aren't ready to share specifics just yet, work on the longer-term strategy to meet evolving customer preferences is well underway.\nFinally, I want to thank our employees once again. Their excellence and hospitality are unmatched, and they are the driving force behind our success. It's a very exciting time at Southwest Airlines. We're executing with urgency and purpose, and we're confident in the future we're building and the benefit it will provide for our shareholders. Thank you all for joining us today.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back to Lauren to start our Q&A."

I'm Gary, and I'll be moderating today's call, which is being recorded. A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions].\nNow Lauren [indiscernible] from Investor Relations will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Lauren.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you.

Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Lauren, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Southwest is on a transformational journey, the largest in our history as we work to evolve our product and deliver increased value for shareholders and more choice for our customers. Our plan remains on track, and I have high confidence in our transformational journey and the significant value it brings. And that value accelerates this year and then more meaningfully in 2026. Additionally, I'm happy to report that we are seeing signs of improvement in industry demand.\nChanges in enhancements are being implemented very rapidly. In first quarter, we amended our agreement with Chase. We implemented enhancements to our Rapid Rewards program and launched Expedia, which continues to exceed our expectations. We began 24-hour operations with our first Red Eye flights, and we launched our partnership with Icelandair. We accelerated our cost reduction plan and continue to execute very well on cost with broad-based cost discipline across the company.\nMoving to the second quarter. The pace and the quality of execution continued. We began charging checked bag fees. We reintroduced the expiration of flight credits and implemented our Basic Economy product and enhanced fare structure, which lays the foundation for meaningful product differentiation when assigned and premium seating become available. Those changes were announced in March and successfully launched in less than 100 days.\nI'm just extremely proud of our operations, commercial and technology teams for their work to support an exceptional operational rollout. The revenue contribution from bag fees has exceeded our expectations so far and we've experienced no negative impact to the operation.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we began retrofitting aircraft for extra legroom seating with about 1/4 of our fleet now modified.\nMoving on to the third quarter. Earlier this week, we announced that we will begin selling assigned and premium seating on July 29 for flights beginning on January 27. We announced service to St. Thomas, which will begin operation early next year. And just this morning, we announced new and enhanced benefits to our co-brand credit cards offered through Chase. These benefits line with our new product offering and are designed to incentivize increased spending with perks like more points for everyday spending on things like groceries, gas and dining purchases. And I'm pleased with the pace of the execution and we are not slowing down.\nOur initiatives will continue to roll up and to ramp, and we expect them to deliver a more meaningful contribution in the fourth quarter of this year and a much greater contribution in 2026 once we began operating a signed and premium seating along with this year's enhancements. And I want to reiterate that our current initiatives are not the endpoint in our product strategy and evolution. As we've stated before, we are committed to evolving further to meet the needs of our current and our future customers.\nTurning to the macro environment. Industry demand stabilized in the second quarter. And while it's early, our recent bookings show clear signs of improvement. This improving demand environment, along with moderated capacity in the industry and the accelerating ramp-up of the contribution from our Southwest specific initiatives provides a constructive backdrop for the second half of the year and into 2026. We have provided an updated full year EBIT guide of $600 million to $800 million and a reconciliation to our previous guide of $1.7 billion. This includes nearly a $1 billion drop from the precipitous decline in the macro environment as being felt by the industry, net of some inflection back up for the rest of the year and a $100 million decrease from higher fuel costs with our $1.8 billion portfolio of initiatives and relative domestic unit revenue outperformance continuing to drive incremental value for the year.\nOur updated full year EBIT guide still represents meaningful year-over-year improvement, and we continue to expect significant EBIT expansion in 2026 as the value contribution from our slate of initiatives continues to accelerate. On top of that, given our overweighting to the domestic market, we would expect to be an outsized beneficiary of any recovery in the domestic demand environment. Our strong and efficient investment-grade balance sheet continues to provide support and flexibility as well.\nUnderscoring the belief in our transformational plan, strong management execution, and the ability to deliver significant value for our shareholders, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program expected to be completed over a period of up to 2 years. Tom will provide insight into our strong capital allocation framework, which balances a strong and durable investment-grade balance sheet with the capacity for further share buybacks at what we believe are attractive levels.\nI'm very excited about the future that we're building here at Southwest, and we will continue executing on our plans with urgency and with purpose. Above all, I want to recognize our incredible employees for their excellence and their one-of-a-kind hospitality as we all work together to deliver on our vision. And with that, Andrew, I will turn it over to you.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Bob. I'll start by also recognizing our people for continuing to run an excellent operation. I'm especially proud that we led the industry in on-time performance for the first half of this year. We continue to have a strong completion factor, canceling fewer flights during irregular operations compared with our larger peers and recovering very quickly with little to no hangover the days that follow. I commend our teams for rising to the challenge during this transformational time.\nWe reached a key milestone with the launch of our basic economy products and check bag fees on May 28. A tremendous amount of work enabled that rollout, including training for our people on new policies and tools. The operational rollout was incredibly smooth. [indiscernible] changes in May was designed to set the foundation for our product differentiation, ahead of beginning to sell assigned premium seating. Today, the incentives to buy up are primarily flexibility and free check bags. We began selling the sign and premium team next week, more enhancement and choices will exist, allowing from incremental product differentiation for customers.\nAs we've previously shared, we did not see a measurable customer impact in the period between the announcement of these changes back in March and the implementation in late May. The day before the changes were implemented, we did see a modest pull forward in bookings. In the days following May 28, we experienced a temporary decline in bookings, primarily in basic economy. Starting from day 1, the team has worked continuously to optimize our approach to selling based economy. There has been an ongoing effort to optimize the product descriptions and the Basic Economy booking flow, which initially included barriers to booking basic economy that resulted in reductions in overall website conversion. We quickly refined the booking flow in product descriptions to reduce friction and bookings have returned to expected levels with promotional activity backfilling gaps from this brief period of lower conversion.\nThis resulted in an impact to second quarter 2025 year-over-year RASM of nearly 0.5 point. And we expect an impact to third quarter 2025 year-over-year RASM of approximately 1 point.\nMoving to checked bags, well over half of our customers are now flying on bookings made beginning May 28. We are encouraged to be seen higher-than-anticipated take rates for paid bags. At this early stage, we're already trending at the higher end of the bag revenue per passenger rate of our larger peers, which is in excess of our estimates. We've seen a modest increase in gate check bags as expected, but have experienced no negative impact to the operation. We prepared for this change by implementing new systems and processes, which has supported the exceptional operational rollout. For example, we're using a machine learning tool that protects the number of gate check bags need for each flight, which enables our teams to act early and keep the operation running smoothly.\nOverall, we're pleased with the product changes and look forward to the continued ramp of these initiatives according to our plan. We're excited to begin selling the sign and premium seat on Tuesday, and look forward to operating these new products beginning January 27. As Bob mentioned, we've modified about 1/4 of our fleet. We've already started to monetize these retrofit aircraft by notifying customers that will be on a flight with extra legroom seats and inviting them to take advantage of our existing upgraded boarding product.\nWe've been very pleased with our co-brand agreement with Chase, and we're excited about the new and enhanced benefits on our credit cards announced this morning, which align with our new product offering. New benefits include 1 free checked bag, pre-flight seat selection and upgrades to extra leg room with any fair bundle as well as earlier boarding. Even before these new products and card enhancements, we've seen increased sign-ups with our existing card.\nBeginning in our August schedule, we're providing more connecting opportunities to drive load factors. We still have the largest point-to-point network in the industry, but with additional connection options layered in, driving improved network utility and more options for our customers. The connection opportunities will vary by season, day of week and time of day with less structured connectivity and peak times. We're expanding our network and look forward to launching services in St. Thomas early next year. This is our first new destination to launch since 2021, and we expect to announce at least 2 more new destinations later this summer.\nWe recently announced our second airline partner, China Airlines, and plan to launch operations with them early next year. We also announced 3 new gateways for our Icelandair partnership, Pittsburgh, Orlando and Raleigh Durham, bringing us to a total of 6 gateways. We've made progress with the gateways [indiscernible] which is planned to launch this quarter. And through the combination of [indiscernible] while at the same time, improving the quality of our operation.\nAfter a steady trend of deteriorating demand starting in the first quarter, the macro environment stabilized at lower levels during the second quarter and resulted in 2Q RASM down 3.1% year-over-year, including the nearly 0.5 point impact from the decline in bookings following our May 28 policy changes. I'm pleased that we again outperformed our large industry peers on domestic unit revenue. Our 3Q RASM guide of down 2% to up 2% year-over-year, assumes a modest sequential improvement in demand includes roughly 1 point impact from decline in bookings following our May 28 policy change, a 1 point headwind from lapping last year's [indiscernible] incident and is partially mitigated by our initiatives continuing to ramp.\nLooking to 4Q RASM, we assume further sequential improvement from third quarter both from anticipated improvement in domestic leisure travel trends and accelerating incremental revenue from our initiatives continuing to ramp. We will provide more specific RASM guidance for the fourth quarter through our next earnings call.\nWe remain committed to our reduced capacity plan for this year with full year capacity up just 1% year-over-year, with trips down roughly 2% this year and the modest growth driven by our turn in Red Eye efficiency initiatives. We've made tremendous progress, and we're not slowing down. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\n\nTom Doxey\n\nExecutive VP &CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and hello, everyone. As you've heard from both Bob and Andrew, we remain on track for our slate of initiatives. We are reiterating our incremental initiative EBIT contribution targets of $1.8 billion in 2025 and $4.3 billion in 2026. Of the $1.8 billion initiative even in 2025, we have successfully executed and met our planned expectations in both the first and second quarter of the year, already realizing roughly 1/3 of this year's expected value. We continue to expect the remaining 2/3 of this year's EBIT contribution to be achieved in the back half of this year as the ramp of the initiatives continues to accelerate according to our product rollout and plan.\nWe feel confident in our ability to deliver against these targets and the Southwest specific levers we have to mitigate the current industry demand environment. We'd like to provide more detail into some of the early successes that we are seeing from several of our initiatives.\nFirst, check bags. As Andrew mentioned, we are already trending at the higher end of the bag revenue per passenger rate of our legacy peers. We currently estimate that checked bag fees will result in more than $350 million of EBIT for the full year 2025, which compares favorably to our initial estimates and has a run rate of approximately $1 billion of EBIT had it been in place for the full year. Second, we remain on track with our cost savings target of $370 million for 2025 based on actions we have taken to date. Most notably, the head count reductions in the first half of this year and the related salaries, wages and benefit savings and additional cost savings that have been identified. Leaders across our organization are highly engaged in our cost reduction plan and we are seeing cost discipline across the company.\nThird, the evolution of our marketing and distribution strategy, as Bob mentioned, bookings through our new channels have exceeded our expectations in particular, with Expedia, which now represents roughly 5% of our passenger volume and more than half of that 5% being customers that are net new to Southwest. These items, together with other initiatives, such as our loyalty program, earn and burn changes, our amended Chase deal, new credit card sign-ups, flight credit expiration, network changes, the creation of additional connection opportunities, redeye flying and more give us high confidence in our ability to achieve our target this year.\nAnd finally, our new Basic Economy product is now in place, and sets the stage for the additional product differentiation that will come from the operation of seat assignments and extra leg room seats that will start in January. We expect EBIT contribution to continue to increase into 2026 and as our current year initiatives mature and as we launch new initiatives. We're pleased to have provided the full year 2025 EBIT guidance that Bob walked you through and we'll remain focused on strong execution to drive meaningful EBIT expansion in 2026.\nTurning to nonfuel costs. Second quarter CASM-X came in at up 4.7%, near the midpoint of our guidance range. and included a headwind of roughly [ 0.5% ] from a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which was driven solely by the recent strong stock market performance. I am pleased with our management of controllable cost items in the second quarter.\nWe expect third quarter CASM-X to be in the range of up 3.5% to 5.5%, sequentially in line with the second quarter, but on a lower capacity base and includes roughly 0.5 point from aircraft retrofit costs to support our extra legroom seating with launches in 2026. And roughly a point of year-over-year pressure from the timing of engine overhaul expenses in the quarter.\nFourth quarter CASM-X, excluding the impact of book gains from fleet transactions in the fourth quarter of both years, is expected to be in the low single digits. As a reminder, we had a large sale leaseback transaction that resulted in a $92 million book gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also expect aircraft retrofit costs to drive up to a point of 4Q CASM-X pressure. We will provide more specific cost detail for the fourth quarter during our next earnings call. Overall, we are managing costs very well. And again, I am very pleased with our overall cost management and cost reduction efforts, which create good momentum as we head into 2026.\nMoving to fuel. We recently terminated our remaining hedge portfolio for cash proceeds of $40 million, which reduces our future premium expense through 2027. Further detail was included in yesterday's press release. We now have no active fuel derivative contracts and currently estimate third quarter fuel cost per gallon to be in the $2.40 to $2.50 range.\nTurning to fleet. We've updated our 2025 aircraft delivery assumption from 38 to 47 deliveries this year as Boeing continues to ramp up production. We continue to be encouraged by the progress being made by Boeing and are pleased to have received 17 aircraft deliveries in the second quarter. As we have previously communicated, additional deliveries of new aircraft give us increased fleet flexibility. As Bob and Andrew stated, we're committed to keeping our full year capacity growth at up about 1% this year. With these incremental deliveries, we now expect to retire roughly 55 aircraft in 2025, an increase of about 5 from the previous estimate, and this also includes five 737-800 aircraft that we expect to sell this year. And just recently, we also executed agreements for the sale of eight 737-800 aircraft that will occur in the first half of 2026.\nAnd we're in the process of negotiating additional sales transactions. We continue to expect 2025 capital spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, which includes the additional aircraft deliveries expected this year as well as the expected proceeds from aircraft sales.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We repurchased the remaining $1.5 billion under the previously announced $2.5 billion buyback and expect final settlement of shares to complete by the end of this month. We're pleased with the expected outcome of this program, having purchased shares at prices well below current levels. Completion of this share repurchase authorization effectively offsets the dilution from our common stock offering in May [ 2020 ]. And yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization which we expect to be completed over a period of up to 2 years, demonstrating our continued optimism around our plan.\nI'd also like to provide more detail on the capital allocation framework that we will use as a guide as we move forward, which will support our continued commitment to a strong and efficient investment-grade balance sheet. We will be shifting from a cash target to a liquidity target, which will be $4.5 billion, comprised of $3 billion in cash and an upsized revolver of $1.5 billion, which is an increase of $500 million from the previous revolver size. We completed the upsizing of the revolver earlier this week. This target provides appropriate liquidity levels to cover near-term business needs with access to additional liquidity available through a significant amount of unencumbered assets. We will target a gross leverage range of 1 to 2.5x adjusted debt, meaning gross debt plus operating leases to adjusted EBITDAR. After paying off $2.6 billion of debt from the prepayment of the first tranche of the payroll support program notes and the payoff of our convertible notes, we ended the quarter with leverage of 2.1x.\nWe will prioritize our use of capital to; one, continue to invest in the business; two, reduce leverage and maintain balance sheet strength; and three, provide returns to shareholders through repurchases or dividends through free cash flow, surplus cash or surplus debt capacity. And with that, I'll hand it back to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tom. Before we move on to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key points. First, we are performing well on a relative basis and are encouraged with the recent signs of improvement in the demand environment. We continue to execute on our initiatives. We had an exceptional operational rollout of bags in Basic, and we are making rapid progress to sell and operate a sign in premium seating, which will bring many of our initiatives together. Second, we are confident we have an appropriate capital allocation framework and guardrails in place to operate as efficiently as possible and maintain our relative balance sheet strength and position, which we view as a significant strategic advantage.\nFinally, we remain committed to the plan we have in place, including successful execution and implementation of our transformational initiatives. All of this is focused on controlling what we can control to not only deliver exceptional customer value and continued loyalty, but also restore the financial returns we are known for, while maintaining our unique and differentiated culture with much more to come as we roll out further enhancements to our product offering. And with that, I'll pass it back to Lauren to start our Q&A.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Bob. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question. We will now take the first question. ."

I'm Jamie, and I'll be moderating today's conference, which is being recorded. A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]\nNow Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jamie. Hello, everyone and welcome to Southwest Airlines First quarter 2025 earnings call. In just a moment we will share our prepared remarks after which we will move into Q&A.\nI'm joined today by our President and CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tom Doxey.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking\nstatements which are based on our current expectations and future performance. And our actual results could differ materially from expectation. Also we will reference our non-GAAP results which excludes special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings press release.\nOur press release with first quarter 2025 results and supplemental information, including our initiative highlights were both issued yesterday afternoon and are available on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd now I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Julia, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to welcome Tom to his first Southwest Airlines Earnings Call. We are very grateful to have you on the team, my friend.\nWell, last month, we announced a plan to transform our revenue strategy, improve our cost performance and deliver meaningfully improved financial results on an accelerated time line. Regardless of the economic environment, we remain focused on executing our strategic plan, which is a unique opportunity to Southwest and on controlling what we can control.\nWe are very encouraged by the results from the initiatives we implemented in the first quarter. Just to name and highlight a few, we amended our agreement with Chase, we implemented enhancements to our Rapid Rewards program, including introducing dynamic reward pricing, and we launched Expedia with results exceeding our expectations thus far. We also seamlessly implemented our turn time initiative in more stations, and we now have removed 5 minutes of turn time from scheduled in 19 stations while leading the industry in on-time performance. And importantly, we executed on unit costs and our overall cost reduction plan. Transformational change in the implementation of our initiatives will continue at a very rapid pace.\nNext month, we will begin offering a basic economy product and new fair structure supporting increased buy up. We'll start charging check bag fees and introduce the expiration of flight credits. We also remain on track to begin selling premium and assigned seating in the third quarter of this year for flights in the first quarter of 2026.\nIn the first quarter, the team did a fantastic job focusing on execution. Our operating revenue was a quarterly record at $6.4 billion as RASM increased 3.5% on all-time record yields. Despite industry weakness in domestic main cabin travel where we are currently more heavily weighted compared to our larger industry peers, we finished at the high end of our guidance range, outperforming on a relative basis and underscoring the team's strong revenue execution and early returns from our revenue management, distribution and network initiatives.\nCASM-X growth of 4.6% was materially better than our original guidance of up 7% to 9% and well below our revised guidance of approximately $6 million. Of course, the big topic on everyone's minds right now is the macroeconomic environment. As we shared last month, the year started out very strong. However, that changed and we saw demand weakened as the quarter progressed especially in leisure demand. Since that time, we have seen softer booking trends continue into the second quarter, which Andrew will cover in more detail here in just a moment.\nAmid the current macroeconomic uncertainty, it is very difficult to confidently forecast given recent and short-lived trends. Given this environment, we are not reiterating our full year 2025 and or our full year 2026 EBIT guide. However, we remain confident and committed to continued strong execution of our initiatives, and we are reaffirming our targets of $1.8 billion full year 2025 and $4.3 billion full year 2026 -- incremental EBIT contribution from those initiatives.\nAt Southwest, we are uniquely positioned in the industry given the transforming initiatives we have rolling out the rest of this year and into 2026, which should provide a significant benefit relative to our peers. Cost discipline is important in any environment. In an uncertain environment, it becomes paramount. I am very pleased that we are ahead of the game with our cost reduction plan. The cost work is going very well, and we saw proof of that in our first quarter CASM-X performance. Those cost reduction targets are still in place, and we continue to seek opportunities to further increase and accelerate savings.\nWe also had an already moderated capacity plan in place with full year 2025 planned ASM growth of 1% to 2%, with this growth driven entirely by our turn in RedEye efficiency initiatives. Given the current macroeconomic environment, we are being proactive and further reducing capacity in the second half of the year. These incremental schedule reductions are in progress, and we expect to reduce both third quarter and fourth quarter published schedules by roughly 8 points each bringing expected full year 2025 capacity down to roughly 1% year-over-year.\nWe are making these changes quickly to capture as many cost savings as possible. We will continue to evaluate and modify as needed with a focus on margin-accretive adjustments as we move through the rest of the year. As we manage through these challenging times, we will stay focused on our plan but will also stay nimble. We have significant flexibility, including fleet flexibility, and we benefit from the industry's strongest investment-grade balance sheet with significant unencumbered assets. All of this helps us navigate the current environment while continuing to evolve for our customers and create value for our shareholders.\nBefore I turn it over to Andrew, I want to say thank you to our people for their dedication and resilience and for the world-class hospitality they deliver day in and day out. Our people set us apart, and that cannot be duplicated.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob, and thanks to our people for their exceptional efforts, which enabled us to lead the industry in on-time performance and the few extreme delays, our best first quarter performance in both categories in 4 years. Our first quarter completion factor of 98.6% was our best in 12 years. And despite some tough winter weather, we ranked #1 in on-time percentage and #2 in completion factor on the day after winter storms. Huge progress from several years ago.\nWe've already covered our first quarter RASM performance, so I'll jump in with some color on second quarter RASM guide of flat to down 4% on capacity up in the range of 1% to 2%, both on a year-over-year basis. Our guidance range contemplates a continuation of the current environment with the largest impact coming from lower leisure travel demand. Corporate travel, excluding the small percentage from government, has also been softer, but stable.\nThe impact of Southwest is mitigated by our initiatives, which are more targeted yields in the first half of this year, and we'll begin targeting load factor in the back half of this year as we work to close our RASM gap to the industry through improving network connectivity opportunities and marketing and distribution initiatives. Sales of our initiatives are already live, and we're pleased with their performance. We expanded distribution to online travel agencies with the launch of Expedia in February, and our current performance is ahead of expectations. We're seeing better-than-anticipated booking volumes in this channel, similar to what we've seen in the metasearch tools.\nWe're very encouraged by the expanded customer base provided by this channel as many of these customers are new to Southwest or have not flown us in quite some time. We optimize our loyalty program to better align earn and burn rates and have seen no negative trend changes as a result, such as changes in either our credit card acquisitions or attrition.\nIn fact, we had our record first quarter spend in our co-branded credit card. We've received the necessary approvals and certifications for the MAX 8 and 737-800 aircraft retrofits and expect to begin retrofitting aircraft next month. Our turn time reduction initiative, which Bob mentioned, is now in place in 19 airports, including several of our mega stations like Dallas and Nashville. Reducing turn time generates more flying from each aircraft, increasing our capital efficiency -- and unlike normal utilization increases, which typically extend the day earlier and later, this does not increase the operating date, so it is favorable to RASM and CASM.\nAnd we launched RedEye in February with Hawaii RedEyes launched just this month. Our new initiatives launching next month include basic economy, flight credit expiration and bag fees. After announcing these changes, we saw no evidence of bookaway and real-time data. We've executed the turn in red eyes with no adverse operational impact and feel confident we'll be able to introduce bag fees next month with minimal disruption.\nSignificant planning is already underway in key areas of our operations, including our gate and lobby experience. customer care and package service. Our goal is to mitigate any potential impact to transaction times in the lobby as well as designing new processes to manage the increase in expected checked bags gate check bags, all while enabling our employees to continue to deliver incredible customer service. In addition, we are accelerating the installation of larger overhead bends in our aircraft.\nOutside the cost reduction plan, our largest initiatives at maturity are premium and assigned seating, bag fees and the loyalty program optimization. Flight credit exploration is also material, estimated to yield in excess of $100 million per year. In terms of the ramp, the benefits from loyalty are expected to provide the largest lift to our 2025 EBIT and will only partially be reflected in the second quarter.\nWe expect minimal contribution from imply based economy, bag fees and flight credit expiration in the second quarter given they only applied to flights booked on or after May 28. The incremental revenues from these initiatives will meaningfully ramp in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as we increasingly shift towards bookings made on or after May 28. We will continue to be urgent and deliberative at our execution. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas M. Nealon\n\nPresident, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Andrew. I'm happy to be joining my first earnings call today with Southwest. I have enjoyed getting to know our employees in break rooms, hangers and meeting rooms across our network, and I've enjoyed being on the road meeting with the investment community as well. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm encouraged and excited about the progress that we've made so far, and I'm optimistic about our opportunities and where we are headed. Starting with our nonfuel costs, first quarter CASM-X came in at 4.6%, beating our previously adjusted guidance of approximately 6%. This improvement was roughly split between a variety of smaller onetime items and a hyper focus on cost discipline across our entire organization.\nFor example, we reduced consulting and marketing expense and pulled back further on discretionary spend. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter unit costs to increase in the 3.5% to 5.5% range. We are pleased with the execution of our cost reduction plan thus far -- and the entire organization's commitment to efficiency.\nMoving to fuel. Market prices have been extremely volatile in response to the broader macro environment. Overall, we have seen prices fall, which has helped offset some of the softness we are seeing on the demand front. We currently estimate our second quarter fuel cost per gallon to be in the $2.20 to $2.30 range. We recently announced that we have discontinued our fuel hedging program and have no plans to add to our portfolio. We remain 45% hedged in second quarter and 47% hedged for the full year with hedge positions in place into 2027. We will be opportunistic in unwinding our existing positions based on market conditions.\nMoving to fleet. While we are not updating our previous assumption of 38 737 MAX 8 deliveries this year, we are increasingly optimistic about what we are seeing at Boeing and their ability to deliver. As we shared in January, we anticipate retiring roughly 50 aircraft during 2025. As a reminder, we will continue to opportunistically transact on aircraft in our existing fleet based on actual aircraft deliveries, market conditions and other factors.\nAs such, we continue to expect 2025 gross capital spending to be in a range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Moving to our capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to investing smartly in our business, ensuring a strong and efficient investment-grade balance sheet and returning value to shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, we will pay down $2.6 billion of debt. This includes a $976 million prepayment of the first tranche of the payroll support program notes, which we actually paid last week and the payoff of our $1.6 billion convertible notes in cash on May 1. We will also continue to return value to shareholders we have completed $1 billion of the previously authorized $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization.\nAs we announced last month, we intend to complete the remaining $1.5 billion or more than 10% of our current market cap under our share repurchase authorization by the end of July. These decisions highlight our continued confidence in the execution of our plan and driving improved results.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Tom. And before we start Q&A, I'd like to leave you with a few key points. First, we remain committed to an exceptional execution regardless of the macro environment. We had strong execution in the first quarter, initiative implementation, cost discipline in our cost plan, capacity planning and operational excellence. We will take it, and we will move on to do the same in the second quarter.\nSecond, we continue to deliver on our core business initiatives and are seeing positive results from recently launched initiatives, including the optimized loyalty program and amended Chase agreement and the launch of Expedia. Third, we are evolving more than ever, and we're moving quickly. We remain confident that our initiatives, including the additional initiatives announced last month will provide material incremental EBIT in 2025, 2026 and beyond.\nAnd finally, we are resilient and well positioned to manage through a dynamic environment with our cost focus, capacity discipline, underscored by the additional reductions that we just announced our portfolio of Southwest specific initiatives and as Tom just covered our investment grade balance sheet. So we are not slowing down. We will keep evolving to meet the needs of our current and future customers improve our financial performance and create value for our shareholders.\nI'm confident in our plan, confident in our execution and confident in our people. But before I pass it back to Julia to start Q&A, I want to stop and acknowledge and thank her. This is her last earnings call as our Head of Investor Relations. That's a tough job. And Julia, you have done a fantastic job, and we will miss you on these calls, my friend. And with that, back to you.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nThank you, Bob. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. We would like to get to as many of you as possible to be asked that you please limit yourself to 1 question. We will now take the first question."

I'm Gary, and I'll be moderating today's call, which is being recorded. A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] Now Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nThank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by our President and CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; Executive Vice President and Chief Transformation Officer, Ryan Green; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Bob will start off by providing a high-level update on the fourth quarter and full year 2024 performance as well as a strategic update on our Southwest. Even Better plan.\nHe will then turn it over to Andrew to discuss our revenue momentum and our industry-leading operational performance. Ryan will provide a progress update on our portfolio of strategic initiatives, highlighting key milestones achieved. Tammy will follow to walk through cost performance and outlook to also discuss our fleet strategy and cover balance sheet and capital allocation. Bob will wrap this up with a few comments, after which, we will move to Q&A.\nAs a reminder, we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future performance. Our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference non-GAAP results, which exclude special items and are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings press release. Our press release with fourth quarter 2024 results and a supplemental presentation that includes our updated initiative scorecard were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd now I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Julia. And before we jump into our results, I want to take a moment upfront to acknowledge the tragic accident near Reagan DCA airport last night. Our hearts go out to all those loved ones who are among the passengers and the crew. And we also extend our sympathies to our friends at American Airlines and their subsidiary, PSA airlines as they process this event themselves. Finally, I want to thank the first responders who worked tirelessly throughout the night. And while we are all competitors, we are one airline community, and we will do everything that we can to support our friends in American and at PSA. Now turning to the business.\n2024 was a foundational year for us. We further invested in the operation. We finalized our open labor contracts, and we laid out a comprehensive plan our Southwest even better plan. The plan, which is the most transformational in the history of the company, includes initiatives to boost our efficiency and lower costs, including the ability to fly redeye and to turn our aircraft faster. It also significantly improves our customer experience and expands what we offer customers by introducing things like partnerships and an all-new vacations product, all of which enhance the rapid awards in the co-brand ecosystem.\nUltimately, the plan provides a path to financial prosperity, which we believe will open exciting growth opportunities ahead. We are already seeing the benefits of the work we did last year and the plan is well underway. I am very pleased with the momentum we are carrying into 2025 as a result of that effort. Starting with the operation. We saw improvements in nearly every key metric, demonstrating success from our multiyear investments. In fact, we finished the year with an industry-leading completion factor.\nAnd just last week, we were recognized by the Wall Street Journal as 1 of the top 2 U.S. carriers who have \"separated themselves from the pack.\" We finished with a mere 1-point gap to 1st place, a gap that we will work very hard to overcome in 2025. We also finished the year with strong year-over-year unit revenue improvement. Unit revenues for the fourth quarter came in 8% higher than fourth quarter 2023, well above the improved expectations we provided in early December. Nominally, fourth quarter RASM was also 7% higher sequentially relative to third quarter RASM, and that is 5 points ahead of the historical third quarter to fourth quarter trend. The very hard work of our teams helped drive this acceleration as they executed tactical improvements.\nIn addition to improvement from tactical actions, we experienced benefits from a constructive industry backdrop driven by continued demand strength and capacity moderation. We're making great progress with our strategic initiative portfolio, our fleet monetization strategy and our capital allocation plan. The team will walk through the details to provide you with execution proof points and share how we are hitting key milestones. While I see improvement in our pace of execution, the focus on driving speed and agility will continue. And while we are focused on execution, we will keep a pulse on trends and be open-minded as we consider ways to continually improve the business. Moving to our cost performance.\nWe are experiencing above normal unit cost inflation, most notably in market-driven wage rates, airport costs and health care. We outlined a multiyear $500 million cost plan back at Investor Day to help mitigate cost inflation and become more efficient, and we will be relentless in pursuing cost takeout. While we haven't yet shared the cadence of how the $500 million comes online, the focus will be on achieving that rate as quickly as possible. We are committed to the efficiency work, including corporate overhead. The fact is corporate overhead has grown at a faster rate than the rest of the airline as we staffed up for initiatives. We must be the leader in terms of efficiency, and you'll see us being aggressive as you work to become a leaner and more agile organization.\nOur imperative in 2025 is to deliver improved financial results and build further momentum to hit the milestones required to deliver on our 2026 and 2027 Investor Day targets. And we're committed to transparency and routine updates. We debuted a scorecard last quarter, and we updated it again this morning detailing our progress and it's available on our Investor Relations website. For the core business initiatives, we continue to deliver -- to expect to deliver or exceed the $1 billion 2025 EBIT contribution target, which excludes any benefit from fleet transactions. Now moving to the fleet.\nThere's a lot going on at Boeing. I was just there last week visiting with the leadership team and walking the factory floor. They have clearly been hard at work, and I was pleased with the progress that I saw. Everyone was engaged and focused. And while they still have much work to do, they appear to be on a good path and we are feeling more optimistic. Regardless, we think it's prudent to hedge our bets. We are now planning with a conservative 38 delivery assumption for 2025 to derisk the operation. We conservatively adjusted our plans back in March of 2024 and we've not had to republish the schedule since.\nSo we are doing the same thing this year. That's very different from our contractual number, which for 2025 is now 136. We aren't going to get 136 aircraft, but we believe Boeing is on pace to exceed 38 this year and over the next couple of years that there will be an opportunity to do plenty of transactions as Boeing ramps up their production. Tammy is going to go into a lot more detail, but my point is that the opportunity is large. And despite the question of fleet timing, we still aim to deliver the $1.5 billion of targeted total 2025 incremental EBIT from our Investor Day initiative portfolio. We're seeing our tactical actions yield benefits faster than planned and expect to hit all key milestones for our strategic initiatives.\nAs I wrap up, we are in a great position to capitalize on our momentum and continue making progress towards our goals. We have a comprehensive plan, a detailed set of initiatives and constructive industry backdrop, and we are executing with urgency and purpose. We will not let up for even a moment as we move forward and deliver the Southwest even better plan. I want to thank our employees for their dedication and commitment. And for the excellent operation, they've been running despite a way of winter weather. It's just truly exceptional.\nAnd I will now turn it over to Andrew to cover the operations and tactical [indiscernible] performance in more detail. Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob. I want to start by thanking our frontline employees for all their hard work and for helping Southwest have an outstanding year operationally. As Bob mentioned, last week, we were recognized in the Wall Street Journal's 2024 annual airline rankings, moving up to a very close second place this year, taking into consideration 7 key metrics. Among the 9 major U.S. airlines, we were the leader and completion factor with less than 1% of flights canceled during the year. We also had the lowest rate of Tarmac delays and the fewest DOT customer submissions. And we didn't come in below fourth in any category, which is a testament to both our people and investments in the operation. Turning to our revenue performance.\nWe are pleased with how we finished 2024. Our fourth quarter RASM was up 8% year-over-year, which exceeded our prior guidance range of up 5.5% to 7%. In fact, we saw a nice trend in year-over-year RASM growth as we closed out 2024 as we realized tailwinds, both from our internal initiatives and capacity adjustments as well as the benefits of a healthy industry backdrop. While there was noteworthy pressure from supply-demand imbalance in the first half of 2024, we saw a pivot to capacity moderation across the industry with continued healthy demand in the latter part of the year. And as you know, we took deliberate steps to recalibrate and better optimize our revenue management systems and processes. The benefit of that work is materializing faster than expected.\nAs we shared at Investor Day, the revenue management initiative is comprehensive and is supported by a range of capabilities and advancement activities. For example, we reorganized the revenue management team to manage demand for customer itineraries rather than managing demand for individual flights. This change aligns our teams more closely to our system. On the tool side, we invested in improving our ability to predict demand patterns, both by booking window and by flight. We've also launched new proprietary dashboard to help our team to better optimize the revenue performance of our highest demand seats.\nWe are seeing yield benefits from our arm advancement efforts across the board. Those flights with greater than [ 90% ] load factor are seeing the strongest close performance as a result of better management of the booking curve. And our flights with less than [ 90% ] load factor are also seeing sequential improvements as we better optimize fares further out in the booking curve. As we look into 2025, we will keep the same intensity and focus on delivering value from our tactical initiatives while also remaining committed to closely managing capacity.\nWe've made a lot of progress improving yield in the fourth quarter, and our focus now is on maintaining yield performance as we work to close the load factor gap. We expect current demand strength to continue in 2025, and our first quarter RASM is projected to be up in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. As the year progresses, we expect positive year-over-year RASM growth driven by tactical initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect to see benefits from the next phase of our network realignment. This includes reductions to Atlanta and Oakland or previously discussed, with that capacity being redeployed to point of strength like Nashville and Sacramento.\nWe also expect to see record contributions from partnerships, getaways and loyalty initiatives, most notably in the fourth quarter. So while we are pleased with our progress, we are far from satisfied. We have a plan and will be urgent and deliberate in our execution. As I close, I want to thank our people for running a great operation and delivering unparalleled Southwest hospitality.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Ryan to go over the progress of our strategic initiatives.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nSenior VP & CMO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Andrew. As Bob mentioned, I'm going to provide you with updates on our strategic initiatives as we continue to execute against our Southwest even better plan. Earlier this month, we signed our first commercial agreement with Iceland Air, making them our first partner carrier. And starting February 13, we will begin connecting customers and bags crossing the Atlantic on Iceland Air into the Southwest network at our Baltimore station. This is an important milestone in our plan to expand how and where our customers can travel.\nWe will continue to evolve this partnership and plan to also connect Iceland Air into our network in Denver and Nashville later this year, which provides even more connection opportunities through shared gateways. Also, earlier this month, we received our IOS certification for successfully completing the IATA Operational Safety audit. This serves as the industry benchmark in safety auditing, and we are proud of this achievement that reaffirms our commitment to the highest safety standards. It's also an important milestone in our transformation journey as it sets the stage for future growth through additional airline partnerships.\nWe continue to pursue partnership agreements with other global carriers and still plan to announce at least 1 additional partner carrier later this year. Our getaways by Southwest product is also expected to launch later this year, and we are excited to announce today that we will add MGM Resorts International to our list of partners in Las Vegas. This represents a large milestone from 1 of our focused markets for getaways by Southwest. And along with our existing partners there, this will give us access to a substantial portion of the hotel inventory in Las Vegas with more partners to come.\nWe continue to make progress and move forward on our assigned and premium seating product and continue to expect to meet the financial targets and time lines we communicated at Investor Day to begin selling seat assignments in the second half of this year and operate flights was signed in premium seating in the first half of next year. As we finalize our cabin layout and work towards FAA certification, we plan to begin retrofitting aircraft midyear, starting with our larger [ dash ] 800 aircraft with the smaller 700s to follow later in the year.\nBy beginning retrofits midyear, it allows us to meet our planned operate date. It minimizes the amount of time we have a mixed fleet, and it keeps the 700 aircraft flying with their current seat count for more of this year. We believe our tech ops facilities, employees and vendors are well equipped to update our entire fleet within our time line. Technology development is also going well. Our technology employees and vendors are hard at work, coding the necessary technological changes and will soon begin a rigorous testing phase before we begin selling assigned seats.\nAnother key milestone reached just this month is our amended co-brand agreement with Chase. As we've discussed before, we needed to update our agreement to provide our card members with new benefits related to our assigned and premium seating products. We'll have more information to share on the details of those benefits soon, but we're excited to get these new card products into the market as we're confident customers will value these benefits, and they will drive co-brand card acquisitions in the future. This agreement supports the multiyear financial targets we announced at Investor Day.\nWithin the operation, we continue to focus on efficiency and modernization by reducing the time it takes to turn an aircraft and increasing our aircraft productivity. We've made meaningful progress toward our goal of removing paper-based processes from the day-to-day operation and have digitized crew paperwork. Our November 2024 schedule was the first that implemented a 5-minute reduction in turn times in 12 of our stations. And I'm happy to report that it's working as planned with no operational impact.\nLater this quarter, we plan to introduce a digital communication tool that will allow pilots, flight attendants and operations agents to chat live with each other while they're working the turn -- while they're working to turn the aircraft between flights further enhancing our efficiency. We continue to expect our turn time initiative to create the equivalent of roughly 16 free aircraft by the end of November this year. While we are already a leader in turn time, we are confident this will further our competitive advantage in the day-to-day operation.\nIn addition to reducing turn time, we will also launch redeye flying in 5 key markets next month. with the first flights arriving on Valentine's Day. This will ramp up to a total of 33 redeye markets in the June 2025 based schedule, including Hawaii routes. And we're pleased with how redeye flights are booking to date with nearly 75% of passengers on a connecting itinerary either before or after the redeye flight. Redeye flights capitalize on peak seasonality and maximize network connectivity while generating incremental load factor. And remember that our turn and redeye initiatives aid our modest capacity growth plans for this year of up 1% to 2% year-over-year.\nAnd finally, I am pleased to share that our service modernization efforts to drive operational efficiencies and improved experience for employees and customers are also paying off. As a result of the digital capabilities we provided our customers to enable them to self-serve, we've seen call volumes decrease even further than what was assumed in our plans. These digital enhancements have enabled a significant increase in efficiency within our call center. As you can see, we are working hard and making continued progress on our transformational plan. We are committed to continued execution and delivering on our Southwest even better plan. And I want to thank the hard work of our incredible people who are making this happen.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I am pleased by the level of execution Ryan just covered and the realization of early benefits from our Southwest. Even Better plan. As we laid out, our plan provides a road map to transform Southwest and importantly, to restore our financial prosperity and drive sustainable shareholder value. While we have more our work ahead, to hit our multiyear financial targets, our fourth quarter performance exceeded expectations, and we ended the year with improved year-over-year margins in the fourth quarter. Much of this improvement has already been covered, so I'll pick up with color on our cost performance, and we'll close with a few comments on the balance sheet and an update on capital allocation, including more insights on our fleet monetization strategy.\nOur fourth quarter 2024 CASM-X increased 11.1% year-over-year and full year 2024 CASM-X increased 7.8% year-over-year, both inclusive of a $92 million gain from a sale-leaseback transaction in fourth quarter 2024. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of elevated operating expenses associated with inflationary pressures including contractual market-driven wage rate increases. And fourth quarter specifically, the decline in capacity growth resulted in additional unit cost pressure. We are urgently working towards implementing the $500 million cost initiative announced at Investor Day in September with an intense focus on exceeding that number and accelerating as much of the benefit into this year as possible.\nOur efforts are focused on mitigating cost inflation by minimizing hiring, optimizing scheduling efficiency, capitalizing on supply chain opportunities and aggressively improving corporate overhead. Looking forward, we currently expect this quarter's CASM-X to increase in the range of 7% to 9% year-over-year driven primarily by the continuation of general inflationary pressures from wage and work rule headwinds from labor contracts ratified last year and also from continued capacity moderation efforts.\nAs 2025 progresses, our year-over-year unit cost inflation is expected to ease as we lap labor contract anniversaries, deploy initiative-driven capacity growth and aggressively pursue benefits from our cost initiatives. Our cabin retrofit efforts associated with our premium seating initiatives are expected to result in approximately $150 million in incremental costs primarily in the second half of the year. But these will be onetime and will not carry forward into 2026. Taking all these variables into account excluding potential gains from any future sale fleet sales, sale leaseback transactions, we expect to exit 2025 with fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X growth in the low single digits. Moving to fleet.\nAs we highlighted in third quarter earnings, we saw the prudent planning of our conservative fleet delivery expectations pay off. As a reminder, we entered 2024 expecting to receive 79 Boeing aircraft deliveries. In March, Boeing informed us, we would receive 46. After going through a detailed process, we conservatively adjusted our plan to 20 deliveries to reduce the risk of further operational impact. We closed out 2024 with a total of 22 deliveries essentially in line with our internal estimation.\nNow in terms of how we are thinking about managing our fleet this year, we have a modest capacity plan of 1% to 2% year-over-year growth and that growth is fully funded by our efficiency initiatives. This sets us up to reduce our total aircraft count by year-end. However, we still want as many deliveries as possible to modernize our fleet and reach our goal of an all [ -7, - 8, ] fleet in 2031. To that end, we are planning to retire 51 aircraft this year. And in addition, we are contemplating the sale of an additional [ 10-800NG ]. To support this, we need 38 deliveries from Boeing. However, as Bob shared, all incremental deliveries beyond 38 offer an opportunity to accelerate the execution of our fleet monetization strategy. I will remind you that we view our fleet monetization strategy as incremental to the base business improvement. The strategy is highly idiosyncratic opportunity to monetize our fleet through our portfolio of sales and sale leasebacks to fund fleet modernization and support shareholder return.\nThe fleet opportunity is uniquely available to Southwest as a result of the following factors: one, the current industry aircraft supply constraints, which are driven by OEM challenges creating strong demand in the secondary market; two, the embedded value in our [ -8 ] from Boeing compensation and favorable pricing, which creates a meaningful value gap relative to the strong secondary market. and three, access to aircraft provided by our contractual order book, which is beyond the needs of our modest capacity plan. As a reminder, the 1% to 2% growth over the next 3 years does not require additional aircraft as it is funded by efficiency initiatives. Now, of course, the -800 and -8 aircraft play different roles in our fleet strategy initiative. I'll start with the -800.\nThese are mid-life aircraft that currently have highly favorable market valuation. The current market setup and our order book economics combined to create an opportunity to replace these midlife -800s with new -8. This creates value for Southwest as we plan to realize the lower maintenance and fuel costs, enhance customer experience and better reliability associated with -8 aircraft, all with reduced capital spending. With the -8 aircraft, the opportunity to realize value comes from the ability to sell excess aircraft in our order book and pull forward the significant embedded value that comes from favorable pricing and the current market value.\nHowever, to be able to fully execute the strategy, we must receive sufficient deliveries from Boeing. While we are feeling very good about where Boeing is headed, we will want to gain confidence in their production capabilities before we move forward with sales. So you can understand that our strong preference is to execute sales, the -800 sales facilitate capital-efficient fleet modernization and for the , the opportunity is to harvest the significant embedded value. We will, however, be opportunistic with sale-leasebacks and pursue them as a mechanism for an orderly exit of the -800s from our fleet.\nNow that we have completed our first transaction, you have a better idea of the economics of the -800 sale leaseback. A lock in the certainty of today's strong secondary pricing, while simultaneously bridging our operations until we are confident that we will receive our contractual replacement -7s and -8 from Boeing. Essentially, these sale leasebacks are functioning as forward sales. And again, we will pursue them opportunistically only where it makes financial sense while also taking into account overall fleet modernization goals, financing needs and capital allocation considerations. Moving to CapEx.\nFull year 2024 gross capital expenditures were $2.1 billion, in line with previous guidance, including proceeds of $871 million from the sale leaseback transaction in fourth quarter 2024, full year 2024 net capital expenditures were $1.2 billion. We currently expect 2025 gross capital spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This includes approximately $1.2 billion in aircraft capital spending and $1.6 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. And again, there is an opportunity to lower net capital spending from our fleet monetization strategy.\nAs we look to the future, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and are proud to have an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. We also remain committed to providing significant returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2024, we returned $680 million, consisting of $430 million in dividends and $250 million of share repurchases to our shareholders. The $250 million ASR was the first repurchase program of the $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization announced at our September Investor Day. The company continues to plan for the launch of an additional $750 million ASR program later this quarter. Assuming performance trends continue as expected, we plan to complete repurchases of the remaining $1.5 billion available under our share repurchase authorization in 2025. Before I hand it back to Bob, I want to send out [ LUV love ] to my Southwest family and to all of you in the investment community for your support in comradery over the past 33-plus years.\nWith that, I will turn it back to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. As we wrap up, I want to emphasize a few points. First, the team is intensely focused on meeting and exceeding our targeted performance improvement trajectory. Second, our core business initiatives are performing ahead of expectations outlined only 4 months ago, and we expect to deliver or exceed the $1 billion 2025 EBIT contribution target. This excludes the benefit from any fleet transactions. Nonetheless, our goal remains to deliver $1.5 billion of targeted total 2025 incremental EBIT. Third, we are taking a hard look at our cost structure. Our cost performance including in the first quarter is not where we want it to be. We are taking immediate actions to accelerate as much of the $500 million of targeted cost savings into 2025 as possible and we will report on our progress as we go.\nFinally, we have tremendous confidence in the plan and are excited about the future of Southwest. We plan to repurchase $2.25 billion of stock this year or approximately 12% and of our market cap at current prices. We expect this to be very accretive for our investors as we work to deliver our Southwest even better plan, including our North Star Gold to achieve after-tax ROIC of at least [ 15% ] in 2027. The pace of those share repurchases do not depend on the progress of our fleet monetization strategy.\nNow before I turn it to Q&A, I want to say a few words about Tammy. As you all know, Tammy will be retiring as our CFO at the end of this quarter after 33 years with the company. She has served in many roles and has the distinction of serving as our first Head of Investor Relations. She's been our Chief Financial Officer since 2012. Over the years, she's led us through times of great prosperity that provided for lucrative shareholder returns. She's an innovative leader, who is instrumental in the success of countless endeavors. She leaves Southwest with a fortress balance sheet, investment grade rated by all 3 credit agencies and Tammy is a humble generous and inspirational leader. She's a tireless mentor and as such, leaves a strong legacy and you won't find a nicer, kinder and tougher person anywhere. So I'd like to thank Tammy for her deep commitment to our employees, the investment community and our shareholders. And Tammy, congrats on all you have accomplished thank you for your leadership and more importantly, your friendship. You will be missed.\nAnd on that note, I will pass it back to Julia to start our Q&A.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bob, and congratulations Tammy. We LUV you too. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question."

I'm Gary, and I'll be moderating today's call, which is being recorded. A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]\nNow Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you so much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer; Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo.\nBob will get us started with an overview of the company's performance and strategy and will also provide color on the strategic initiatives announced this morning. Andrew will provide an update on the revenue and Tammy will cover our costs and balance sheet. Brian Green, EVP of Commercial Transformation is also in the room with us today as well as other executives to support Q&A.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results on our earnings press release. Our press release with second quarter 2024 results and a separate press release announcing select strategic initiatives were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We have a lot to cover today, so let's jump right in. In my comments today, I will touch briefly on our results for the quarter and then provide detail on the plans we announced earlier this morning to implement meaningful changes to our business and better position Southwest Airlines to produce higher returns in a more competitive, higher cost environment.\nAs Julie mentioned, Andrew will provide details on our revenue performance, including the work underway to calibrate our revenue management system and processes, and Tammy will discuss our cost, CapEx and balance sheet.\nStarting with our overall results, they are not where we need them to be, and they are not reflective of what we are capable of delivering. We will cover where we fell short as well as our action plan in detail later on the call, but I'll hit on a few highlights first.\nOur frontline employees executed very well as we continue to improve in nearly every operating and customer metric. Once again, we ran a high-quality operation with a completion factor of 99.5% despite challenging weather. This was further evidenced by our performance following Hurricane Beryl earlier this month. We experienced an 8% cancel rate on July 8 as the store moved through the Houston area but had only a 0.3% cancel rate the following day as we recovered quickly with almost no operational hangover from the prior day. I am very proud of our team. And following the global technology outages, we were able to recover very quickly and experienced a near 0 cancel rate.\nInvestments made to advance core operations and modernize technology meant that we had redundancy in place for key systems that we're experiencing issues. Time and time again, the purposeful investments we've made to improve our resilience and ability to recover from disruptions are demonstrating their value and that investment will continue.\nOur exceptional customer service continues to improve as well and was recently recognized by J.D. Power, where we were awarded the leading Economy Class Customer Satisfaction distinction for the third consecutive year. Reliable operational performance and customer service are and always will be cornerstones of our business model.\nMoving on to revenue performance. Unit revenue for the quarter declined 3.8% year-over-year primarily as a result of domestic capacity outpacing demand. The decline was also a result of Southwest specific challenges as we fully mature our usage of a new O&D based revenue management system. Andrew will go into more detail later, but bottom line, we sold too many seats for the peak summer travel period too early in the booking curve. It's not unusual to have growing pains with these types of systems.\nWe are working quickly to action opportunities to drive performance improvement. We're also adding additional leadership expertise and support, including our plan to hire a Chief Revenue Officer to focus on revenue management and pricing. We continue to have confidence that the new revenue management system will be a driver of long-term revenue improvement.\nThe management team and I, with the support of our Board, are completely aligned on the imperative to produce results and ultimately deliver returns ahead of our cost of capital. Doing so requires an evaluation of all opportunities and a willingness to evolve some long-standing selfless policies while staying true to our values.\nWith that in mind, I'll discuss some of the changes we are making to further evolve Southwest Airlines. These are part of an ongoing strategic transformation of the business, and we will share more details during our Investor Day, where we will outline a comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline.\nAs I shared back in April, our teams have been hard at work evaluating fundamental changes to our seating, cabin and boarding procedures. It's clear that the open seating model that served us well for so many years is no longer optimal for today's customer. I want to stress that this decision was not made lightly. We have been very thorough and deliberate in how we approach the question, conducting multiple sophisticated research studies over many months that evaluated customer preference and looked at different types of cabin layouts and seating methods.\nOur research shows that 80% of our customers prefer an assigned seat, and 86% of our potential customers prefer an assigned seat. Further, when a customer defects from Southwest to one of our competitors, our open seating policy is cited as the #1 reason why. The answer is clear, there is more demand for Southwest Airlines with an assigned seating model, and there is a significant ability to monetize the cabin more effectively with a premium seating option.\nBy extension, these changes are expected to drive significant value for our shareholders. We feel confident that the solution we are implementing will retain the positive elements of the Southwest Airlines experience and enable us to evolve in a manner that's consistent with what today's air traveler is seeking.\nWhile specific cabin layouts are still being finalized, we expect roughly 1/3 of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom. We're also designing a boarding process that retains the organized com our customers enjoy today, but also complements an assigned seating model. We've been studying this in depth to preserve our operational efficiency and how quickly we turn an aircraft.\nWe've conducted both live boarding tests to understand passenger movement in a real world environment and also more than 8 million digital simulations to test different boarding options. These digital boarding simulations include data from real flights with real passenger manifest to understand differences in boarding times stemming from passenger mix, things like families traveling together, customers who may need more time to board experienced versus inexperienced travelers and more. The data clearly indicates that any operational impacts are neutral or an enhancement to current performance.\nWe're also approaching this change in a capital-efficient manner. New aircraft will be delivered with our improved RECARO seats beginning early next year. For existing aircraft where we must retrofit to a new configuration, we plan to use existing seats within our fleet to avoid a large capital expenditure. We're working quickly to realize the value of this new model as soon as possible.\nNew seat configurations require FAA certification, which typically takes several months and only then can we begin the process of retrofitting the fleet. We, therefore, expect to make bookings available beginning next year. The aircraft downtime should be minimal to complete the cabin changes, but keep in mind that we have a fleet of roughly 800 aircraft to retrofit and that will take time.\nChanging from an open seating model to an assigned seating model will be a complex and transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company and is one of several commercial initiatives currently underway to be detailed at our Investor Day.\nGiven the significance of the changes I've asked our Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, to take on leadership of this initiative on a full-time basis. As EVP of Commercial Transformation, Ryan will lead this effort along with other commercial initiatives already underway. Ryan has led the work to this point and is steeped in knowledge regarding customer trends and previously and successfully led efforts to transform our Rapid Rewards loyalty program and the digital customer experience, and Ryan will report directly to me.\nAdditionally, today, we are publishing schedule that incorporate red-eye flying, which will phase in rapidly by summer 2025 and combined with ongoing reductions in turn time through new technologies and procedures will enable us to fund nearly all new capacity the next 3 years through initiatives rather than additional aircraft CapEx.\nThese initiatives are part of a comprehensive strategic transformation and reflect a commitment and my personal commitment to deliver an implementing plan aimed at driving shareholder value and achieving ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. We will provide more details around the timing and value of these initiatives and other tactical and strategic initiatives when we gather for Investor Day in late September, but we wanted to keep you up to speed on some of the decisions that we've made already and the deliberate plans we have in place to implement them.\nAnd before I close, I want to again recognize all the efforts from our incredible employees. Thank you all for the excellence and the dedication that you bring to work every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew to provide a full update on our revenue performance and outlook.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob. I'm very excited about the strategic initiatives we have coming. I am also very proud of our people for their continued focus on safety, running a quality operation with the lowest year-to-date cancellation rate in the industry, and our strong customer service performance trends. Moving to revenue performance. We have experienced challenges in managing demand across booking curves as we deployed efforts to address load factor underperformance. As a result, we experienced yields and ultimately, revenue dilution from selling too many seats too early in the booking curve.\nAs you will likely recall, back in the spring of 2023, we transitioned to a new and modernized revenue management system. The system is fundamentally different from and superior to our prior system. The new system manages revenue on an origin of destination basis compared with our prior leg-based system. The decision to implement this new system followed an extensive review of our options, including a comprehensive 18-month long pilot to evaluate and test 2 new revenue management systems against our prior system.\nWhat we directly observed during the testing period was the system we selected consistently produced superior results. The goal is to maximize the revenue performance of our flights, especially our best flights. And the new system accomplishes just that by considering what customers are willing to pay at different phases of the booking curve, including taking note of the differentiation between business and leisure customers.\nHowever, adapting to a new system is not straightforward. Add to that, changing schedules from Boeing delivery shifts and what we got was a complicated rollout. Regardless, while we estimate about 2 points of year-over-year headwind to the third quarter from bookings already in place, we were taking decisive actions to recalibrate the system. The estimated impact is already built in to our 3Q RASM outlook of flat to down 2% on a year-over-year basis.\nThe outside experts, that Bob mentioned, are supporting our employees and getting the most as the capabilities of this new system. The good news is that we have confidence in the superiority of the new system as evidenced by the month-long AB testing that we conducted. As we gain expertise in optimizing system, we expect to see a noticeable tailwind to performance, likely starting in September of this year. Adopting a new revenue management system is a once-in-a-generation implementation, and we are committed to executing a successful turnaround in our revenue performance.\nIn addition to the improvement we expect to see in our revenue management performance, our plan includes continued network optimization and capacity moderation moving to the back half of the year. Our summer, fall and recently published winter-based schedules all include actions to target supply to demand across geographies and calendar periods as well as scheduled quality actions to facilitate demand capture.\nBy the fourth quarter, we expect less capacity oversupply as well as improvements in our revenue management. We are planning for our capacity to decline 4% year-over-year in fourth quarter, with seats and trips down roughly 8% and therefore, we expect RASM growth to be positive year-over-year by fourth quarter. We will deliberately and urgently pursue tactical opportunities to improve financial performance, including calibrating our revenue management process, continuing our work to optimize our network.\nFurther, we also have a plan to capitalize on transformational opportunities to generate incremental revenue, some of which Bob shared with you.\nBefore I close, I want to thank our people again for doing such an amazing job driving operational excellence and providing our legendary hospitality, I am so appreciative of their contributions.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, I will provide an update on our cost performance before turning to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our second quarter CASM-X increased 6% year-over-year and we continue to expect CASM-X for full year 2024 to increase in the range of 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. The higher year-over-year CASM-X growth in the second half of this year is driven primarily by a continuation of market-driven labor cost pressure from our new contracts as well as from the moderation of year-over-year capacity growth. We are urgently and deliberately pursuing opportunities to mitigate cost pressures including the drag from overstaffing related to previously reported Boeing delivery delays.\nAs discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we have expanded our voluntary leave and time off programs to further reduce labor expenses and bring staffing levels in line with our current fleet. We have halted all the critical hiring, and we continue to expect to end this year with head count down roughly 2,000 from year-end 2023. And we continue to plan for head count to be down again in 2025 as attrition levels exceed our controlled hiring levels.\nOur second quarter average fuel price of $2.76 per gallon was in line with our expectations. Our hedge portfolio continues to provide protection against spikes in prices and we are continuing to opportunistically add protection with no change to our target of a roughly 50% hedge position.\nTurning to our fleet. We prudently adjusted our 2024 delivery expectations prior to our April earnings report to mitigate Boeing delivery risk to our internal planning functions. We, therefore, continue to plan for 20 -8 aircraft deliveries, 31 -700 retirements and 4 -800 lease returns for the year. We remain committed to our fleet modernization benefit and our planned reduction in aircraft exceeds our planned delivery.\nWe also remain committed to longer-term capacity discipline and ROIC production. We expect third quarter capacity to increase approximately 2% and fourth quarter capacity to decrease approximately 4%. Accordingly, our expectation for full year 2024 capacity continues to be up approximately 4% year-over-year.\nLooking beyond 2024, we remain committed to earning our right to grow and plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach our long-term financial goal of returns on invested capital consistently in excess of our cost of capital.\nOur expected capital spending for 2024 is approximately $2.5 billion, which is in line with our prior guidance and well below our expectations of $3.5 billion to $4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are in ongoing discussions with Boeing regarding the financial impact of delivery delays and as with past compensation, we expect any financial damages to be realized as a reduction in the cost basis of certain aircraft.\nOur balance sheet is obviously a critical competitive strength with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. We continue to be in a net cash position as we ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $10 billion versus $8 billion of outstanding debt. We expect a modest $29 million in scheduled debt repayments for the full year, and currently, 2024 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2024 interest expense.\nFollowing the pandemic, we have maintained elevated liquidity levels primarily to fund fleet modernization efforts, labor contract ratification bonuses, debt service considerations and to provide insurance against unforeseen business risk. With much of the uncertainty largely behind us, we intend to start normalizing our liquidity levels back towards pre-COVID levels targeting minimum total liquidity, including our undrawn revolver.\nOur long-term financial goals remain unchanged: maintain a strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit ratings and ample liquidity, grow earnings, margins and capital returns. As Andrew said, we intend to pay off 2025 debt maturities at least partially in cash and specifically plan to repay or refinance the first tranche of the payroll support program loans as the associated interest rates start to ratchet higher for the industry beginning next year.\nWe also remain committed to our legacy of healthy shareholder returns. We are proud of our history of returning capital to our shareholders. We returned more than $13.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010, and we returned $215 million to shareholders through dividends in the first half of this year. We paid another dividend just a couple of weeks ago here in third quarter. We are actively reviewing our return of capital policies, and ultimately, our goal is to restore shareholder returns to historic levels.\nAs I close, I want to reiterate that our financial performance is not reflective of what we can and must deliver. As shareholders, you expect us to lead the industry in financial performance and we will be satisfied with nothing less. There are areas we need to improve, which we are owning and addressing as a management team. Despite these distractions, our employees remain steadfast in their dedication to the mission of the company and to providing our storied and world-class hospitality to our valued customers.\nI am both proud and grateful for our employees. I am excited about the plans we have in place to secure a bright future for Southwest and to share more about our tactical and strategic initiatives as well as our capital allocation plan at Investor Day in September. We remain fully committed to executing on a plan to restore returns on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital, as this remains our guiding financial principles.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to you, Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Tammy. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analysts' questions. We would like to get as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, if necessary. We will now take the first question."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Well, let me state right up front that I am disappointed with our first quarter performance. There are a lot of factors that I'll go into, and there's a lot to cover, including the latest Boeing challenges. More importantly, there are significant efforts and progress underway as we cannot, and we won't be satisfied until we are delivering the kind of returns you expect from Southwest Airlines. So before I go any further, I just want to sincerely thank our people for their extraordinary efforts as we work quickly to drive improvement.\nTurning to our performance. We achieved records for first quarter operating revenues and passengers continuing our streak of 8 straight quarters of record top line performance. We saw a nice acceleration in managed business revenues up 25% nominally year-over-year. We also continued our streak of solid operational performance. For a while now, we have been consistently running a great completion factor averaging right around 99%, and we continue to improve in nearly all operational and customer metrics. I'm also proud of the progress we made on our open labor agreements. It's been a long road, and I want to recognize everyone involved for continuing to work through to the finish line to reward our amazing employees for their contributions.\nRyan will go into our revenue performance in more detail in a moment. And while our revenue trends were solid in the first quarter and are expected to be solid year again in the second quarter, we need to increase revenue production to offset cost inflation. The biggest opportunity to improve performance and profitability and urgency is continued focus on network optimization and capacity.\nWe opened 18 new cities during the pandemic and worked hard in 2023 to restore our network and fly our full fleet on the heels of the demand surge in 2022, while that boosted aircraft utilization, it added significant capacity. And when combined with 2023 business travel coming in below projections has resulted in a significant number of new markets under development and a material number of markets that are not performing at the level required in this higher cost environment.\nNetwork adjustments planned last fall are in place as of the March schedule, and they are proving to be largely on track. Those optimization efforts were primarily aimed to adjust for changing demand trends, including lower capacity on Tuesday and Wednesday, a reduction in short-haul business markets and a material reduction in flights during shoulder periods of the day.\nThe changes are beneficial and they contributed to us exiting the first quarter with healthy margins for the month of March, more as needed and we are continuing efforts to optimize the network and reduce the number of markets in development that aren't performing to more historic levels. Along those lines, we have made the difficult decision to eliminate service in 4 cities. Syracuse, New York, Houston [indiscernible] Intercontinental, Cozumel and Bellingham, Washington. That is never an easy decision. We form bonds with the airports and the communities that we serve. These are wonderful communities, and we are very grateful for their support over the past several years.\nIn addition, we are also restructuring several other stations. Most notably, we are reducing flights in Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare. While it's never our desire to exit a city or shrink service to a market, we are committed to our financial performance goals and network and capacity actions will continue as a lever to improve overall financial performance.\nIn addition to network optimization, we have a number of other efforts underway to increase revenue productivity. First, tuning our new revenue management system by better anticipating and optimizing demand and fares along the booking curve and unlocking additional capabilities that will further boost the contribution from the system.\nSecond, focusing on increasing passenger volume including adding new attributes to our value proposition. We are working to ensure our current and future customers understand our terrific value proposition. That includes a significant new brand campaign which started last week, highlighting our signature customer-friendly policies.\nSeparately, we are considering more transformational options and follow-on initiatives. That includes work previously underway to study customer preference around seating and our cabin. It's been several years since we last studied this in-depth and customer preferences and expectations change over time. We are also studying the operational and financial benefits of any potential change. We remain committed to our industry best customer-friendly policies but we are also committed to understanding and meeting customer expectations.\nWe have transformed before adding things like WiFi, larger bins and in-seat power, and we will continue to adapt as needed. It is too early to share the specifics of what we are exploring, but I want to be transparent and let you know that work is well underway.\nOf course, the biggest change we have experienced is the news from Boeing on deliveries. The Boeing issues are a significant impact, and we are taking quick action to replan based on expected 2024 and 2025 delivery delays. As I've said before, while it's impactful, I support Boeing taking the time to do the work to understand and fix the issues, a stronger Boeing company for the long term is good for Southwest Airlines. I visit Boeing in late March, and while there is much work to do, I am encouraged by the comprehensive approach that their leadership is taking. I will be back at Boeing this summer when they complete their plan, and I will be visiting Spirit Aerosystems as well.\nI won't downplay the challenges from the Boeing issues. They are a big deal and contribute to changing capacity set. They're redoing schedules and forecasting now in accurate staffing levels. All of that is costly. It pulls people away from their regular work and it creates a significant financial drag. That said, it won't deter from our work to improve our results. We will continue to control what we can control and work our plan as they take the time to become a better Boeing company.\nBoeing issues aside, we already had aggressive plans in place to further optimize the network to improve profitability, moderate CapEx and capacity to improve free cash flow and ROIC and drive staffing and operational actions to improve efficiency. All of that work is now being accelerated.\nAs we continue our focus on capital efficiency, free cash flow generation and aggressively restoring our returns, we will continue to moderate both capacity and CapEx until we do so. Managing our CapEx is obviously key to improving free cash flow, which, along with ROIC, we are laser-focused on. Our bias will remain to retire aircraft as planned and any capacity growth that we have in the near term will come entirely from gauge and initiatives to drive aircraft utilization, including tightening turn time through process innovation and automation, and introducing a modest level of red-eye flying. Both of those initiatives boost aircraft utilization and create capacity without aircraft CapEx.\nThe initiative to reduce turn time is going well and is a first step. 12 stations will see a 5-minute reduction in turn time in the November 2024 schedule with further reductions in early 2025. We will share details on the full plan, which includes these and other planned strategic initiatives at our Investor Day, now planned for September 26 when I look forward to welcoming everyone here to Dallas.\nOn our cost control efforts, note that we already had plans in place to end 2024 with head count flat to down through efficiency efforts like deploying automation, and Gen AI solutions for greater productivity and some customer support functions and driving organizational efficiency by combining like functions.\nFurther capacity reductions in 2024 and 2025 create additional head count and efficiency challenges, and we are moving quickly to address those through a combination of voluntary programs. We have essentially frozen and stopped all hiring except for a limited number of critical positions and now expect to end 2024 with headcount down approximately 2,000 as compared to the end of 2023 and Head count will be down again in 2025 through continued efficiency efforts. We are already seeing the benefits of time off without pay program that in fact, the participation in these programs generated higher-than-expected savings in March which was one of the factors that contributed to us beating our first quarter CASM-X guidance.\nLast quarter, we laid out a plan that included providing a line of sight to cover our cost of capital in 2024. We are admittedly materially off that plan. Much of this comes from external factors, including headwinds from increased market prices for fuel and impacts attributable to the most recent delays in Boeing deliveries but we aren't accepting that as our fate and are taking swift action against what we can control. So there's a lot going on right now, and we have a good grip and plan around areas of the business where we can improve.\nAs a recap, we are continued to be guided by our goals to drive ROIC performance by making additional network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets and adjusting capacity, enhancing revenue performance in the intermediate term through marketing and revenue management efforts, offsetting cost pressures with efficiency initiatives and programs to reduce headcount and lower discretionary spending. Curbing our capacity plans and managing down CapEx and investing in initiatives that create capacity without capital investment.\nAnd finally, by creating a new set of strategic initiatives to share with you at our Investor Day this September. We will not tolerate underperformance of any kind, and everyone is committed to doing what it takes. I am truly blessed to lead the company with such passionate and dedicated employees, and I am confident that we can and will adjust as needed as we have in the past and work to hit our financial targets, which are not negotiable. So before I close, I just want to say thank you again to our employees for all that they do every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy for a more in-depth review of our financial performance and outlook.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob just covered, this year is not shaping up as we had initially planned. We have never and will never accept underperformance. There are a lot of things that contributed to our current position, the impact of continued delivery delays from Boeing, significant market-driven inflationary pressure from new labor contracts, volatile fuel prices and dynamic customer travel patterns. Those are all very real reasons, but we will not use them as excuses. Instead, our focus is to control what we can control, to take aggressive actions to adapt as required and to produce financial returns period.\nBob mentioned the warrior spirit of our employees. It's a very real thing, and it will be the key to our turnaround. So before I dive in, I want to thank our incredible employees for their resilience, their perseverance and their dedication as we gear up to tackle the challenge we have before us. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance in detail. So I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet.\nOverall, our unit cost, excluding special items, increased modestly, less than 1% year-over-year in first quarter. Our first quarter average fuel price of $2.92 per gallon came in a bit below our guidance range. Market prices have been volatile. And based on the April 18 market, we increased our full year fuel price guidance by roughly $0.15 to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon and we're anticipating our second quarter fuel price to fall within that range as well.\nWe are currently 55% hedged here in the second quarter and 58% hedged for the full year. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, now 26% hedged and are currently 47% hedged in 2025. Our treasury team continues to do a great job managing our program as we see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with the continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection in each calendar year.\nThe purpose of our hedge is to provide protection from spikes when we need it most. Over the past 2 years, we have benefited significantly from our hedge portfolio, generating net settlement gains of $872 million and $145 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. For 2024, we are currently expecting only a very modest loss, but as Brent gets above $90 a barrel, our position would begin to materially kick in that obviously is helpful insurance to have in this volatile environment.\nMoving to nonfuel cost. Our first quarter unit cost, excluding special items, were up 5% year-over-year in first quarter. Of course, that was primarily driven by pressure from new labor agreement and an increase in planned maintenance associated with the -800s coming off their engine [ honeymoon ]. This was a point ahead of our previous expectations, primarily from favorable airport settlements, but also from some early benefits from our cost control initiatives like voluntary time off programs. I am very thankful to all the employees who are pitching in to help reduce costs. It's always been part of our culture and the contributions that our people are making across the company are a sign that our culture is alive and well.\nThroughout first quarter, we were reacting and adjusting to continuous information from Boeing on further aircraft delivery delays, causing some additional movement within our CASM-X guidance expectations as we quickly worked to revise our 2024 plans.\nWhile Boeing's challenges continue to significantly impact us, I am immensely proud of the way our team continues to handle such a dynamic situation, running multiple forecasting scenarios for critical decision support, including support in adjusting capacity and reoptimizing the network.\nLooking to second quarter and full year 2024, we continue to expect similar cost pressures throughout the year, driven primarily by elevated labor costs and maintenance expenses. We currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year and our full year CASM-X to increase in the range of 7% to 8% year-over-year, elevated from our previous full year CASM-X guidance due to lower capacity plans in the second half of the year.\nThe estimated sequential change in nominal CASM-X from first to second quarter is largely in line with historical norms when adjusted for capacity levels. roughly 5 points of our full year CASM-X guidance is attributable to elevated salaries, wages and benefits expense and roughly 1 point is due to elevated maintenance and materials expense. While we continue to expect pressure from maintenance costs this year, we have reworked our maintenance plans given our new delivery expectations and we now expect lower full year 2024 maintenance expense compared with our previous expectations.\nWe are also planning more voluntary leave and time off programs to further reduce labor expenses and address current overstaffing. Despite these added pressures, which are a direct result of the Boeing aircraft delivery delays, we are aggressively working to control costs, reduced inflationary pressures and cut discretionary spending across all cost categories.\nI want to reiterate, we are far from satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we return to financial prosperity with our North Star being ROIC well exceeding our cost of capital. We will go into a lot more detail on our plans at Investor Day in September of this year.\nNow turning to our fleet. We have reacted quickly over the quarter to the updated Boeing delivery delays. We began the quarter with the expectation we received 79 of our 85 contractual deliveries in 2024. That number dropped to an expected 46-8 aircraft at the timing of our March 8-K and has since reduced even further to a conservatively planned 20-8 aircraft deliveries. Thus far, we have received 5-8 aircraft from Boeing during the first quarter and have retired 3-700 aircraft from our fleet. To reduce distractions and impacts to the business and hedge against further potential delivery delays, we will now plan to hold on to an additional 14-700 aircraft that were originally planned to retire this year, bringing our expected 2024 total retirements found to 35 aircraft, including 4-800 lease returns compared with our previous expectation 49 aircraft retirements. While we remain committed to our fleet modernization, we feel it is prudent to retain some flexibility until we have better certainty around our aircraft deliveries and around the certification of the MAX-7.\nThe updated Boeing delivery expectations has also impacted our capital expenditures and cash flow expectations for the year. As a result of these 20 expected aircraft deliveries, we currently expect our capital spending to be approximately $2.5 billion, well below our previous guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Keep in mind, our 2024 CapEx guidance includes an estimate for progress payments based on our current contractual order book and CapEx estimates will be fluid until we finish working our plans and aligning on updated expectations for actual 2025 deliveries which we plan to share at our Investor Day this fall.\nA quick note on our capacity plans. The Boeing delivery delays did not impact our first quarter capacity finishing up 11% year-over-year on solid completion factor. Looking ahead, as we rework our capacity plans for the year, we now expect second quarter capacity to be up in the range of 8% to 9% year-over-year. The majority of the Boeing capacity cuts will occur over the second half of the year with third quarter capacity expected to increase in the low single digits and fourth quarter capacity expected to decrease in the low to mid-single digits, placing our full year 2024 capacity up approximately 4% all year-over-year.\nLooking beyond 2024, we plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach our long-term financial goals to consistently achieve ROIC well above our cost of capital. As a reminder, our aircraft delivery and retirement expectations are subject to Boeing's production capability and we will react as quickly as possible if any further adjustments are needed with the focus on taking care of our customers and aligning with our financial goals.\nLastly, I am immensely grateful for our balance sheet strength as we move through another challenging year. We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash and short-term investments with a nearly $1 billion reduction from the prior quarter, driven by the payout of a labor agreement ratification bonuses, which are onetime in nature.\nIn addition, we returned $215 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and paid $8 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations. Finally, and most notably, I am proud to report we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, both Moody's and Fitch affirmed our rating during first quarter, and S&P reviewed and moved our rating unchanged.\nAs ever, maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet is our utmost priority. As I close, I want to reiterate that we are not starting the year as we had hoped, and that is undeniably disappointing. However, throughout my years as this wonderful company, I have come to know that a better Southwest is often formed on the heels of adversity. I agree with Bob that is all because of the fight and warrior spirit of our people. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nSenior VP & CMO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. As Bob mentioned, I'm going to provide you with details on our first quarter revenue performance and base trends. I'll also share an outlook for the second quarter and full year, along with what we are assuming in the guide. And most importantly, I will give you some color on the additional actions we are taking to further improve our revenue performance.\nStarting with first quarter, unit revenue finished roughly flat on 11% capacity growth, both on a year-over-year basis. The variance to our original guidance is driven by a balance of higher-than-expected completion factor, close-in leisure volumes that came in below our expectations in the month of March and underperformance in select development markets. Development markets as a portfolio did not meet the maturation expectations, but the story isn't the same for all markets. Several development markets outperformed expectations, particularly Florida Beach destinations. But a few markets weighed down the portfolio. As Bob shared, we have made the difficult decision to address underperforming stations with closures effective August 4 and also to restructure and reduce capacity in other underperforming markets which are included in our updated June schedule.\nDespite coming in below our expectations, first quarter had strong demand, setting numerous records, including record first quarter operating revenue, ancillary revenue, passenger revenue and record first quarter passengers carried, and we also added a quarterly record number of new Rapid Reward members into the program.\nIn addition to these records, we were also really pleased to see the continued incremental benefits from our investments in managed business as first quarter managed business revenue grew 25% year-over-year and was roughly flat to 2019 levels. We continue to pick up market share year-over-year as we perform in line with or above the rest of the industry.\nFinally, from a geographical perspective, we saw the strongest year-over-year improvements coming from the West Coast and the Northeast, regions where demand has been slower to return post COVID. I also want to stress that we had a better than historically normal sequential trend in nominal unit revenue. We are seeing improvement in revenue productivity and demand. Nominal RASM in the first quarter came in flat to fourth quarter despite first quarter historically being seasonally softer than fourth quarter. And this is particularly true in a post-COVID environment where peaks and troughs are magnified.\nTo illustrate this point, consider 2018, the most recent year in which Easter fell in the last weekend of March. Nominal RASM declined sequentially 5 points. So even in the seasonally challenged quarter, the sequential performance was much better than our best holiday comparison. The most significant driver of this sequential improvement was our network optimization efforts, but we also saw a benefit from our other revenue initiatives especially managed business investments.\nLooking to second quarter, we expect our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue performance. In fact, we expect an all-time quarterly record for operating revenue. Second quarter 2024 RASM after being calibrated for recent booking trends is now expected to decrease in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year comparison includes a little over 1 point of headwind for holiday timing, both from outbound Easter shifting to the first quarter and for more outbound for the July travel shifting to third quarter.\nOn a nominal sequential basis, this also implies another quarter of better than seasonally normal RASM improvement. Looking beyond second quarter, network planning teams are still reworking schedules in the back half of the year to accommodate Boeing delivery delays. After adjusting expectations for both current booking trends and for Boeing delivery delays, we are forecasting 2024 operating revenue growth to approach high single digits on a year-over-year basis. This expected revenue growth implies healthy RASM growth in the back half of the year driven by revenue initiatives as well as a reduction in year-over-year trips.\nWhile our development market maturation efforts are off track, which I'll discuss in a moment, our other revenue initiatives are expected to continue to drive value over the balance of the year. In fact, network optimization benefits contributed roughly $100 million in incremental revenue in March alone, primarily from reductions to shoulder flying early morning and late evening flights and short haul flying. For full year, the incremental year-over-year pretax profits from our strategic initiatives is now estimated to be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion after being updated for first quarter actual performance, development market adjustments and capacity changes in the back half of the year.\nThe vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 continue to be revenue related. So while we are encouraged to see strong demand for our brand and solid sequential improvement, it is short of our goals. And as Bob and Tammy shared, it's simply not enough given the escalation of market-driven inflationary cost pressures. Therefore, we are taking actions to generate both immediate and longer-term revenue enhancements.\nWe have stood up cross-functional teams to focus on things like accelerating the maturation of development markets further boost the value being delivered by our relatively new revenue management system and roll out new products and highlight our superior value proposition with our new brand campaign. We also have a larger team that is finalizing a more significant set of strategic initiatives, and they're tasked with delivering transformational streams of revenue productivity. Of course, we'll have more to share on this topic at Investor Day.\nAs we build our plans, we will focus on leveraging our strengths, including those of our network, which, while it has optimization opportunities, remains incredibly relevant and well positioned based on size and population migration trends. We continue to hold the top position in 22 of the largest 50 domestic markets, and we are by far the market leader in that regard. Also, we're well positioned for the future as population and GDP growth trends are forecast to be strongest in the Southern and Mountain West regions of the country, regions where we have significant leadership.\nWe'll also lean into the customer experience we deliver. Year-to-date, our Trip Net Promoter Score is up over 5 points year-over-year. And finally, we continue to enhance our award-winning Rapid Rewards program just this week, we began rolling out the ability to book and pay with part cash and part Rapid Rewards points, which I expect to be very popular with our customers. So in closing, we have a large and relevant network, a strong demand environment and a loyal and highly engaged customer base. We also have the best people whom I want to sincerely thank and we are committed to being aggressive and innovative as we adapt, adjust and evolve to meet the preferences of our customers and to unlock the revenue productivity required to meet our financial imperatives. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by thanking our incredible Southwest employees for continuing to deliver a strong operational performance. We produced a solid first quarter completion factor of 98.5%, our highest first quarter performance over the past 5 years. We delivered year-over-year improvement in early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and methanol [ bakery ] and again saw a year-over-year improvement in our net Trip Net Promoter Score, as Ryan mentioned. Our on-time performance declined slightly year-over-year, largely due to weather challenges and delays driven by ATC programs.\nHowever, I'm pleased to report that we improved year-over-year on-time performance for the month of March. I'm proud of the hard work and investments made to bolster our win preparedness and modernize our operations, and I'm encouraged to see these efforts pay off in our operational performance.\nPicking up with Bob and Tammy left off, I want to stress that we remain focused on bringing out operational [ inefficiencies ], increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. Our Southwest Turn initiative, which Bob shared is tracking ahead of schedule is a critical component of these efforts.\nOne of the key elements include eliminating the need for printing on every flight, reducing the number of employee trips up and down the jet bridge and we're covering faster during the regular operations. We reached an important milestone in this multiyear effort just last week with the launch of electronic fight folders, which modernized several of our flight planning processes by digitizing documents used by our pilots, dispatchers and ops agents.\nWe also continue to make progress on modernizing the airport experience, and that initiative is also coming together faster than originally planned. Our efforts for improving the lobby customer experience are on track to provide improvement to staffing standards ahead of the original schedule. We are working on updated schedules and look forward to sharing those with you as well.\nI'd also like to highlight a new application called SkyPath we recently implemented [indiscernible] for pilots and dispatchers to provide better awareness of turbulence along the flight path. This industry-leading system uses iPad sensors and GPS data from pilot's electronic flight bags to turbulence in real time, aggregating and sharing data from across -- from users across several airlines in North America. Our teams worked cross-functionally to accelerate the launch of this app for the spring season when we tend to see more turbulence across the network. And it's another tool we can use to support employees with additional information for decision-making, improve the onboard experience for customers and reduce operational risk.\nWe look forward to sharing more on these and expensive of multiyear initiative-based efforts at Investor Day in September. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating all of our employees who reached agreements on new contracts over the past year or a little bit more than a year plus. Each contract requires a significant amount of work. And as always, we remain committed to rewarding our deserved employees. With that, I'll turn it back over to Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, Andrew. That completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. To allow for as many calls as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up if needed. We will now take the first question."

My name is Gary, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\n[indiscernible] Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter '23 Conference Call. In just a moment, Lee will share our prepared remarks after which, we'll be happy to take your questions. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance. and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Julie, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We are also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather -- winter weather events, including the extended nationwide winter storms we experienced this month, but also with other types of disruptions such as hurricanes, severe fall in Chicago and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crude networks remain stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers.\nWe also got fully staffed, restored our network and reached the full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year, with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on 9 contracts in a little over a year, demonstrating our commitment to providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments, the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long term.\nWe also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance. We continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-end performance strength in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue. And we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pretax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule, where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering towards our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March.\nWhile we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures with efficiency improvements. These include everything from scheduling techniques to digital modernization and we planned in 2024 with head count flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns, ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent returns is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely and we'll provide you a lot more detail later this year at Investor Day.\nIn addition, we're working on a next 7 initiatives to support -- in support of sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience, and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, 2023 wasn't without challenges, but we are stronger and ready to take on another year, and that is all thanks to our incredible employees. We delivered $986 million in profits for the year and our fourth quarter net income of $233 million, both when excluding special items, was on the better side of our expectations. We prioritize the restoration of our network and operational reliability in 2023, which has taken a lot of resources and focus. With our operations now stable and the network fully restored, we can drive much more focus in energy to consistently delivering a strong financial performance, along with delivering operational excellence. We have incredible strengths to build upon and the levers we need to optimize and regain our position as an industry leader.\nWe will be steadfast in our efforts to make meaningful progress this year in support of our long-term goal of generating consistent returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Ryan and Andrew will cover the headway we've made with our revenue and operations performance in detail. So I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet.\nOverall, our unit cost, excluding special items, were down 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter average fuel price of $3 per gallon was right at the low end of guidance, primarily due to jet fuel prices in the L.A. market steady after significantly spiking in mid-November. Thankfully, market prices dropped as we moved into this year and our fuel price guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon for the first quarter and $2.55 to $2.65 per gallon for the full year and the welcome reduction in fuel costs compared with 2023. We are currently 60% hedged here in first quarter and 57% hedged for the full year with more meaningful hedge protection kicking in at Brent prices around $90 per barrel. That's a higher strike price than where our 2023 hedges began to provide meaningful protection, which was closer to $70 per barrel. This is reflective of the current market conditions and elevated cost of hedging. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, nearing 20% hedged and are currently 46% hedged in 2025 in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not fully immune to the volatile energy market, I am grateful that our hedging positions provide meaningful protection against catastrophic increases, while also allowing us to participate fully when market prices decline.\nMoving to nonfuel cost. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X decrease of 18.1% was on the favorable side of our guidance range, driven primarily by elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of the operational disruption. This was partially offset by general inflationary cost pressures, including higher labor rates for all employee work groups as well as elevated maintenance expense. Both of which are sticky as we move into 2024. I also want to congratulate our pilots on their newly ratified contract. Obviously, the market for pilot wages has increased significantly, and it is important that we keep pace to reward our employees appropriately. As a result of the new agreement, we recorded a change in estimate for the pilot ratification bonus, and you can find the details and breakout of the accounting treatment in this morning's press release.\nLooking to first quarter 2024, we currently estimate our CASM-X to increase in the range of 6% to 7% year-over-year. roughly 3 to 4 points of this estimated increase is driven by higher overall 2024 labor cost and market wage rate accruals. The remainder of the first quarter CASM-X increase is primarily due to year-over-year pressure in maintenance expense driven by rate increases as well as an increase in maintenance activity as our 800s are coming off their honeymoon period.\nSpeaking to full year cost. Our CASM-X guidance of a 6% to 7% increase year-over-year is also essentially driven by labor and maintenance cost pressures. Roughly 4 to 5 points is attributable to labor and roughly 2 points is from maintenance for the reasons I previously covered. While we accrue for market wage rates, the recently ratified pilot contract, contributes the majority of the labor CASM-X increase this year due to a step-up in wage rates, work rule changes and enhanced benefits. As Bob mentioned, we are steadfastly focused on regaining efficiencies to help counter some of the structural cost pressures as we look to control what's controllable. We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and returns you should expect from Southwest Airlines. We have a solid 2024 plan, which includes the benefit of roughly $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pretax profits from our strategic initiatives. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 are revenue related, contributing well over $1 billion of the $1.5 billion total expected incremental benefit. And our network optimization and market maturation efforts are providing the bulk of that revenue lift. The balance of the revenue generating benefits come from incremental managed business initiatives, primarily increased GDS participation.\nThe incremental cost benefit relates primarily to fleet monetization and early yields from other operating efficiency efforts such as digital service modernization and our turn initiative. We will go into a lot more detail on our initiative portfolio at Investor Day later this year. While early, our plan provides significant progress towards our long-term goal to generate ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. Again, more details to come at our 2024 Investor Day. Now turning to our fleet. During 2023, we received a total of 86-8 deliveries, one more than planned and retired 39-700 to less than planned, ending the year with a total of 817 aircraft. We consistently mentioned the flexibility in our fleet modernization efforts being a key competitive advantage and the minor shifting of deliveries and retirements throughout 2023 validates our ability to thoughtfully plan and execute given the continued supply chain challenges facing Boeing.\nMoving into 2024, there is continued uncertainty around the timing of expected Boeing deliveries and the certification of the MAX 7 aircraft. Our fleet plans remain nimble and currently differs from our contractual order book with Boeing. We are planning for 79 aircraft deliveries this year and expect to retire roughly 45-700 and 4-800, resulting in a net expected increase of 30 aircraft this year. Taking our current plan into consideration, we expect our 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. After finalizing our 2024 plans and refining capacity levels to better reflect the current environment, we now expect full year 2024 capacity to be up about 6% year-over-year. And our 2024 capacity plans do not currently include any MAX 7 flying. So a certification of that aircraft continues to push out our 2024 capacity plans will not be impacted. In addition, we are also reducing our total fuel expense with our fleet modernization initiatives as we continue to bring on more fuel-efficient -8 aircraft and retire -700. We saw a nearly 3% year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency in 2023 and and expect continued improvement this year.\nIn addition to fuel savings, our fleet modernization initiative is a key component in reaching our environmental sustainability goals. Lastly, I am proud to report that our balance sheet strength continues to be a financial backbone as we move into another year. We remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended the year with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, returned $428 million to our shareholders through dividend payments in 2023, paid $85 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in 2023 and continue to be in a net cash position. We expect to pay a modest $29 million in debt payments this year and continue to expect interest income to well exceed our expected interest expense of $249 million in 2024. So we are pleased to have a plan for significant financial improvement to be made this year with some major milestones behind us, such as restoring our network, becoming fully staffed, fully utilizing our fleet and so much more. Our sites are set on expanding margins and covering our cost of capital in 2024. And as I close, I'd like to sincerely thank our people for another year of hard work and dedication to the mission and vision of Southwest Airlines. I am so grateful for each and every one of you. You were truly my heroes. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nSenior VP & CMO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy, and hello, everyone. Let me start by sharing that I am very pleased with the overall demand for our business, the execution from our amazing people and the engagement of our loyal customers. Fourth quarter unit revenue finished slightly better than expectations at down 8.9% year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a strengthening of close-in revenue performance in November and December for both leisure and corporate business travel as well as the continuation of overall strong holiday performance and market share gains from our managed business initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we saw no bookings impact from last year's operational disruption during this past holiday season, which speaks to the operational improvements we have made over the last year as well as the enduring loyalty from our customers. In addition, fourth quarter was another quarter with multiple record set, including record fourth quarter operating revenue and passenger revenue as well as an all-time quarterly record for passengers carry. Fares also performed well in the fourth quarter, with our average passenger fare up about 2.5% year-over-year. And all in all, our fourth quarter operating revenues were up over $1 billion relative to fourth quarter of 2019. And while we still have work to do on our revenue performance, I remain very pleased with our progress.\nLooking to our full year results, we grew 2023 operating revenues nearly 10% year-over-year to a record $26 billion accompanied by record passengers, record Rapid Rewards revenue and record ancillary revenue. And speaking of records, we set operating revenue records in each quarter of the year and for the full year of 2023. As we move into 2024, we are seeing the momentum continue, and we're seeing early but highly encouraging benefits from our network optimization efforts, and we expect first quarter unit revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% when compared to the same period last year. This represents a solid sequential improvement in year-over-year unit revenue performance even when normalized for the 5-point tailwind from the prior year disruption impact. In fact, I would imply first quarter 2024 nominal RASM to be about 5 points higher than our normal seasonal sequential average when compared with nominal fourth quarter of 2023 RASM. We currently have about 60% of expected bookings for first quarter already in place, slightly above normal, and we are seeing better-than-normal sequential RASM performance. Further demonstrating that our network optimization efforts are working.\nAs we refined our capacity plans for this year, we've been able to pull in even more flying out of the shoulder periods, which we believe will be a tangible contributor in boosting our performance. While our forecast doesn't assume any material increase in demand for domestic air travel in 2024, we do have a line of sight to double-digit operating revenue growth year-over-year, driven largely by the network and initiative-driven revenue that Tammy detail. Included in that, of course, is our efforts to drive managed business. We are very pleased with the performance of our managed business initiatives and the success of our Southwest business team. In the past year, we had a solid increase in market share, more than 3 points in the managed business space and I'm very proud we improved our Business Travel News ranking from fourth place in the industry in 2019 to second place in 2023. We were the only carrier on the survey to receive an increased total score 2 years in a row while each of our competitors' scores have declined over that same period. It's another example of the progress we're making against the industry in the managed business space.\nOf course, we're also continuing our efforts to improve our customer experience and our Rapid Rewards program. We are seeing improved customer satisfaction scores with our WiFi product as we proceed with our infrastructure investments there, and more aircraft are joining the fleet every day within sea power and larger bins on board. We've made several enhancements to our award-winning Rapid Rewards program, including making it easier to reach our A-List and A-List preferred levels and we will soon be rolling out the ability to book travel with a combination of cash plus Rapid Reward points later this spring. We introduced customer bag tracking to reduce friction in our customers' travel experience and we look forward to sharing more on our larger digital hospitality modernization plan in the coming months. All of this is designed to make it easier to fly with us and give customers even more reasons to choose Southwest. As we enter 2024, we have a very solid plan that leverages the unparalleled strength of our people, our product, our loyalty program and our route network, and we look forward to delivering on continued progress towards our long-term financial goals. With that, Andrew, over to you.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by recognizing our people for their efforts in successfully managing through four different named winter storms which was spread over 11 days and impacted a wide portion of our route network with intense weather conditions and frigid temperatures this month. These overlapping winter systems definitely put our winter operations [indiscernible] plan to the test. Overall, I'm very pleased with how well we manage the storms. The sheer magnitude of these weather systems resulted in significant cancellations, the vast majority of which were proactive on our part. Our cancellations were made 14 hours in advance on average and 70% were canceled with at least 6 hours in advance. As you can imagine, providing that much notice improves the customer experience. In fact, we have found that it can result in MPS scores that approximate those with customers with no disruption to their itinerary. Overall cancellation rates were in line with the industry and were primarily isolated to the operations directly impacted by the storms.\nWith fewer than 2% of our cancellations tied to crew scheduling challenges. This is a significant contrast to what we experienced with winter storm Elliott in December 2022. The improvement is directly the result of last year's winter operations investments and protocols. I echo Bob's sentiments that we are in a much better spot today than a year ago. In the past year, we not only completed the winter operations preparedness plan, we also delivered on a long list of initiatives to modernize our operation with benefits for both our customers and our employees. Our people have the staffing, equipment, tools and infrastructure to operate safely and at pace in winter weather. The good news is that all the hard work showed up in our operating performance. We closed out 2023 with only about 1% of our total flights canceled and we improved in basically every metric. Our completion factor, on-time performance, early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled baggery, all showed substantial year-over-year improvement, which in turn led to a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score.\nAs we enter 2024, we will focus on continuing to build on our 2023 priority of operating quality. We ranked fourth place in the 2023 Wall Street Journal Airline Quality Metrics despite several of the metrics covering the winter storm Eliot period. Our goal is to move up this ranking and ultimately be ranked #1. We will also double down on 3 additional priorities: bringing out operating inefficiencies, increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. These are multiyear initiative-based efforts, which will begin yielding material benefits in 2025. We'll share more on these in the coming months. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating our pilots on our new contract. I'd also like to thank all the negotiating teams who have worked so hard to reach 9 agreements since October of 2022. These teams work tirelessly and I am pleased we can reward employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality of life enhancements. We remain in negotiations with two union represented groups, TW 555 and TW 556 and we look forward to reaching agreements to reward those employees for their contributions. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nThank you, Andrew. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please go ahead with the first question."

My name is Jamie, and I will be moderating today's conference. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the floor over to Ms. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am please go ahead.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nThank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. We also reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. Please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information.\nWith that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thanks, Julia, and good morning, everyone. Before we jump into the financials, I wanted to acknowledge that there have been heart-wrenching challenges around the world the past several months, and we've had natural disasters in the communities that we serve. Earlier this quarter, I visited our team in Maui and witnessed firsthand the impacts from the catastrophic wildfires on the island. Our hearts go out to all those who are suffering, and we're really proud of the support we are providing, including the volunteer efforts of our employees.\nNow moving to the results. Operating revenues for the third quarter were just over $6.5 billion, up nearly 5% from the same period last year and a third quarter record. Despite the recent uptick in fuel prices and other inflationary pressures, we are again profitable with net income of $240 million, excluding special items.\nRevenue strength was driven by solid leisure demand throughout the quarter and by managed business continuing to come in largely as expected. And Ryan will share more details with you, but overall, demand remains healthy.\nAs we close out this quarter and look ahead to the end of the year, we are very pleased with our accomplishments. We are running a great operation, reaching significant milestones, completing important initiatives and delivering great customer experience enhancements.\nWe're making great progress on labor agreements, including yesterday's announcement of a tentative agreement with our incredible flight attendants. The team will walk you through many of these accomplishments, but for now, I want to talk to you about immediate actions we are taking to adapt to the current demand environment and solidify our path to operational and financial excellence.\nPerhaps our biggest milestone is completion of our network restoration plan in the fourth quarter of this year. Reaching this milestone has obviously been a year's long effort and has taken heroic coordination across the entire organization. It's just incredibly challenging, and I am so appreciative of every single employee. It truly was a whole company accomplishment.\nWith this behind us, [indiscernible], we are set up really well to focus on optimizing our business. That starts with reflowing the fleet order book to support orderly growth. And to that end, we just announced a new order book with our partner, Boeing, yet another milestone. This sets us up for orderly and measured growth and gives us flexibility to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have a lot of options as we move forward, and we will plan in a way that allows us both the flexibility to move up or down, and this order book, combined with opportunities to retire 700s and modernize our fleet supports that really well.\nFinally, as we move into 2024, we are carefully evaluating the current macro environment and post-pandemic travel behaviors to create the best possible plan for the company. We are now planning for a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in nominal ASMs in the first quarter of 2024. This will result in capacity growth on a year-over-year basis of approximately 10% to 12% and all of which is carryover from growth this year.\nNote that this is a reduction from what we shared in July, which was an expectation to grow approximately 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023. Therefore, the full year -- for the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.\nThis plan offers us the ability to redirect the teams that have worked so effectively to get a staff and restored to now focus on better optimizing the operation. We will be relentless in our focus to bring out inefficiencies drive productivity, increase reliability and our goal to return margins to historic levels. We are still hard at work on both our 2024 and long-term plans, but we are building them with a priority and a focus on generating value, value for employees, value for our customers and, of course, value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd like to extend another thanks to our wonderful employees for their continued hard work this year, especially in a challenging environment. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance, so I will jump right to cost.\nBeginning with fuel, our third quarter jet fuel price was $2.78 per gallon towards the higher end of our guidance. as crude oil prices consistently rose throughout the quarter, peaking to nearly $100 per barrel in late September and rising refinery margins added further pressure to our third quarter fuel price.\nMoving into fourth quarter, we currently estimate our fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, which includes an estimated $0.19 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.85 to $2.95 per gallon range, including $0.14 of hedging gains.\nThe total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for fourth quarter through 2026 is $538 million. We added modestly to our fuel hedge position for 2026 during third quarter. We continue to be roughly 50% hedged in 2023 and are currently 55% hedged in 2024, in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year.\nWhile we are not immune to rising oil prices, I am grateful that our hedging positions relieve some of the additional pressure. We continue to look for prudent opportunities to build out our hedge positions for future years.\nMoving to nonfuel costs. Our third quarter year-over-year CASM x increase of 4.4% was right in line with our previous guidance range driven primarily by higher labor rates for all employee work groups and the timing of planned maintenance expenses.\nLooking ahead to fourth quarter, we currently estimate our CASM X to decrease significantly year-over-year. There is a lot of noise in the year-over-year comparisons and the magnitude of the decrease is primarily due to impacts from elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of last year's operational disruption.\nOur guidance range is inclusive of wage rate increases associated with the recently announced tentative agreement with our flight attendants. You can find additional details in this morning's press release.\nGiven inflationary pressures, particularly labor rates, combined with moderated capacity growth, we are expecting increased headwinds to our 2024 year-over-year cost. While we hit major milestones this year, our margins are not where they need to be, and we intend to be relentless until we deliver. We, therefore, plan to adapt our network and capacity plans to support both a reliable operation and improved returns on investments. Given our company's commitment and history towards maintaining a competitive cost advantage, our goal will always be to manage costs accordingly.\nNow turning to our fleet. During the third quarter, we received a total of 18 -8 deliveries and retired 4 -700s, ending the quarter with a fleet of 817 total aircraft. And we just finalized a new order book with Boeing, which funds our long-term mid-single-digit growth plan and provides us the ability to phase out the -700 fleet over time. But really, it gives us just a lot of flexibility.\nWe provided full details on the new order book in this morning's release. We now expect to receive 85 -8s this year and plan to retire 41 -700s. This leaves our net expected increase of 44 aircraft unchanged from our previous guidance. Taking all this into consideration, our 2023 CapEx outlook remains approximately $3.5 billion.\nLooking to 2024, reiterating what Bob shared we are planning for capacity levels that better match the current environment. We now expect 2024 capacity to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. With our new order book, we have the fleet flexibility we need to organize the company around a disciplined financial plan, one, that we can adjust up or down to adapt to the current environment. We continue to expect our 5-year capital spending on average to be in line with our previous guidance of roughly $4 billion per year.\nLastly, our balance sheet remains strong. We are the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. We have $11.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we continue to be in a net cash position. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $400 million to our shareholders through dividend payments and made debt repayments of nearly $80 million. Closing out the year, we expect to pay a modest $7 million in scheduled debt repayments and continue to expect our 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense.\nLet me close by saying, I am tremendously proud of our people and their hard work. As we look ahead, it is imperative we remain focused on building our 2024 plans and beyond to provide a resolute path to prosperity for our company, our employees and our shareholders. We have a history that proves we do not rest on our laurels, and I'm confident we have all the elements needed to bring about the success you should expect from Southwest Airlines.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nSenior VP & CMO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. I'm going to walk through a review of our third quarter revenue results, provide context for our fourth quarter outlook and share some exciting commercial updates with you today. For additional detail on our revenue performance, please see this morning's earnings release. Starting with third quarter.\nDemand continues to be healthy. Operating revenue was a third quarter record of just over $6.5 billion. And on a year-over-year basis, operating revenue was up nearly 5%, and that's on a tough compare period given pent-up domestic travel was still underway last year. When you compare revenue performance versus third quarter of 2019, operating revenue is up nearly 16% on 12% capacity growth. Also, average fares were up 2.6% year-over-year and are up over 7% over third quarter 2019. So while we have work to do to cover our unit cost challenges, I am pleased we are moving in the right direction.\nThe nearly 5% operating revenue growth year-over-year on a capacity increase of 12.5% had unit revenue or RASM declining 6.8% for the third quarter of 2023. The July 4 and Labor Day travel came right in line with our expectations. However, bookings for nonpeak August and September, while stable came in at the lower end of our expectations. This performance aligns with fall start dates for primary and secondary schools continuing to shift earlier in much of the country.\nFor example, in our markets, 1/3 of schools were back in session by the second week of August, which is nearly double what it was pre-pandemic, and nearly 95% of schools were back before the Labor Day weekend. We are planning for these back-to-school trends to continue as we work on our August 2024 capacity plans.\nIn addition, we had multiple records set from our ancillary products and our loyalty program. We had an all-time best quarter for ancillary revenue with 24% year-over-year growth and Rapid Rewards set a third quarter record for revenue generated from the program. New Rapid Rewards member acquisitions were a quarterly record, and the number of engaged members grew 10% on a year-over-year basis.\nRapid Rewards point redemptions were up 16% compared to the same period last year, and retail spend on our co-brand Chase credit card was also a third quarter record. Our customers love the benefits they get from the card as evidenced by our low cardholder attrition, which continues to be below pre-pandemic levels.\nOverall, we see a resilient consumer and high engagement with the Southwest Airlines brand. Consumer spending trends still favor services, particularly travel experiences, and we expect that will continue.\nMoving to the fourth quarter. We're seeing a continuation of healthy leisure booking demand and stable business travel patterns. As a result, we expect a nominal sequential increase in operating revenue resulting in record fourth quarter revenue and passengers, which would bring us to 3 consecutive quarters of record operating revenue. October performance has been strong to date, and bookings for the holidays as a whole are also strong.\nRASM, however, continues to be impacted by higher than seasonally normal capacity, driven by our network restoration plan, a larger-than-normal investment in development markets, and business travel that while improving is still below historical levels.\nWe also expect the close-in leisure trends we saw in non-peak August and September will persist into the non-holiday periods of the fourth quarter and our guidance range does contemplate potential challenges from this year's holiday placement, including the expectation that a portion of return travel will spill into January.\nI am encouraged, however, that we have higher booked load factors for the December holiday period this year than we had at the same point last year, which indicates to me we're not experiencing significant book away as a result of last year's operational disruption. All in, we expect RASM in the fourth quarter to finish down 9% to 11% on a year-over-year basis on capacity up approximately 21%.\nAgain, we are steadfastly committed to addressing RASM performance to ensure a revenue plan that is appropriate for the current demand and cost environment. In the near term, we are continuing to execute a strategy of fair sale campaigns to address low-demand flights with meaningful advanced purchase requirements. This helps build load factor and suboptimal capacity without impacting higher demand flights or diluting close and yield strength.\nLooking to 2024, as Bob mentioned, we will address RASM by moderating capacity to better match demand and optimizing our schedules to accommodate current travel behaviors. Our current set of strategic initiatives, including GDS participation and the new revenue management system, will also contribute incremental pretax profits to 2024 as they mature and hit their full run rates.\nFinally, we're tireless in working to make customer experience on Southwest Airlines even better and drive even more loyalty from our customers. Earlier this month, we announced several exciting updates and the first involves several enhancements to our award-winning Rapid Rewards program.\nWe will add the ability for customers to combine Rapid Reward points with cash next spring, which increases the ubiquity of our loyalty currency and makes it easier to book additional flights on Southwest Airlines. We also made it easier to reach our A-List and A-List preferred levels in 2024, and are looking to reward our customers for their loyalty and entice them to fly with us whenever they travel. We have an imperative to win more customers and drive more travel from our most frequent travelers and these enhancements are designed to give them even more reasons to choose Southwest Airlines.\nWe also launched a new product for our corporate customers last week that will help us continue to grow our market share in the managed travel space. Our new product streamlines the process to book group travel for meetings, incentives and conventions, which is 1 of the fastest-growing segments in the managed travel space. I'm very pleased with the response to the product so far, as we already have millions of dollars in travel booked on the new tool in just the first few days.\nFinally, we recently introduced customer bag tracking, which gives our customers the ability to track their checked bags throughout their day of travel both at the airport and in flight. This improvement was 1 of the investments we accelerated following last December's disruption.\nBy providing additional transparency and information to customers about where their bags are during their travel journey, we're elevating the travel experience and removing friction for our customers. This enhancement is an early release of our larger digital hospitality modernization plan. So congratulations to the teams that worked so hard to bring these great enhancements and solutions to market for our customers.\nUltimately, we have to continue to win customers while taking into account the challenges of higher cost inputs as we build both our long-term commercial strategies and our near-term revenue plans, and we're committed to doing just that.\nWith that, I'll turn it day over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'm going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a brief overview of our operational performance, an update on our winter operations action plan and some additional details on our capacity and network plans for next year.\nBefore I dive into those details, I want to commend both negotiating committees that work diligently on intentive agreement just reach our flight attendants, which will be voted on by our employee [indiscernible]. This agreement offers industry-leading compensation increases and quality of life enhancements I'm very pleased with our strong improvements in operational performance and very appreciative of our Southwest warriors.\nWe saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics, which are recognized by our customers through increased Trip Net Promoter Scores. Our early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential, completion factor, mishandled bag rate, long delay rate and on-time performance, all showed substantial year-over-year improvement.\nIf not for longer-than-anticipated block times from congestion, weather and runway construction, our performance would have been even better. All of this resulted in a trip Net Promoter Score that is nearly 4 points higher than last year. That is certainly driven by our proven reliability, but also our customer experience initiatives, including our improved WiFi. We're excited about the solid trend in the right direction. It gives us lots of reasons to be optimistic about 2024.\nAnd speaking of the right direction, I'm excited to share an update on our winter preparedness. The disruption we had last winter was really hard on our customers and our employees. It weighed heavily on all of us here at Southwest Airlines. We have a lot of pride based on our 50-plus year history. So preparing to prevent something like that from happening again was and is an imperative.\nBefore disruption was triggered by an unprecedented storm that simultaneously hit several of our most critical stations. But there were many causes, not just one. That led to it. As a result, our action plan is divided into 3 categories: winter operations, cross-team collaboration, and accelerating operational investments, which were already on our road map, including technology.\nOne thing that really impacted us with Elliott is that 25% of our crew are based in Denver and Chicago. When we are unable to maintain sufficient throughput during winter operations, we can't get our crew out into the network. When this happens, it puts great stress on our crew network, which is what happened, Elliot.\nSo a key part of our action plan is to have more robust winter operations, so we can be confident that we get our crews out in the network to operate through bad weather. So we invest in key stations. Based on calculated throughput needed to maintain our crude network, we have added the ice pads, the ice trucks, increased glycol storage and mixing stations increased snow removal, heater carts and other equipment to operate safely and effectively in winter weather.\nWe have been conducting the [indiscernible] summer school to make sure we have plenty of ramp agents trained and ready to go for DIC. That's just a few examples of tangible things we have done. We are now so much better prepared for these extreme weather events.\nMoving to cross team collaboration. We now have our network planning and network operations teams under the same organization. allowing them to work together to make the best decisions quickly. We have formed a special operating group called the network disruption pod, the coordinated decision-making in our control center when there are high-risk disruption events, and I've used this group for events of summer.\nAdditionally, we have conducted multiple operations wide tabletop exercises, often called war games involving winter weather scenarios to prepare our teams for the season. And we have talked a lot already about the immediate modernization of an enhancement to our systems. Early on, there was a misconception that technology problems caused an operational disruption. It was the opposite operational problems caused technology problems.\nSince the disruption, we've bolstered those systems with upgrades to address the specific issues we experienced during winter storm Elliott. We're also rolling out a proprietary new system that is unique in the industry. I take the crew first approach when developing solutions to large-scale irregular operations. I share all that detail and really those are just a few examples to demonstrate the level of action we have taken were up better than ever and feel confident as we go into the holiday winter holiday travel season.\nFinally, I'll wrap up by talking a little bit more about what we're doing with capacity and the network next year to ensure that we're on a path to operational and financial excellence. Going back to April, we committed to orderly and measured growth. Stable growth helps us regain efficiency, absorb our hiring, mature workforce and improve our operational performance.\nWe also have to take into consideration demand levels and travel patterns as we determine our growth and build our network. As we develop our 2024 capacity set, we are doing exactly that. In the past couple of years, we focus on growth to restore our network and fully utilize our fleet. That, combined with business travel trends and our investments in Hawaii in new cities has created challenges to our current unit revenue performance. Therefore, as we look to 2024, we are moderating our capacity, which will allow the growth to be absorbed.\nAnd as we shared last quarter, we are taking actions to accelerate the maturation of our developing markets and to optimize our schedules to current travel patterns. The most recent examples at today's announcement, they were shifting the bulk of the international service in Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. This will offer better connectivity in our domestic network via the nearly 140 daily departures at MCO.\nWe are fully committed to delivering on a plan that enables operational excellence, improved operational efficiency and reiterating what Bob said at the beginning of the call that generates value for our employees, customers and shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia.\n\nJulia Landrum\n\nThank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Julian Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Ryan Green and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning. and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to report a solid quarter with net income of $693 million, excluding special items, and all-time record quarterly revenue of just over $7.0 billion. The demand environment, especially for leisure travel continues to be resilient as we have seen solid bookings throughout the busy summer travel season. Now further, we continue to expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pretax profit contribution in full year 2023 for strategic initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day last December. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect record operating revenue and solid profits in third quarter 2023 and year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. I especially want to thank our people for doing such a fantastic job. They helped us get a record number of customers and a record number of bags on a record number of flights successfully to their destinations as we experienced the lowest second quarter flight cancellation rate in the past 10 years. It wasn't without trials. We had a lot going on in the operation related to weather and weather has continued to be a challenge here in July.\nDespite that, our employees have continued to deliver a very solid performance. From our network ops control center to the front line, our people have worked together extremely well to minimize cancellations and produce a very reliable operation. And I'm just so proud of them for getting our customers where they need to go despite a challenging operational environment. While the cost outlook has increased for the year, the change is primarily driven by updates to our market wage rate accruals for open collective bargaining agreements. And while fluid, we're making progress. It's obviously very hard work, and I'm just very appreciative of the dedication of everybody involved in the negotiation process. Now thinking about where we are with the business, since 2018, we have seen very significant swings due to the grounding of the MAX. Demand fall off, of course, from COVID, then the stress from the resurgence of demand disruptions from post pandemic supply chain issues, challenges with employee staffing and most recently, uncertainty with our Boeing aircraft deliveries. The challenges we have faced since 2018 have made planning difficult so smoothing out fluctuations is a must. And the best way to do that is with smooth and predictable capacity growth.\nWe told you back in April that we were reflowing our order book to allow for orderly and measured growth and we're still finalizing the details of that with Boeing. But we remain confident that we will get the 70 deliveries in 2023 that are assumed for our public schedules and we are working to build a 2024 plan that should be much more stable. We currently are planning to be flying the MAX 7 at some point next year. But if not, we'll take MAX 8 instead just as we are doing now. Where that leaves us for full year 2023 capacity is unchanged for this year at up 14% to 15% year-over-year. As we shared this morning in our release, we are revamping our 2024 flight schedules. While our network is largely restored at this point, it is not optimized, especially for post-pandemic shifts and business travel. Those adjustments to the network will be largely complete by the March 2024 flight schedules, and we expect those efforts and the continued maturation of development markets to generate an incremental $500 million in pretax profit in 2024. The changes will also reduce the percentage of system capacity and development by more than half returning to normal pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year.\nWe already have our schedule published through March 6, 2024, and currently expect first quarter 2024 capacity to be up in the range of 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Now keep in mind that nearly 90% of that year-over-year growth is carryover from 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we are planning for a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth in each quarter next year as we work our way back to our long-term goal of mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. We've made a lot of progress in the first half of 2023, completing several major milestones. We quickly developed and are on track for our winter operations plan. We have the staffing plan in place to fully utilize our fleet by the end of the third quarter and have the network restored by the end of the year. Again, to be clear, it's restored but not yet optimized, and Ryan will share more on how we're going to adjust the network based on post pandemic travel patterns. But we have a lot of exciting things in the works that we believe are going to contribute to our 2024 financial results and help us deliver another year of margin expansion next year.\nIn closing, our accomplishments in 2023 lay a foundation for us to shift our focus to restoring our industry-leading financial and operational performance, boost our operational resilience and make advances in our industry-leading customer service through a focus on digital hospitality. And I just can't say this enough. I'm just so proud of our people. They are the hardest health best airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd like to extend another thanks to our employees for their commendable efforts this quarter, resulting in solid operational and financial performance, a hard-earned improvement from where we began the year. Overall, we had a really solid quarter. Operationally, we had a great completion factor, despite many weather challenges. Financially, bottom line profits were in line with our expectations despite pressure from market-driven labor accruals. We produced an all-time quarterly operating revenue record. We also generated double-digit operating margins each month during the quarter. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. I just can't thank them enough. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance, so I will jump right to cost, fleet and then balance sheet. Beginning with fuel, our second quarter jet fuel price was $2.60 per gallon, slightly above our previous guidance. Throughout second quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, hovering for the most part, around $80 per barrel. We are 49% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be similar to our second quarter fuel price, and that includes an estimated $0.08 of hedging gains.\nWe now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon range, including $0.09 of hedging gains. This is up a dime from our previous guidance due to higher refining margins. Of course, market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We are currently 54% hedged in 2024. And over the last few months, we've added meaningfully to our 2025 portfolio and began building our 2026 portfolio. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for the third quarter through 2026 is $373 million. We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protections each year. Moving to nonfuel cost. Our second quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 7.5% was towards the unfavorable end of our guidance range due to incremental adjustments to market weight trade accruals and or our open labor agreements. We have said this from the beginning, but our labor accruals are based on market and in this environment, market has obviously been dynamic. We are planning and eager to award our work groups with well-deserved compensation increases.\nLooking ahead, our nominal third quarter cost trends remain fairly consistent with second quarter. We currently estimate our third quarter CASM-X to increase in the 3.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This increase is, again, largely driven by higher labor costs. We are also continuing to incur additional maintenance expense relative to 2022 for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance, adding further pressure to our second half cost inflation. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM X to decrease in the range of 1% to 2% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 2% to 4%. The estimated 1 point increase is due primarily to higher labor cost pressures, as I've already covered. Turning to our fleet. During the second quarter, we received a total of 21 aircraft deliveries and retired 11-700 aircraft, ending the quarter with over 800 aircraft. We are working to reflow our order book with Boeing. However, for this year, we continue to plan for approximately 70-8 deliveries and 26-700 retirement which takes the fleet to 814 aircraft at year-end. Likewise, our CapEx outlook remains unchanged. And at approximately $3.5 billion, which assumes approximately $2.3 billion in aircraft capital spend.\nOur 2023 capacity guidance only remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14% to 15% year-over-year and we have tightened our third quarter capacity guidance to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, we are planning for first quarter 2024 capacity to grow 14% to 16% year-over-year. Now keep in mind, we are growing 14% to 15% in 2023, and that alone drives nearly 90% of that first quarter year-over-year growth. So the primary driver of that first quarter year-over-year growth is annualizing the additional capacity we are adding this year. But our long-term goal remains mid-single-digit year-over-year growth. Lastly, our balance sheet remains pristine and we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.2 billion, net of $67 million in debt repayments for the first half of the year. We continue to be in a net cash position and expect a modest $16 million in scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year. And currently, 2023 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2023 interest expense.\nWe declared another dividend in second quarter which was paid just a couple of weeks ago. I am proud of what we have accomplished through the first half of the year. That said, we still have work to do to return to industry-leading financial performance which is our priority as we work on our plans for next year. This includes managing the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, reflowing our order book with Boeing to support orderly measured and profitable growth and rebalancing and optimizing our network. We believe these plans, combined with our existing initiatives and the maturation of our development markets will help us expand both margins and return on invested capital in 2024 and as compared with this year. Let me close by saying my confidence in our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals is anchored by my belief in the people of Southwest Airlines and their ability to create and inspire success. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nSenior VP & CMO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThanks, Tammy. I'll walk you through our second quarter revenue results, provide context for our third quarter outlook and update you on some of our commercial priorities. And for additional detail on our revenue performance, I'll point you to this morning's earnings release. Starting with second quarter, demand continues to be resilient, especially for leisure travel. Overall, trends have remained steady with operating revenue for the first half of 2023, consistently well above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Operating revenue for second quarter was an all-time quarterly record of just over $7 billion. And in fact, we had record operating revenue in every month of the quarter. Second quarter 2023 unit revenue or RASM decreased 8.3% on a year-over-year basis on a capacity increase of 14.1%. And while it's a year-over-year decline, it's still our second highest second quarter RASM to date, which points to the tough comp we were up against from last year. And as a reminder, year-over-year RASM was impacted by a 5-point headwind from approximately $300 million of higher-than-normal breakage revenue that was recognized in the second quarter of 2022, resulting from flight credits issued during the pandemic that were set to expire prior to our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates.\nOverall, second quarter revenue came in at the favorable end of our expectations as close-in leisure held strong. Second quarter revenue from corporate travel came in largely as expected, as we realized sequential and year-over-year improvement in managed business revenue. And while travelers from some of our largest segments have reduced their frequency of their business trips from pre-pandemic levels, we're very pleased with the gains we continue to make in the managed business space. Small and medium businesses, government and educations are strong points for us, and we are growing the number of accounts we have under contract. All of this has allowed us to continue to grow our share of the managed business space in the industry and as a result of our revenue initiatives in corporate travel. We gained additional passenger market share in the second quarter and exited the quarter seeing more unique travelers flying for business than we saw pre-pandemic. Moving to the third quarter, we're seeing leisure booking and yield strength continue throughout the summer travel season with July revenue, which is essentially booked expected to also be a record.\nOf course, much of the Post Labor Day booking curve comes in closer but we're very encouraged by the response to our June fare sale for off-peak fall travel and what that suggests for continued leisure demand. We had all-time record bookings the week of our fair sale with three booking days that were top 10 all-time records and included our record day for the most bookings ever taken. In fact, we have more passengers booked for third quarter travel at this point in the curve than we did at the same point in time for second quarter. Of course, on a revenue basis, nominal yields are typically weaker sequentially third quarter versus second quarter but the strength in passengers points to the continued demand for Southwest Airlines. We currently expect overall corporate travel to have a modest underlying trend improvement, and we expect to continue our gains in industry market share. Overall, however, we expect corporate travel demand will remain lower than leisure for the foreseeable future, particularly compared with pre-pandemic. So with a higher leisure mix, and as the number of business trips taken per traveler remain down for our most frequent customers, it gives us an opportunity to look at our current network design.\nPre-pandemic, those travelers had a skew of short-haul travel with more frequent trips and also more midweek travel, and our current network is designed assuming those travel patterns would return. Moving forward, there is a revenue opportunity to adjust the network to adapt to the new travel patterns we expect to continue to see from our mix of business and leisure customers. Ultimately, this leaves us with third quarter unit revenue expected to be down 3% to 7% year-over-year on capacity up roughly 12% again on a year-over-year basis. The decline in year-over-year unit revenue is driven by capacity growing faster than seasonably typical as we restore the network and normalize the utilization of our fleet as well as tough prior year comparisons from the post-pandemic domestic demand search. So while there is still room to optimize our unit revenue efficiency, this guide implies a third quarter record for operating revenue. So again, we are in the process of adjusting our network to support our imperative of industry-leading financial performance. Starting with the January 2024 schedules, we've made changes to the composition of the network such that it supports the customer travel behavior changes I just mentioned.\nWe made changes that reflect where our customers are traveling and when they're traveling, including time of day and day of week and this optimization will be largely complete in spring of 2024. In addition, we have more than 10% of our markets under development, which will normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels over the next 12 to 18 months. So as we said in the release and as Bob mentioned earlier, the go-forward revenue opportunity from the network is substantial. And of course, we also expect continued revenue contribution growth from our existing and fully implemented revenue initiatives. Finally, we've always worked hard to consistently deliver the best hospitality and customer service here at Southwest. Our customer service is, of course, legendary, and our customer policies are industry-leading. And we are on track in deploying our onboard product initiatives, including WiFi upgrades, larger overhead bins and in-seat power. We are now focused on widening our customer service advantage through prioritization of a series of initiatives that will improve our digital hospitality and allow our customers to serve themselves in most cases. We aren't ready to provide you all the details there, but the initiatives will help us achieve our goal to deliver the best and most efficient hospitality with next-generation tools, airport layouts and more. And now with that, I'll turn it to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'm going to provide some additional details on our operational performance and a brief update on our Winter Operations Preparedness Plan. I'll have to start by commending our employees for their warrior spirits and the solid operational performance they delivered in an operationally challenging quarter. As Bob mentioned, we had record flight activity, record customers and record back counts. But we were ready. We were staffed up and we were prepared. Our completion factor in the second quarter was really pretty remarkable. We were likely achieved a flight completion factor of more than 99% in the second quarter. It was the highest second quarter performance in the past 10 years. And that is despite the challenging environment, June, in particular, had tough operating conditions. We had issues across the entire system with pretty much continuous weather disruptions. Safety is always our first priority, so we couldn't avoid some flight delays, but we are really excelled in getting customers to the destinations and with their bags. And when we had weather events, we managed to reset and be right back on track the next morning, which is a sign of good management through the regular operations by our people.\nUnderneath that headline, we saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics as on-time performance, long delays, early morning originators, turn compliance, [indiscernible] is booked and Trip Net Promoter Score, all showed solid year-over-year improvements. This was against the backdrop of runway closures in Las Vegas and Denver, which are two of our largest operations. Another drag was our block time hit rate, which dropped over 4 points relative to the second quarter last year as our pilots had to take more securitous routings because of weather. The broad-based improved performance against these headwinds is a testament to solid execution by our people. Looking forward, we're also really pleased with our progress on the implementation of our Winter Preparedness Plan. Just a reminder, so the plan is detailed on a micro site, which is available on our website. The plan is on track to be fully implemented in fourth quarter 2023 in advance of our winter storm season. I won't walk you through all the details today since it's on the microsite. But I will say that everything is going really well, and we are already accepting delivery of new equipment and infrastructure as well as completing software implementations. We are conducting summer school to trade new ramp patents on [ the ice team ] and train all ramp agents on new equipment.\nObviously, the other thing we have going on is labor negotiations, where we continue to work diligently, and we continue to make progress. I do want to thank all the parties on both sides who work hard to negotiate these collective bargain agreements. I'm grateful that we've been able to get so many ratified in the last 9 months. but we still have more to do with a couple that have been amenable for a while. We know the negotiations could be emotional as well as complicated, but we are committed to good faith negotiations to get new agreements in place as quickly as possible and to compensate our employees with market wage rates. So in closing, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. It's an honor to be part of this team and it had the opportunity to support them. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued as for questions. So a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to our GAAP results in our press release. So please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information.\nWith that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We incurred a first quarter net loss that was in line with our expectations, driven by a $380 million pretax negative financial impact related to the December operational disruption, roughly $325 million of that was from lower revenue in January and February, much of that cancellations of holiday return trips. We saw a strong rebound in revenue trends in March, resulting in record first quarter revenues despite the impact of the December disruption.\nTravel demand remained strong thus far, but we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment. You have to be given all the headlines and trends we are seeing across many industries. We have tough year-over-year revenue comparisons here in the second quarter with last year's domestic revenue environment getting a boost from international closures. Taking that into consideration, demand, particularly leisure continues to show strength as we head into the busy summer travel season.\nOur cost outlook is higher this year due to a few moving parts as we are making additional investments in the operation based on our learnings from December. I won't go through all of our key findings and work to shore up our winter preparedness because we've done that a few times now, I am very proud of our people for the operation they have delivered this year and for the relentless focus on executing our plan to fortify the operation in preparation for winter 2023.\nDespite the near-term cost pressures, we have not lost focus on our goal to effectively manage the real inflationary cost increases we are seeing and equally as important, maintain our competitive cost position. As we look ahead, we currently expect solid profits here in Q2. We continue to expect solid profits for full year with a goal to grow full year margins and ROIC year-over-year as well as have our route network roughly restored by year-end.\nWe are reducing our full year 2023 growth plans due to a lower planning assumption for Boeing MAX deliveries this year. This relates to the recent news of further supply chain challenges at Boeing. The outcome is a reduction to our 2023 capacity and CapEx outlook, and we are currently reevaluating our hiring needs relative to our most recent expectation to hire more than 7,000 net new employees this year. We will be moderating our overall hiring plans as we get into the second half of 2023.\nIn the meantime, we are most focused on revisions to our second half 2023 flight schedules to account for fewer aircraft, which Andrew will cover in more detail. I'm very proud of the progress we are making on our customer experience enhancements. As a reminder, we are investing in 3 onboard initiatives, enhanced WiFi, in-seat power and larger overhead bands. In early March, our first new aircraft with hardware from our new WiFi provider, ViaSat, entered Revenue Service.\nBy third quarter, we expect all of our existing aircraft to be flying with upgraded WiFi and Nuvo hardware offering increased speed and reliability. So just great progress on that front. Our new MAX deliveries are coming into service with in-seat power and larger overhead bins. So those are already entering service as well. We're also very focused on mobile and other enhancements on our technology road map to offer more self-service options for our customers to give them more flexibility and ease during their journey. Highlighting one of our stronghold markets, Southwest is the #1 airline in Kansas City, growing from 6 flights in 1982 to 75 flights today. And I'm proud to say that our service in Kansas City is now fully restored the pre-pandemic levels.\nWe recently celebrated the opening of the new Kansas City Airport in February, and we serve as the Chair of the airport and Airlines Affairs Committee. We really appreciated the opportunity to partner with the airport to deliver a beautiful new terminal that will serve us and the community well for a very long period of time. It was a great partnership all the way around, and it is a beautiful facility. We continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people and we continue to make progress. We just reached a tentative agreement with TW-550, which represents our meteorologists, and I want to commend both negotiating committees for the spirit of cooperation that led to that agreement.\nWe remain focused on negotiations with the union representing our ramp in ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants and remain committed to competitive market compensation packages for our people. We are very eager to get new contracts and have a significant amount of wage rate increases and have already been accrued and set aside and we look forward to rewarding those remaining groups soon.\nIn closing, I'm just so very proud of our people. They are the hardest Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And despite the negative impacts in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are carefully managing the business in the near term, and we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and set of initiatives.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone.\nOur first quarter loss is disappointing and not how we hope to start 2023. However, the quarter was not without notable accomplishments. Our on-time performance year-to-date through March was solid. Our operations team navigated through a stream of difficult weather conditions successfully with no material impact to our network performance. And despite the negative revenue impact from the December operational disruption, we still had record first quarter passenger revenues and record other revenue. We also ended the quarter with strong double-digit margins for the month of March despite high fuel prices.\nAll of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance and outlook, so I will jump right in to our cost performance and outlook.\nBeginning with fuels. Our first quarter jet fuel price was $3.19 per gallon, which was on the high end of our guidance range. Throughout first quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, while prices dipped to about $65 per barrel in mid-March, they primarily hovered around $80 per barrel throughout first quarter.\nOn the other hand, refining margins remained volatile during first quarter after hitting a 10-year high last year. Thankfully, market prices have fallen over recent weeks, in particular, crack spreads, which is a welcome release. We are 51% hedged for our second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.55 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.69 lower than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.13 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of roughly $70 million in second quarter alone.\nWe now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.60 to $2.70 per gallon range, down a nickel from our previous guidance and still including $0.10 of hedging gains. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance based on the April 19 forward curve and market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 51% hedged next year as well. We began building our 2025 portfolio and are about 10% hedged.\nThe total market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for second quarter 2023 through 2025 is $419 million. We will continue to see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year.\nMoving to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 5.9% was in line with our guidance range. As expected, we experienced inflationary cost pressures, primarily higher labor costs, including market wage rate accruals for all employee groups as well as increased technology spending and higher rates for airport and benefit costs.\nThe remainder of the increase was primarily driven by operational disruption related expenses. Looking ahead, we currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the 5% to 8% range year-over-year, largely driven by general inflationary cost pressures that we expect to persist and are not unique to Southwest. In addition to higher labor rates, we continue to accrue for market wage rate increases for the remaining open labor contracts.\nAnd as we further refine our multiyear maintenance planning, we have additional maintenance expense this year for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance and this is adding further pressure to our second quarter cost inflation.\nFor full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 3.5% to 5.5%. Approximately 1 point of this year-over-year increase is due to lower capacity as a result of Boeing delivery delays and the remainder of the change in guidance is driven by the timing of maintenance expenses for our -800 fleet, a continuation of what we are experiencing here in the second quarter. As a reminder, our full year CASM-X guidance continues to include higher labor rates, including market wage rate accruals for the remaining open labor contracts as well as the estimated tens of millions of dollars of additional investments we expect to incur towards our operational resiliency.\nTurning to our fleet. We received a total of 30 aircraft deliveries during first quarter as expected ending the quarter with 793 aircraft, which is a net of 7 -700 retirement, 2 more than previously planned as we shifted up a couple of retirements from the second half of this year.\nLooking at the full year, based on the recent production issues at Boeing, we feel it's prudent to have a more conservative planning assumption and are now planning around 70 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared with our previous assumption of approximately 90 -8 deliveries.\nAs a result, we have lowered our full year 2023 capacity guidance by roughly 1 point to up 14% to 15% year-over-year, which impacts our second half capacity assumptions closely and fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have a surplus of underutilized aircraft and our fleet due to pilot hiring constraints. Therefore, the reduction in our delivery should not impact our summer flight schedule. We continue to expect our second quarter capacity to be up 14% year-over-year. Our planned deliveries continue to differ from our contractual order book. In addition to the recent aircraft delivery delays, which are not reflected in our contractual order book, we continue to reflect 46 undelivered 2022 contractual aircraft deliveries as 2023 deliveries in the order book, further outlined in our press release. But to be very clear, we are currently planning our published schedules around the delivery of 70 -8 aircraft this year, and we intend to solidify our order book with Boeing Sam.\nIn regards to our current CapEx outlook for this year, we now estimate to spend approximately $3.5 billion reflecting our updated delivery assumptions of 70 aircraft this year compared with our previous guidance of approximately $4 billion, which assumes roughly 90 aircraft deliveries.\nLastly, a quick note on our balance sheet. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $11.7 billion after paying $59 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in first quarter. We continue to expect a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments for full year 2023, including roughly $10 million in scheduled debt repayments here in second quarter.\nWe also paid $214 million in dividends in the first quarter as our pre-pandemic dividend is fully restored. And based on our current expectations, we continue to expect 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We continue to be in a net cash position, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies.\nIn closing, this was not the first quarter performance we had planned back at Investor Day. However, I am immensely proud of our people and their perseveres. There is still work to be done to fully recover, but we are currently forecasting a substantial improvement sequentially to the bottom line with solid profitability this quarter.\nWe are laser-focused on managing ongoing inflationary cost increases, regaining better operating leverage and maintaining our competitive cost advantage. We have not lost sight of our goals are the warrior spirit of Southwest Airlines, and I'm eager to move forward along our path of success for many years to come.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nSenior VP & CMO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. I'll take a minute to expand on the commentary in our press release this morning and provide more color on our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Our first quarter revenue trends remained steady and within expectations throughout the quarter, with first quarter revenue growth of 21.6% year-over-year. This was right at the midpoint of guidance going back to our January earnings call.\nAnd as a reminder, we had 2 competing storylines in first quarter that played out as we anticipated. First, we incurred an estimated $325 million negative revenue impact that was isolated to January and February. This was the result of cancellations for return holiday travel and a slowdown in bookings following our operational disruptions in late December.\nWe believe these negative revenue impacts have subsided and are now behind us. We saw the reverse over the second half of the quarter and witnessed strong revenue trends throughout March. That showed up in terms of overall demand, rapid reward redemptions and yields. And so even with the negative revenue impact at the beginning of the quarter, we had record first quarter operating revenues of $5.7 billion and record first quarter RASM of $0.15. Managed Business revenues also improved significantly throughout the quarter. And by March, we're nearly restored to March 2019 levels, just shy of 100%. That has tremendous progress, and it feels like we're very close to full corporate revenue recovery at Southwest.\nOur managed business revenues have trended ahead of the industry due to our revenue initiatives in the corporate space, and this is driving new corporate accounts which of course, opens up access to incremental new pools of corporate passengers. And while the managed business recovery still isn't consistent across traveler sector or size of accounts, we expect further sequential improvement in managed business revenues from first quarter to second quarter. How the demand comes in, may be a bit choppy with more volumes further out in the booking curve, but this doesn't seem to be unique in the industry based on ARC data.\nRegardless, we expect to continue making market share gains in the managed business space as we gained another point of market share in first quarter while we expect to grow passenger volume from our initiatives on very solid yields. In terms of the leisure booking curve, it has moved further out from what we saw last summer and fall and seems to have more or less normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Leisure demand and yields, which are well above pre-pandemic levels, continue to be strong heading into summer, and we're currently seeing the sequential improvements in operating revenue and yields that we would expect in the seasonally strong second quarter.\nAll in all, the overall domestic revenue environment remains strong, and our initiatives are performing in line with our expectations. So in short, we're pleased with what we're currently seeing. Our second quarter RASM guidance range of down 8% to 11% contains a 4.5 point year-over-year headwind. As a reminder, second quarter 2022 operating revenues included approximately $300 million of additional breakage revenue, a higher-than-normal amount related to flight credits issued during the pandemic that were soon set to expire as well as our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Adjusting for this headwind, our second quarter RASM guidance would be down around 5%, and we're pleased with the core trends we're seeing.\nThis year-over-year headwind will not persist in the second half of 2023. We're also pleased with the performance of our Rapid Rewards program, co-brand credit card and all ancillary products in first quarter, and we're expecting another strong year-over-year performance in second quarter. We saw a first quarter record of new Rapid Rewards members added to the program and also had a first quarter record of ancillary revenue per passenger.\nAnd finally, our portfolio of new cities, including Hawaii, continue to mature. I'm also proud to announce that we have completed the selection and rollout of our new revenue management system, which is the Amadeus Network revenue management product. Our implementation timing is slightly ahead of our previous timeline of mid-2023 and we're very pleased with the revenue results we saw from Amadeus during the production pilot.\nWe are encouraged about the future opportunity for incremental revenue, which really starts in earnest in third quarter as the new Amadeus product is now fully implemented and is currently managing all future bookings and departure dates. This is just an excellent job by our revenue management team to skillfully manage multiple revenue management systems as we recovered from the pandemic and which ultimately led to this selection. I'm just very proud of the team.\nIn closing, I want to mention that we have watched our brand metrics very closely since the disruption and our scores have improved significantly throughout the first quarter. We are very fortunate to have a loyal customer base at Southwest that we do not take for granted, and we'll continue to communicate to them about our remediation plans and aim to consistently deliver the hospitality, customer service and operational reliability they are accustomed to from us at Southwest.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone.\nI will provide some color on the operation before we jump into Q&A. Following our event in late December, I am proud of the quick rebound we had in early January and the strong operational performance that our employees delivered in Q1. While Q1 was tough weather-wise, our people did a tremendous job quickly recovering from the regular operations. In the days following each event, we had no material hangover in our aircraft or crew networks. We maintained solid operational metrics and completion factor. This is evidence that our processes for irregular operations are solid and working as designed. For the quarter, we finished #2 out of 10 airlines and on-time performance, which reflects well on our people. Most recently, while on April 18, we experienced a double firewall failure that resulted in an unexpected loss of connection to some operational data. While our technology teams worked quickly to resolve the issue that morning, out of abundance of caution, we've temporarily ground [indiscernible] airline. It was a pretty quick fix by the Southwest team and a little more than an hour, we looked at the ground stop more back safely operating flights.\nWhile this type of event drives flight delays across the network, we canceled only 22 flights on April 18. We had no material impact on our operations the following day. Even with the delay of that day, we ran 75% on time within an hour scheduled departure times and 95% within 2 hours. While we don't like those delays, this represents an admiral recovery by our people, all things considered. Regarding our operational disruption remediation plan, Bob covered that in detail at the JPMorgan conference in mid-March, and that presentation is available on the Investor Relations website.\nSince then, we also provide greater detail on the microsite e-mailed our customers with a readout of the key findings and remediation items we want in place by winter 2023. Therefore, I'm not going to walk through it again today. I just want to reiterate that we have a solid plan and our work is on track.\nTurning to capacity. Our lower aircraft delivery expectations this year is driving lower capacity expectations in second half 2023. As a result, our full year 2023 capacity growth is now expected to be in the range of 14% to 15% year-over-year. We're in the process of refining our published flight schedules post summer as we are reevaluating our flight schedule plans are yet to be published November-December flight schedules. We expect to have those schedules published in the next month or so, but our current estimates are that we will trim plane capacity from September through December in the post summer travel period. This now puts us roughly 2 points lower than our original capacity plan for this year, with Q3 being 1 point lower and Q4 being 6 to 7 points lower on a year-over-year basis.\nDespite the lower capacity growth, nearly all of the capacity growth is still going back into key Southwest markets and adding market depth. There was no material change in our capacity allocation approach this year. and we continue to expect to have our route network roughly restored by the end of this year. I want to wrap up by commending the negotiating team of TW 550, who represents our [indiscernible] and it just reached a tend of agreement that will be voted on by our employees soon. We have now come to agreement with 9 of 12 work groups covered by collective bargain agreements.\nWe'll continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups, and we are eager to get these deals wrapped up, so the remainder of our employees can begin receiving the increased compensation we are eager to pay them. We continue to accrue market and competitive wage rates for our employees, which means our financial results and guidance already reflect their estimated raises.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to Ryan Martinez.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder to please keep your questions to 1 and a follow-up if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then leave plenty of room for Q&A. Joining me on the call today is our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ from expectations. Also, we had special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to our press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information.\nAnd with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nCEO, President & Director, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, we're disappointed to report a Q4 net loss as we were on track to produce a healthy fourth quarter profit prior to December 21. We provided an 8-K investor update earlier this month that quantified the preliminary estimate of the financial impacts, so a Q4 loss is likely not a surprise, but I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the operational disruptions.\nAnd first and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and on their holiday plans. We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event, again, like we had last month. And we are highly focused on our customers and our plan going forward, and customer refunds and reimbursements remain a top focus. While I'm not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs.\nWell, in terms of the events themselves, we canceled more than 16,700 flights from December 21 to December 31. The first few days through December 23 were specific to the winter storm, and we began to have additional disruptions in the operation on December 24. As the largest carrier in roughly half of the top 50 U.S. travel markets, we were impacted by rolling storms to an extraordinary degree. We experienced gridlock in many of our largest airports, along with a high frequency of short-notice cancellations, which created urgent and repeating efforts to repair the aircraft routings and then our pilot and flight attendant schedules.\nGiven the overwhelming volume of flight cancellations over multiple days, combined with manual work streams, we determined that the best course of action to get back on track operationally was to reduce our December 27 through December 29 flight activity by roughly 2/3, and that allowed us time to reset the operation to normal flight levels beginning on December 30.\nBut based on what we know at this point, our processes and technology generally worked as designed. But we were hit by an overwhelming volume of close-in cancellations, which put us behind in creating crew solutions, which, in turn, pushed us to manual efforts and solutions, and Andrew will cover that in detail more here in just a minute.\nSo we've got several streams of work underway. Immediately following the disruption, we moved swiftly to put mitigation efforts in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and help fortify our operational resilience. Now we've created an early-indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals an alert if we approach predefined operational thresholds.\nWe established supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to support crew recovery efforts at the first sign of a potential workload backlog. We enhanced our existing tools for crew members to communicate electronically to crew scheduling during irregular operations. And we're in the process of swiftly updating and upgrading our crew recovery tools and systems to solve the backlogged repair of crew member schedules, which was one of the key issues during the disruption.\nWith these short-term risk mitigation steps in place or underway, we're taking additional steps to review the events and determine any additional changes to our plans. We worked early on with our Board of Directors, and they've established an Operations Review Committee that is working with our management to understand the events and help oversee the company's response.\nWe've engaged a third-party global aviation firm, Oliver Wyman, for a third-party assessment of the event and help make recommendations of additional mitigation elements for us to consider, and that work will conclude here over the next several weeks. And with that assessment and our own, we will reassess our 2023 plans, keeping in mind that we already had a robust operational modernization plan in place for 2023. And Andrew will walk you through that in greater detail as well.\nI want to reiterate that Southwest has a very long history of innovation and continuous improvement. We've been investing up to $1 billion per year on technology, both recurring and investment spend included.\nAnd we have implemented numerous large-scale technology and business projects over the past 5 years, including things like the first implementation of the Amadeus reservation system in North America, co-developing and innovative network planning system that's now part of the Amadeus product portfolio; ETOPS certification and processes for Hawaii flying; new aircraft maintenance systems; GDS platform capabilities in connection to 3 other platforms; a new fare product; and automated ancillary services capabilities.\nAnd we're in the process of wrapping up the replacement of our revenue management system, which actually involves 3 RM systems simultaneously in production, which is an absolute technical feat. That list is not meant to be comprehensive, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what we've done and what's underway.\nWe're also currently budgeted to spend $1.3 billion of our 2023 annual operating plan on investments, upgrade and maintenance of our IT systems, which is higher than what we spent in 2022. The recent disruptions will likely accelerate some of our plans to enhance our processes and technology, but I suspect that the operational modernization opportunities that Andrew outlined at Investor Day have largely captured the key work streams, and we will dedicate the capital needed to execute in a timely and efficient manner.\nWe currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans. We were properly staffed for our 2022 flight schedules, including the holidays, and we continue hiring this year to be properly staffed for our 2023 flight schedules. Our plans call for adding over 7,000 new employees in 2023, which is actually a decrease of nearly 40% from 2022 hiring levels. We have the order book from Boeing that we need in 2023.\nAnd with the short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, we believe we are well prepared to execute our network restoration plans this year. Nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets. And that network restoration should significantly help our operational resilience efforts over the long term. Andrew will also cover that in more detail.\nFinally, we continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people. And I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to reach agreements with several of our unions recently, including our flight instructors, our facilities maintenance techs, our customer service agents and, just earlier this week, a tentative agreement with our dispatchers. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our ramp and ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants. And we intend, as always, to have competitive market compensation packages for our people.\nIn closing, we still made tremendous progress in 2022. And despite some impact here in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are holding ourselves accountable to the plans that we outlined at our early December Investor Day, and it is still our goal to achieve the long-term financial targets that we outlined. And I know that our people are up to the task. I'm just extremely proud of them for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines, and they remain absolutely our greatest asset, the heart and soul the company and a tremendous source of pride for me personally.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nCOO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will focus the majority of my comments on the operational disruptions to provide some additional color to what Bob shared. We experienced a historic event with a combination of challenges we hadn't experienced before. However, as Bob mentioned, our crew scheduling software didn't stop working during the disruptions, but a combination of our processes and the technology couldn't keep up with the pace of cancellations at the height of the weather disruption.\nThat forced crew scheduling into fully manual mode to develop solutions, and they simply couldn't keep up with the volume of changes. Based on what we know today, it appears that the last domino to fall was when we could no longer use our automation for crew scheduling. Automation works very well for us, but when a problem gets dated, the automation doesn't have the ability to look backward as it tried to solve future problems.\nTo simplify, the decision support tool helps us solve 2 issues: one, repair the assignments of individual crew members; and two, solve crew coverage problems for individual flights by reassigning crew members and using reserve crew members. If a crew member's individual schedule is not repaired before the next assignment begins, then we aren't able to use the automation to repair the individual schedule.\nConsequently, without updated crew member schedules, the software can't reassign crew members to solve for flights with crew coverage issues. So the disruption uncovered a functional gap in our technology. However, this issue is in the process of being addressed.\nIn terms of the moving parts of our point-to-point network, you can think of it in 3 buckets. You have the flight network, the aircraft network and the crew network. We feel very confident in the flight network and schedules we have published for sale, and we are very adequately staffed to operate our fourth quarter flight schedules. We feel very confident in our aircraft network, and we have a sophisticated technology product that we call the Baker that produces new aircraft solutions during irregular operations.\nAt no time during the disruption did the point-to-point journeys of the aircraft present us with an unsolvable problem. For our crew network, the functional gap that was revealed in our crew scheduling software is in the process of being addressed and should be updated in a matter of weeks, which represents quick work by GE Digital and our teams to address the most notable cause of the event that we are currently aware of.\nSo in terms of where we go from here, if this were to happen again, our actions fall into 3 buckets: immediate mitigation efforts aimed at the last domino to fall; department level assessments and actions; and a systemic review supported by a third party. Bob covered the immediate mitigation efforts implemented, our dashboard, supplemental staffing, crew communication tool enhancements, et cetera. He also covered a third-party review of the events and the Board's involvement in working with management to oversee our response.\nI want to briefly cover the second bucket, which is department actions. Each department has undertaken its own analysis to identify additional measures the departments can make to improve its management of significant disruptions while leaving the cross-departmental improvements to the systemic analysis conducted with a third party.\nSome examples of the department efforts include: implementing a new crew scheduling phone system targeted for Q1 of 2023; create a network disruption pod and NOC, or network operation control center, to better integrate crew data into flight cancellation decisions; increase the number of crew schedulers; evaluate our cold weather preparedness and items such as assessing de-icing procedures, protocols and tools to increase throughput; ensuring we have sufficient ground support equipment fuel that is viable in subzero temperatures.\nThis list isn't meant to be comprehensive either. Just to share with you that we have already identified some smaller scale opportunities for improvement, and we will have taken actions even before we get to the third-party recommendations. But in terms of the review by Oliver Wyman, we think it is a valuable exercise to understand how the accumulation events led us to the final result. And we still want to see if there are opportunities to improve performance on bad weather days to integrate into our modernize the operation efforts.\nWe recently had an opportunity to test some of the new mitigation efforts implemented recently during the FAA technology outage earlier this month with a Notice to Air Missions or NOTAM system. Our NOC worked around the clock in constant contact with the FAA and the industry to make sure that NOTAM info was restored and valid before we pushed any of our flights. We took the time to ensure verification, safety and compliance, which is why we had not dispatched flights before the FAA ground stop, and it is another example that we will not sacrifice safety.\nWe did not sacrifice safety during the December event, the NOTAM event, and we simply won't going forward. Safety is paramount. And we used our new warning indicators. We deployed additional head count to assist crew scheduling, even though we didn't end up needing them. And we executed target cancellations that helped protect how we ended that day to assure a good start the following morning. So while we had a difficult start to that day, thanks to the swift actions taken and enhanced processes in place, we were #1 in the industry in on-time performance the next day.\nPart of the organizational changes, when I stepped into the Chief Operating Officer role, was to combine network planning with the operations functions in order to further align commercial and operations objectives. And we recently announced a related org change by promoting Adam Decaire, former VP, Network Planning, to SVP, Network Planning and Network Operations Control. The goal of this move is to create a tighter feedback loop between schedule design and schedule execution in order to add resiliency and reliability to our network. This is another action that I believe will help us tremendously.\nSince the disruptions in late December, our operational performance has been solid. The month of January has seen several ATC outages, historic precipitation in California, where we are the largest carrier, and multiple snowstorms in Denver. Through Monday, the 23rd, we are #2 in on-time performance out of 10 airlines, trailing American Airlines by less than 1 percentage point.\nAs a reminder of what we shared at Investor Day, I want to recap 2 areas: our operations focus areas and our capacity plan. First, much of what we are talking about in terms of operational improvement and technology upgrades I addressed at our December 7 Investor Day. In particular, in the areas of operating quality and frontline staffing and tools.\nIn the area of operating quality, I noted a focused area called network design recovery. While it was not planned as part of our 2023 delivery, at that point, we had begun work in that area at the time of Investor Day. We had already selected Oliver Wyman to assist us beginning this January. As part of our reevaluation of our 2023 priorities, we'll accelerate this work.\nIn the area of frontline staffing and tools, I noted focus areas of mobility/digital tools and continuous improvement. Again, these weren't specifically slated to deliver by the end of 2023 but will be evaluated again as part of the reassessment of our plans given the challenges with crew communications we experienced.\nI want the third-party review to conclude before I opine on what exactly needs to be done and over what time line, but we have good line of sight to potential improvements in several operations areas that span multiple years, including 2023. Now we need to finalize our plan for 2023 and determine what sequence of improvements are most appropriate in terms of technology and tools investment.\nAnd secondly, our 2023 capacity growth is now up to 16% to 17% year-over-year, but this is apples to apples in line with the old 15% that we outlined in Investor Day. Nothing has materially changed in our capacity plans for this year. The increase is simply due to lower capacity in Q4 2022 due to the flight cancellations. We were headed all along toward network restoration, and the December events had nothing to do with staffing levels or our capacity plans.\nSpeaking to 2023 capacity plans, it is nearly all going back in the key Southwest markets and adding market depth. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansions in the pandemic. And as leisure demand remains strong and business demand improves, we have opportunities to build this back up. And this is lower-risk capacity growth primarily in markets where we have the #1 or #2 share and a strong Southwest Airlines customer base.\nOur goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done. And in doing so, it should help fortify the operation with better itineraries, depth and reaccommodation options for customers, crews and aircraft when we do have weather or delays that create irregular operations. So we plan to continue our investment in the network this year.\nAnd on the topic of 2023 schedules, last month, we extended our flight schedule for sale from July 11 to August 14. This included depth in the Southwest points of strength as well as bringing back longer-haul markets, all part of our continued network restoration and accounts for anticipated travel demand for the peak summer travel period.\nDenver grows at just over 300 flights a day, the highest ever daily total account for any Southwest Airport. And Baltimore hits approximately 220 day departures, which is higher than December 2019. We will peak with total daily flights of nearly 4,400 in July 2023. Our next schedule through October 4 will be published on February 9.\nI want to wrap up by reiterating that we are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating the type of operational event we had last month. And we are also focused on moving forward and running a great operation each and every day. So while there will be lessons learned, we aren't losing focus on the fact on the blocking and tackling that is necessary to efficiently operate our network. I'm confident that our people will continue to do just that, and I'm thankful for their focus on running a safe and reliable operation and providing excellent customer service to our customers.\nFinally, I would be remiss if I didn't commend the negotiating teams of TWU 557, who represents our flight instructors; and AMFA, who represents our facilities maintenance technicians. These negotiating teams worked tirelessly to reach agreements for their memberships, and I am pleased we can reward these employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality-of-life enhancements.\nI'm also pleased that we just recently reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, who represents our flight dispatchers, and they will be voting on their TA soon. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups that await a tandem agreement to vote on, and we intend to continue to pay competitive market compensation packages to our employees.\nSo with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional comments on our 2023 outlook.\nAs a result of the operational disruptions in late December, driving a $620 million negative after-tax net impact, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $226 million, excluding special items. These results are clearly disappointing and not where we expected to be. Our quarterly performance leading up to December 21 was strong and trending in line with our previous guidance expectation aside from CASM-X, which I will cover in a minute.\nAs Bob mentioned, we still made tremendous progress in 2022 despite the operational setback in late December, generating full year 2022 net income of $723 million, excluding special items. Despite the negative revenue impact from the flight cancellations in December, we generated record fourth quarter operating revenues. Ryan will speak to our revenue performance and outlook here shortly, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook.\nBeginning with fuel, our fuel hedge performed well last year, especially in a volatile market environment. In total, our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit was roughly $950 million, with roughly $170 million in fuel expense savings in fourth quarter alone. For 2023, we are 56% hedged in first quarter, 51% hedged in the second quarter and 47% hedged in second half 2023, which equates to 50% hedged for the full year.\nBased on the January 20 forward curve, we now estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, up $0.25 from our previous guidance; and our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3.00 per gallon range, up $0.05 from our previous guidance. Our first quarter guidance includes $0.16 of hedging gains and a hedging premium expense of $0.06 per gallon.\nWe recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 39% hedged, with a fair market value of nearly $561 million in total for 2023 and 2024. We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 with the goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection.\nMoving to our nonfuel cost. We experienced a significant cost increase in fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the December operational disruptions, including a lower capacity from the flight cancellations. The year over 3-year negative impact to fourth quarter CASM, excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, or CASM-X was 23 points.\nIn addition to the impact from lower ASM, the majority of this headwind was driven by the estimated redemption value of Rapid Reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers. There was also premium pay and additional compensation for employees, but that made up a much smaller portion of the 23-point CASM-X impact.\nExcluding the impact from the operational disruptions, our fourth quarter CASM-X was roughly 4 points higher than the high end of our previous guidance range of up 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. This was primarily due to additional labor accruals at year-end.\nAs a reminder, we have been accruing for all open labor contracts since April 1, 2022, and these accruals are dynamic as we continuously evaluate market compensation. Looking forward, we continue to experience year-over-year inflationary cost pressures as well as cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels.\nWe now estimate first quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year, which is approximately 2 points higher than our previous guidance of flat to up 2%. This 2-point increase is due to the continuation of premium pay for a portion of January relating to the December operational disruptions as well as an increase in labor accruals for open contracts.\nFor full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year compared with previous guidance of down 1% to 3%. The vast majority of the change in guidance is related to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 capacity as well as higher fourth quarter 2022 costs attributable to the December 2022 operational disruptions.\nWe have also increased our labor accruals this year, which results in a slight offset year-over-year. Putting aside the effects of the December operational disruptions, we continue to expect our second half 2023 CASM-X trends to improve from first half 2023 year-over-year.\nTurning to our fleet. We ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which is net of 26-700 retirements. We received a total of 68 aircraft deliveries from Boeing, all MAX 8s, which was 2 more than our previous expectation of 66 aircraft. However, we are still short of 46 aircraft from the 114 contractually scheduled 2022 MAX deliveries due to Boeing supply chain challenges and the timing of the -7 certification. These 46 orders are reflected as 2023 deliveries in the order book included in our press release this morning.\nHowever, we don't expect to be caught up on MAX deliveries by the end of this year. We continue to expect 100 MAX-8s this year, which remains our planning assumption. And we continue to expect to retire 27-700 aircraft, which will bring our fleet count to 843 at the end of this year. We have also recently exercised options for delivery in 2024, as outlined in our press release.\nOur full year 2022 CapEx was $3.9 billion, relatively in line with our previous guidance. In regards to our CapEx plans for this year, we continue to estimate spend to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending.\nBob and Andrew touched on our current thoughts regarding technology spend this year in light of the operational disruptions, but I want to reiterate that we are focused on executing our operational modernization plans outlined at Investor Day, which includes our current expectation to spend approximately $1.3 billion this year, including both capital and recurring spend on technology investments, upgrades and system maintenance. And our total CapEx range should allow for additional CapEx investments as needed.\nMoving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion after paying a total of $3.1 billion to retire $2.9 billion in principal of debt and finance lease obligations during 2022. This includes the $1.2 billion principal prepayment of our 2023 notes, which leaves a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments this year. Our leverage is at a very manageable 47%, which we expect to decline over the next several years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies.\nIn closing, I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges. While the last several weeks have been tough, we have not lost sight of the priorities and focus areas that we outlined at Investor Day. In addition to the operational modernization plans we already mentioned, we are eager to wrap up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups.\nAlthough it's disappointing, we expect another loss in first quarter this year due to a carryover revenue drag from the operational disruption. We remain steadfast in our focus to generate consistent quarterly profitability. And even with the first quarter headwinds, our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023.\nFurthermore, we remain determined to achieve our long-term financial targets to grow our profits, margins and returns while delivering on our commitment to provide outstanding customer service and reliable operations that have been a source of tremendous pride over our 51-year history.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan C. Green\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. I'll provide a bit more detail on fourth quarter trends and our revenue outlook for first quarter. First, as Bob mentioned, we are very focused on taking care of our customers impacted by the operational disruptions last month.\nWe've sent gestures of goodwill. We processed all bags for return to customers. We processed nearly all customer refunds and have completed more than 80% of the reimbursement requests we've received from customers for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. We're processing the remaining requests as quickly as possible and plan to have those largely completed by next week. We will continue working hard every day until all requests are resolved.\nTurning to our trends. At our Investor Day in early December, we shared that our fourth quarter revenue outlook remains strong. Leisure revenue trends were strong, both in load factors and yields and for both holiday and nonholiday time periods. Managed business revenues also continue to be strong, and all of that held true right up to the operational disruptions that began on December 21, and we were tracking right in line with our operating revenue guidance to that point. But in the last 10 days of the month, we incurred an estimated $410 million revenue penalty due to the operational disruptions.\nAs the end of December is typically a low demand period for business travel, we experienced less of an impact on business travel trends than with leisure. We still came in at the better end of our managed business revenues fourth quarter guidance range at down 20% compared with fourth quarter of 2019. And despite the $410 million impact, we still generated record fourth quarter revenues of $6.2 billion and a record passenger yield of $0.177.\nWe saw other positive contributors in the fourth quarter from our loyalty program, with fourth quarter records in new co-brand card acquisitions and retail sales. In addition, we benefited from the continuation of increased take rates for upgraded boarding, and our portfolio of new cities and development markets also performed in line with expectations in fourth quarter, absent the event. So in all, there was plenty to be encouraged by in terms of underlying trends in the fourth quarter.\nWe continue to feel good about our 2023 revenue plan. Admittedly, we are starting off first quarter with a $300 million to $350 million headwind, which we assume is attributable to the operational disruptions in December. However, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, and we believe the vast majority of the first quarter impact is isolated to January and February travel.\nFor March 2023, leisure booking and yield trends appear strong and in line with what we would expect from a high-demand travel month. And based on recent improvements in close-in booking trends, we expect March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Beyond that, we expect that our GDS and Southwest business initiatives will provide the opportunity to grow managed business revenues sequentially beyond March.\nSo we are optimistic about both the improving sequential trends we're seeing as well as the early read on March bookings. And based on these trends, we currently expect first quarter operating revenues to increase in the range of 20% to 24% year-over-year. And then finally, while we have limited visibility further out on the booking curve, we continue to see no noticeable signs of a slowdown in macro travel demand and our booking trends.\nOur commercial focus areas and initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day remain unchanged. We continue to focus on driving value from network restoration, new market maturation, Southwest business and GDS, our new fare product, revenue management system modernization and in-flight customer experience enhancements.\nIn closing, I want to acknowledge that we are mindful that we have a few new headwinds in 2023, both on the revenue and the cost side. And as a result, we will continue to work even harder on our revenue plans and revenue generation this year. Ultimately, we need to offset higher costs, and revenue is part of that equation. We still believe there is strong demand ahead of us, and we're encouraged by the revenue trends we currently see in March.\nSo with that, I turn it back over to Ryan Martinez.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, sir. We have analysts queued up for questions. (Operator Instructions) And operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

My name is Jamie, and I'll be moderating today's conference. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to hand the conference over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. In just a moment, we will share some prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on the call today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; President, Mike Van de Ven; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. We also have a few other senior leaders in the room today, including Ryan Green, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ. Also, we had a few special items in our third quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to the press release from this morning in our Investor Relations website for more information.\nAnd with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nCEO & Director, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I'm just really pleased to report another solid profit in the third quarter of $316 million, excluding special items, or $0.50 a share. All in all, third quarter's bottom line results came in almost right in line with our expectations back in July, slightly better, in fact, and that really speaks to the more stable environment that we are operating in today versus where we were just 2 quarters ago. While not fully recovered yet, it makes a big difference in our ability to more effectively plan, set our flight schedules and avoid revising them, and deliver a more reliable operation both for our customers and our employees. That's exactly what we're doing in the second half of 2022, and that's what we plan to do going forward.\nGiven the significant progress we've made thus far, we do not intend to republish or materially change our future flight schedules as was necessary to do during most of the pandemic. One of our primary goals for this year is returning to consistent profitability, and we are well on our way and continue to expect a solid profit for 2022. We are coming off of a record third quarter revenues and bookings appear strong as far as we can see in our booking curve. Demand trends, both volumes and yields, are robust.\nWe want to get properly staffed, and that's going very well. We remain on track with adding over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition, and we are getting much better staffed in key areas, with the exception of pilots, where our aggressive hiring efforts continue. And we are on track to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year as planned.\nWe wanted to restore our operational reliability, and we are headed in the right direction, having made a lot of solid progress. As we shared previously, we restored some of our short-haul flying in the third quarter, which was a little early and at the expense of revenue now knowing where business demand has ended up. But the goal was to help the operation, and I believe we got the desired results in the third quarter.\nGoing forward, we believe we have capacity better matched seasonally to demand in the fourth quarter, and you can see the benefit in our sequential revenue improvement from 3Q to 4Q based on our guidance. And as Mike will cover, our on-time performance this month has been very strong with high completion rates. And the thanks, of course, goes to our people who have solidly restored our customer service advantage this year, another one of our top priorities. For January through August, the most recent data available, we remain #1 in customer service for the DOT's ranking for Marketing Carriers.\nI'm just so thankful for our employees and how they have worked tirelessly together as a team, no matter the obstacle, and they have us solidly back on top of the industry. Again, our employees are the central proof and essence here of Southwest Airlines, and I'm just so very proud of them and all that they have done.\nJet fuel prices remain high, but we are 61% hedged in the fourth quarter and continue to expect healthy hedging gains. We continue to expect both inflationary cost pressures and cost headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency in fourth quarter. This was all anticipated in our full year guidance. And other than some timing of costs between 3Q and 4Q, our cost trends have been very stable. We've been executing well on our full year 2022 cost plan since we provided our full year CASM-X guidance back in January. And but for the Hurricane Ian impact to capacity, we are also executing on our full year 2022 capacity plan.\nSpecific areas of focus for 2023 are to maintain adequate staffing and get caught up in pilot staffing, get new contracts with all labor groups, currently in negotiations, fully utilize our aircraft and optimize staffing to the fleet and flight activity, bring out cost inefficiencies and improve efficiency levels and operating leverage as we fully restore the network.\nOur primary gating factor to growth next year continues to be pilot hiring, and I don't expect that we will be fully utilizing the fleet until late 2023. As of today, our flight schedules are published through July 10, 2023, and we feel good about our ability to fly those schedules as published and planned despite some uncertainty around aircraft deliveries.\nWhile we expect a healthy amount of capacity growth next year, it is nearly all going back into key Southwest markets. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansion during the pandemic. And as business demand improves, we have opportunities to build those back up. And this is lower-risk growth primarily in markets where we have the #1 share and a strong Southwest customer base, so we don't believe the capacity additions carry near the risk of adding a new market. Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done.\nIn closing, we've made tremendous progress this year, barring any significant unforeseen impacts, we should finish this year very strong given our fourth quarter outlook. While there's noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not or whether we may even be in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends. There's also been a lot of discussion about the blending of business and leisure, why and where those trends may ultimately end up. But regardless, our overall revenue trends are strong and well above 2019 levels.\nOur work continues on developing a strong financial plan for next year, and we will share more about that at our upcoming Investor Day meeting in December. And I'm extremely proud of our employees for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines. They're our greatest asset, and they're our secret weapon. They're the best in the business, and I know I can count on them to rally together and help us improve further in 2023.\nAnd before I turn it over to Tammy, I just want to say a big thank you to Mike. Mike has overseen the operations here at Southwest for over 16 years, and that is just a huge job and a huge task. He is a tremendous leader. I'm just very grateful, Mike, for all that you do. And I'm very grateful that you will continue to work as an adviser to me and others in the future.\nAnd I also want to say a big congrats to Andrew, to Linda and to Ryan for taking on even more. I really appreciate that. And today, Mike will report on operations, and Andrew will report on commercial. And then beginning at our December Investor Day, Andrew will speak to operations, and you will hear from Ryan regarding our commercial plans.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob, and thank you, Mike, my very dear friends for 3 decades of incredible leadership. And thanks also to all of our employees for their remarkable job throughout the quarter. In addition to delivering a high-quality experience for our customers, their efforts led to a solid third quarter performance. The strong demand trends from summer continued in third quarter, resulted in record third quarter revenue and record third quarter revenue passengers. Our third quarter operating revenues grew a healthy 10.3% versus 2019, aided by a very strong other revenue performance. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook.\nOur people did another great job managing costs in third quarter. Our fuel hedge continues to perform well in this environment, where market prices remain volatile and elevated, saving the company about $220 million in fuel expense in third quarter alone. We are 61% hedged for fourth quarter, and we currently estimate our fourth quarter fuel price to be in the $3.15 to $3.25 per gallon range, which would be a sequential improvement from third quarter's fuel price based on current prices. That estimate includes $0.37 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of more than $185 million in fourth quarter, which would put our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit at roughly $1 billion.\nWe recently added to our 2023 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 50% hedged, with a fair market value of around $390 million for full year 2023. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio through 2024 is $685 million. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 and beyond, but we are in good shape headed into next year, especially given the volatile energy market over the past year that made it tough to materially expand our positions at historical premium cost.\nTaking a look at nonfuel cost, third quarter CASM, excluding special items and profit sharing, was towards the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 12.2%, compared with third quarter 2019 due to lower-than-anticipated health and benefit costs as well as higher favorable airport settlements that we expected to receive this quarter, but shifted earlier to third quarter.\nWe currently estimate fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels, compounded by decreased capacity levels here in fourth quarter relative to third quarter. The remainder of the CASM-X increase continues to be primarily attributable to inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for labor, benefits and airports.\nAll of that said, I am very pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plans, as Bob mentioned, especially in this environment. As we close out the year, our full year 2022 CASM-X guidance has narrowed to up 14% to 15% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all contract labor groups beginning April 1 of this year, taking into account our best estimate for wage rate increases.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we continue to estimate full year CASM-X to decrease compared with this year. We now have our first half 2023 flight schedules published for sale, and we currently expect first half 2023 CASM-X to be in the range of flat to up 2% compared with first half 2022. Given the level of first half capacity growth, in a pre-pandemic period, we would have expected CASM-X to be subtly down year-over-year. However, we expect to continue experiencing unprecedented cost headwinds due to higher-than-expected inflation. And as part of that, keep in mind that we are accruing for all open labor contracts and further wage rate increases in 2023. So that is fully included in our guidance based on our best estimation of market rates.\nOn top of wage rate inflation, we expect to continue hiring at a healthy pace next year to support 2023 capacity and scale for 2024 growth. Our productivity has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, which has required additional hiring to support the operation. It seems that most industries and companies, including our peers, are experiencing a similar workforce dynamic. Based on our assumption that fleet utilization will be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023, these cost headwinds will persist throughout next year, but should improve somewhat in second half relative to first half 2023.\nWe haven't finalized our second half 2023 capacity plans, but our current estimation is that second half 2023 CASM-X will decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range compared with second half 2022. We continue to be focused on better optimization of staffing levels to our flight activity and improving our efficiency metrics and operating leverage. That work will begin in 2023 and continue into 2024.\nTurning to our fleet. Our planning assumption for Boeing aircraft deliveries this year remains unchanged from what we shared in July. While our contractual order book still reflects 114 aircraft in 2022, we continue to expect 66 -8 MAX deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as uncertainty regarding the timing of the -7 MAX certification. However, we are encouraged to have received all 23 -8 MAX aircraft in the third quarter as expected and continue to expect 31 -8 MAX aircraft deliveries here in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year.\nWe continue ongoing discussions with Boeing and just recently made some modifications to our order book. In short, we converted more -7 MAX aircraft to -8 MAX aircraft in the near term. We outlined the specific changes in our press release this morning, so I won't reiterate all of the fleet details here.\nIn terms of retirements, we now plan to retire a total of 26 -700 aircraft this year, a few less than previously expected, ending the year with an estimated 768 aircraft in our fleet. And our full year 2022 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $4 billion.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $13.7 billion after paying $1.9 billion to retire debt and finance lease obligations during third quarter. This included the full $1.2 billion outstanding amount of our 4.75% notes due 2023 and $184 million in principal of our convertible notes. We have now repurchased a total of $689 million of our convertible notes, roughly 30% of the original issuance, and have $1.6 billion currently outstanding.\nWe remain in a net cash position with leverage at a very manageable 48%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which remains one of our key long-term competitive advantages in good times and in challenging times. With our strong balance sheet and continued financial strength, we will soon discuss our 2023 capital plans with our Board of Directors, but our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have a long-standing dividend history, and reinstating a dividend remains a high priority. We will also continue to look for opportunities to reduce debt. We will continue investing in the company and our people, and we are focused on wrapping up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups.\nLast but not least, and at the right time, we intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation as we have in the past. And all of these intentions assume that the travel demand environment remains steady, and we continue producing consistent quarterly profits. We are mindful of the economy and recessionary risk, and we would like to monitor the environment to see if there is any noticeable impact on travel demand as we move into 2023.\nAgain, we are not seeing any noticeable impact today, but we would like to preserve a higher-than-normal cash balance for some period of time into next year before we materially reduce our cash reserves. So while I can't commit to anything today, I hope that gives you an idea of how we are evaluating our capital allocation choices.\nIn closing, third quarter represented another profitable quarter in our recovery. Our momentum is building here in fourth quarter, supported by a strong revenue outlook, and I am encouraged with the progress we have made as we look to close the year strong and turn our focus to 2023. We are committed to generating healthy returns on invested capital, and I am very pleased with the direction we are headed.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nCOO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our Q3 revenue trends and Q4 outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Overall, Q3 operating revenues came in right in line with the midpoint of our original guidance range, up 10.3% versus Q3 2019. Our path there was a bit different than anticipated, but a solid result nonetheless. We had an 85.4% load factor, and yields increased 5.3% versus Q3 2019.\nIn July and August, we saw a step back in close-end business demand, but that was coupled with stronger advanced purchase leisure demand. In September, we saw a nice sequential improvement in managed business revenues, and leisure demand remained stronger than anticipated and was particularly robust for a typically weaker leisure shoulder month post Labor Day. September managed business revenues finished down 25% versus Q3 2019. So while Q3 took a bit of a step back on business trends, we finished the quarter on a strong note, and revenue momentum is picking up steam.\nAs anticipated, we had a 5-point sequential headwind from Q2 to Q3 for our travel credit expiration policy change in July, which resulted in lower breakage revenue in Q3. As Bob mentioned, we also increased our short-haul flying in Q3 in order to help with our operational stability. Mike will cover operational results in a moment. But we over-indexed some short-haul flying in Q3 relative to where business demand ended up, which created a roughly 2-point drag to Q3 operating revenue. As business demand rebound in September, the additional short-haul flying helped overall revenues, and our revenue trends in medium and long-haul segments were very strong throughout Q3.\nOur Q3 loyalty program revenue was exceptionally strong and the primary driver of the increase in the other revenues. We saw strong growth in retail sales, which was aided by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Even so, Q3 retail sales spend per cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue and EBIT contribution. Our ancillary products also performed well in Q3, in particular, our upgraded boarding product. This allows customers to purchase any unsold business select boarding positions in the A1 to A15 boarding group on the day of travel. We recently rolled out a new digital self-service option to purchase this product, which was previously only available to purchase at the airport gate.\nOur portfolio of new cities and development markets performed in line with expectations in Q3. Hawaii outperformed our expectations, primarily due to stronger Mainland to Hawaii performance as we further invested in and re-optimized our Hawaii franchise. And these actions are paying off. Our Hawaii interisland service will take longer to development, and our primary goal at this point is generating awareness among local travelers and incentivize them to try Southwest and experience our product. This is not uncommon with introduction of new service.\nNow looking at Q4, travel demand is strengthening, and we expect both leisure and business revenue trends to improve sequentially from Q3, and bookings for the holidays are strong. We expect Q4 operating revenues to increase in the range of 13% to 17% versus Q4 2019. We expect sequential improvement in Q4 business revenue trends compared with September is down 25%, and we expect Q4 managed business revenues to be down 20% to 25% versus Q4 2019. The sequential improvement we are seeing in operating revenues is from base business improvement, in particular on the yield side, as we continue -- as well as continued ramp of benefits from revenue initiatives.\nOur Q3 capacity decreased slightly, down 0.3% versus Q3 2019, which was in line with our guidance, despite flight cancelations from Hurricane Ian. Our Q4 capacity is a little lower than previously guided due to Hurricane Ian flight cancellations and is now expected to be down approximately 2% versus Q4 2019. Stage length is increasing a bit as we move through Q4, and we continue to expect to be about 85% restored from a network perspective by this December.\nLooking ahead to next year, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase around 10% year-over-year and Q2 2023 capacity to increase around 14% year-over-year. While we aren't ready to provide full year '23 capacity guidance yet, that should give you an idea of the rate of capacity growth next year. When we talk about being fully restored from a network perspective, that means restoring the key Southwest markets that we borrowed from to fund the new airport growth during the pandemic. So our year-end 2023 capacity goal would be network restoration plus our 18 new airports and recent Hawaii expansion.\nIn closing, this will be my last earnings call covering the commercial update as our new Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, will take over going forward. I've worked with Ryan for a long time, and he's very prepared and well qualified for his expanded role. Some of you have met Ryan in the past, but he was most recently our Chief Marketing Officer. As I'm transitioning to Chief Operating Officer, I will retain the network planning function as we strive to increase operating leverage as we move past the pandemic and reconstruct the network. And being conscious that I'm standing on his shoulders for my new job, I thank you, Mike, and turn it over to you.\n\nMichael G. Van de Ven\n\nPresident, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We're now through the busy summer travel season. And aside from some weather that the industry had to deal with, I am very pleased with the reliability of the operations that our employees delivered in the third quarter. They're working very hard to take great care of each other and our customers. And we've made tremendous progress in several areas, including getting properly staffed in most workgroups, and we have more employees that have completed their initial training, and they're now contributing on the front line. So over 95% of our hiring has been in frontline and operations groups.\nSecond, flying our published schedules without making material [posting] revisions. As Bob mentioned, our third quarter schedules were much more stable for our employees and our customers. And third, just as with last quarter, we have improved the quality of the schedule with more depth and more nonstop flights. Andrew mentioned we've added short-haul flights in business or in markets, and that provides more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We also have more flying between all of our crew bases, and all of those changes support a more stable operational performance.\nFrom Memorial Day through Labor Day, the heavy summer travel season, we improved year-over-year across nearly every operational metric, including our on-time performance. And our flight completion rate was 98.6%, which means we canceled slightly more than 1% of our scheduled flight, and that's in line with our pre-pandemic performance, and that's really where we aim to be. Digging into on-time performance for the third quarter, our on-time performance was 71.2%, which was referred to as A14 by the Department of Transportation or getting customers to their destination within 14 minutes of their scheduled arrival time.\nSo if you look at getting our customers to their destination within 30 minutes, our on-time performance increased to 81.7%, and it was 90.4% within an hour. Well, we always want to be on time, but my point is, is that we are currently canceling very few flights, and we're consistently getting the vast majority of our customers to their destinations within a reasonable amount of time. We are focused on improving our A14, and we know that the primary challenge is operating tempo.\nAnd I talked about this last quarter, but I think it's worth repeating. Our operating tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires starting work. We've got more leisure customers that are in our load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from both weather and staffing. And all of these things tend to require more time and are causing us some delays that just didn't exist pre-pandemic. However, we have made solid progress towards our historical operational results, and we're doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels.\nWe aim to continue improving. We've got great momentum here in October with our on-time performance running in the low 80% range. We continue to hire and train new employees. And that should have us well prepared for the upcoming holiday season, and we should continue just to get better as we continue our network restoration through next year and get even more employees through training.\nAnd just a couple of more thoughts on hiring and training. We continue to hire in most workgroups and focus locations, and we still expect to add over 10,000 employees this year net of attrition. We just -- we aren't just hiring for this year, though, we're hiring to support the spring and the summer of 2023 so that we have a more seasoned workforce in place. Our pilot hiring and training continues to be the pacing factor for growth as we move forward. We continue to attract high-quality pilot candidates, and the training program to onboard a new pilot to Southwest Airlines are robust. We're operating at our maximum training capacity for pilots, and that will continue well into 2023.\nAnd then just last, but certainly not least, I do want to congratulate my friend, Andrew Watterson, for his new role as Chief Operating Officer. I've been doing that role for almost 17 years, and I know Andrew is well prepared to take on this role. I know he's going to continue driving to modernize the operation. He's going to bring a new perspective and energy that will serve our company well. And I'm looking forward to transitioning into an executive adviser role early next year and assisting Bob and the Southwest team on a variety of matters as needed.\nI would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. I especially want to say thank you to the entire operations team that I've been a part of and have had the pleasure to support all these years. Southwest is truly a championship team, and I am grateful that I will continue to be a part of it.\nSo with that, Ryan, I will turn it back over to you.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Mike. We have analysts queued up for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you all for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In just a moment, we will share some prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And with me today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations.\nAlso, we had a few special items in our second quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference our non-GAAP results as well. So please refer to our press release from this morning in our Investor Relations website for more information.\nAnd with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nCEO & Director, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, what a difference a quarter can make. Coming off first quarter's net loss, you will recall that we are encouraged by the positive trend change in travel demand in March, and we're optimistic about summer travel revenues. That said, I don't think any of us expected demand to surge to the levels we experienced in the second quarter, particularly in June.\nAndrew will cover the revenue details, but Q2 operating revenues increased 13.9% versus Q2 2019 to an all-time quarterly record of $6.7 billion despite Q2 managed business revenue still down 24% and capacity that was still down about 7%. We also produced an all-time record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million. It is all because of the people at Southwest Airlines, and I want to just say a huge thank you to them for a job very well done. I want to congratulate them on the progress that we've made together. It's just an incredible turnaround from last year, not to mention just a quarter ago.\nLooking forward, demand continues to be strong. We continue to experience both inflationary pressures and headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency. Energy prices have moderated a bit recently, but remain high, and we expect to have another meaningful fuel hedging gain here in Q3. But most importantly, we remain largely on our plan for this year.\nOur 2022 capacity remains stable. We remain on our cost plan. We're slightly ahead of our overall staffing plan, and our operational reliability is much improved. We've made tremendous progress, and our people have a lot to be proud of. I'm just extremely thankful for all of their efforts in getting us to this point in the pandemic recovery.\nOur third quarter guidance is based on our current outlook and excludes any significant unforeseen events, but I'll admit that there's a lot of noise out there right now. It seems that all of us know someone who has this latest strand of COVID, inflation pressures are real, and there are worries about a potential recession. Consumer and business sentiment is down, and there are data points out there that could indicate early signs of a slowdown.\nBut so far, demand remains strong, and we haven't seen material impacts to our business. As always, we'll continue to monitor the environment and be ready to respond if needed. It's helpful to remember that we have historically lagged in terms of impact to revenues going into a recession, and we have typically lagged recovery coming out.\nWell, you've heard me mention our list of key priorities for 2022 many times, I'd like to share our midyear progress on each of them. First, getting properly staffed at focusing on our people. I'm really proud to report that we reached pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022, which is just a huge milestone. We continue hiring in specific areas, particularly for pilots, and we expect to add over 10,000 employees this year out of attrition.\nWe're pleased to be seeing the impact of our hiring in airports, especially given the busy travel season that we're in. Now that thousands of new employees have been due training and are contributing on the front line. Second, making progress towards our historic operational reliability and efficiency. Our operational performance since April has been very strong, and our flight cancellations in May and June were less than 1%, which means a 99-plus percent completion factor.\nMike will cover the operations in more detail, but we are benefiting from getting better staffed, getting new employees through training and on the front line, adding more short-haul flying to provide better network stability and adding more flying between crew bases. We know that we've got work to do on the efficiency side as we focus on 2023, and we're laser-focused on walking down fleet and capacity plans, moderating our overall hiring, optimizing staffing to flight schedules, ringing out cost inefficiencies and returning to our historic efficiency levels by the end of next year.\nBut again, I just want to thank our amazing people for their hard work as we continue to improve our operational reliability. And I want to thank our partners at the FAA and in the administration for working to overcome challenges and continuing to improve the airspace as travel demand returns.\nThird, providing legendary hospitality. I'm very proud of our people and our employees for restoring our customer service advantage this year. For January through May, we are #1 in customer service per the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I continue to be out in the field on a regular basis, and I get to experience firsthand, our terrific employees taking great care of our customers.\nI get the e-mails, I see the stories, and I truly appreciate what they all do each and every day for our customers and for each other. I'm also very pleased to announce that we continue to make traveling on Southwest Airlines even easier by adding yet another customer benefit, our new flight credits don't expire policy. It's an industry-leading flight credit policy. And when you combine that with no change fees, no bag fees, Rapid Rewards points that don't expire and transferable flight credits, it's just a powerful low-fare brand combo that's all about winning more customers. While there is a cost, it's really the onetime cost of extending the COVID-related funds that would have expired this September and we expect the impact to be immaterial beyond this quarter.\nAnd finally, returning to consistent profitability. We just reported record earnings for Q2, and this is the most stable revenue environment that we've had in over 2 years. We remain well protected with our fuel hedge, and we are currently expecting to be profitable for Q3 and Q4 and for the full year 2022. Our main gating factor to future growth is pilot hiring. Despite delays in aircraft deliveries, we feel good about our ability to fly our flight schedules as planned, which are currently published through March 8. Our current outlook for first quarter 2023 is for capacity to be up about 10% versus first quarter 2022. And if we find ourselves in a position to need to republish schedules or trim capacity, we can certainly do that, but I'm optimistic that we can continue to avoid that going forward.\nIt is still very early for 2023. So we're just going to take it one quarter at a time beyond our currently published schedules. But we're turning our focus to 2023 planning and, in particular, regaining historic efficiency levels, and we'll share our 2023 outlook with you at Investor Day, which is currently planned for December 7.\nLast, I just want to stop and acknowledge the assailant incident event that we had at Love Field earlier this week. Luckily, all of our employees and customers are safe. And I just want to say a huge thank you to our employees for taking great care of our customers and each other. I want to thank law enforcement for their swift and professional action. Thank the TSA for managing the fault out. And just thank you to everybody involved for keeping this from being worse. I'm just very, very grateful for that.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this quarter, which resulted in solid operational and record financial performance. The demand surge, coupled with constrained capacity, resulted in a strong yield environment and record quarterly operating revenues of $6.7 billion. The record revenue performance drove record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million despite higher fuel and inflationary cost pressures. We have also posted a strong operating margin, excluding special items, of 17.4%, which exceeded second quarter 2019 levels. All around, this was an impressive quarter and an important milestone along our pandemic recovery.\nAndrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, including why we made the policy change regarding flight credits that don't expire, but I want to make a few comments regarding the timing of revenue recognition for breakage revenue for tickets expected to go unused. The pandemic caused an extremely high number of customer flight cancellations during 2020, and to a lesser degree, last year and even the beginning of this year with Omicron wave. As a result, we have had more flight credits outstanding than normal. Today's policy change to eliminate the expiration dates for unused funds will result in lower breakage revenue for third quarter than we would record under our previous policy in large part due to the COVID-related travel funds that were set to expire in September. Andrew will cover the sequential impact to revenue in a minute, but we expect the policy change to result in significantly lower breakage revenue in third quarter, which we factored into our third quarter revenue guidance.\nWe currently expect that impact to be in the $250 million to $300 million range. As we look beyond third quarter, we expect breakage as a percentage of revenue to normalize back to pre-pandemic levels and any ongoing impact from this policy change is estimated to be immaterial beyond this quarter. Our people did a great job, managing costs in second quarter and our fuel hedge performed very well. While market prices have moderated a bit lately, they are still elevated, and volatile given the current geopolitical climate. Regardless of the continued uncertainty surrounding the market, our fuel hedge significantly offset the market price increase in jet fuel in second quarter 2022, saving us $330 million in fuel expense.\nWe are 59% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, slightly below our second quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.46 of hedging gains, which represents cost savings of more than $230 million in third quarter alone.\nOf course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and jet fuel cracks can move materially on a daily basis. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our 2023 and 2024 portfolio. The fair market value of our fuel hedge for the second half of this year is approximately $430 million, which would bring our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit to roughly $1 billion based on price assumptions outlined in our earnings release, and the fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2023 and beyond is estimated at roughly $580 million.\nTaking a look at nonfuel costs, second quarter CASM-X was favorable to our previous guidance range at up 13.1% compared with second quarter 2019 and due to lower-than-anticipated benefit cost and the shifting of some maintenance costs into the second half of this year. For our third quarter, we currently estimate nonfuel CASM-X to increase in the range of 12% to 15% when compared with 2019 levels.\nMore than half of that increase continues to be driven by inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for our labor benefits and airports. The remainder of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as we continue to work to get adequately staffed and our new employees trained while third quarter capacity levels are expected to be roughly in line with 2019 levels.\nOverall, I am pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, especially in this environment, and our full year CASM-X guidance remains unchanged at 12% to 16% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all work groups beginning April 1, taking into account our best estimate in this labor environment.\nTurning to our fleet. We have revised our expectations for aircraft deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as the current status of the -7 MAX certification. Through the first half of this year, we took delivery of 12-8 MAX aircraft, and we now expect to take delivery of 23 aircraft in the third quarter and 31 aircraft in fourth quarter. All -8 MAX aircraft for a total of 66 deliveries this year.\nWe do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We plan to retire a total of 29-700 aircraft this year and currently estimate will end the year with 765 aircraft in our fleet which supports our currently published flight schedules through March 8 of next year. We have additional information in our press release, so I won't reiterate all the fleet details. You will see that our contractual order book still reflects 114 MAX deliveries, including options this year, but we are providing you our best estimate for what we think we will receive this year based on recent discussions with Boeing.\nWe will continue working with Boeing with the focus on this year and next. Based on our updated planning assumption that we will receive a total of 66-8 MAX aircraft this year, we have lowered our 2022 CapEx guidance to approximately $4 billion, $1 billion lower than our previous guidance that assumed the delivery of 114 MAX aircraft.\nOn our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $16.4 billion. We also recently extended our $1 billion revolving line of credit by 2 years with no change to our covenants, and it remains undrawn and fully available to us. We are in a net cash position and leverage is at a very manageable 53%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages.\nWe have modest scheduled debt payments for the remainder of this year. However, we have been opportunistic and have repurchased some of our convertible notes, $302 million so far this year and $505 million in total with $1.8 billion still outstanding. As a reminder, the payroll support restrictions on dividends and share repurchases remain in place until the end of this quarter. As always, we will be evaluating our capital plans with our board as we began planning for 2023.\nThroughout the pandemic, we've been surgical in our capital allocation decisions to drive future growth and value. And in terms of priority, as we move forward, we intend to continue investing in the business as we scale for future growth. We will continue paying down debt, and we will continue to be opportunistic where we can, and we may have opportunities to reduce our leverage at a faster pace. As ever, we are committed to generating returns on capital, well in excess of our cost of capital and intend to outline our future capital plans at our Investor Day later this year. So more to come on that.\nIn closing, I am very pleased with our second quarter results. As Bob mentioned, we remain on track with our plans this year, have better stability and have good momentum heading into the second half of this year. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue trends and Q3 outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q2, we experienced a significant change in revenue trends compared to Q1 as travel demand began to surge in March. Each month in Q2 was stronger than the prior in terms of load factor yield and revenue. June represented the strongest monthly revenue performance in our history, and we had all-time quarterly record operating revenues in Q2 of $6.7 billion, which was up 13.9% versus Q2 2019, in line with our guidance.\nLeisure demand was robust, and we also saw a notable improvement in business demand. Managed business revenues improved from down 36% in March to down 19% in June. While business passengers and overall managed business revenues remain below 2019 levels, managed business fares were above 2019 throughout Q2. Our Q2 loyalty program revenue also represented an all-time quarterly record, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase, that we secured at the end of last year.\nQ2 retail sales, spend per cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue contribution. Our new cities and development markets performed well, as did Hawaii, which was aided by the modifications we made to our Hawaii flight schedule and Mainland flying.\nOur revenue initiatives also performed well, and we launched our new fare product Wanna Get Away Plus in May. I want to congratulate our teams on a successful rollout and customers are responding well to our expanded fare offerings. All told, Q2 was strong across all geographies and metrics, and we were very pleased with the results.\nAs you saw in our release this morning, beginning today, any flight credit that results from a flight change or cancellation, no longer will expire in the future. Previously, Southwest flight credits had to be flown within 1 year from the date our customers originally purchased their ticket. We also are eliminating the expiration date on any flight credits that are currently valid and unexpired, including those travel credits that were issued as customers changed their travel early in the pandemic and would have expired this coming September.\nWe're famous for offering industry-leading flexibility across the board, and customers tell us it is one of the key differentiators of our brand. Repeat purchases by engaged customers is a cornerstone of our business model and our success. Our customer research and feedback tells us that flexibility has become even more important to customers over the past 2 years. Therefore, it's important to us to deepen our commitment to flexibility and the ease of doing business with Southwest Airlines. And with this move, we are clearly the industry leader and unmatched in this regard. The value proposition for our customers is greater than it has ever been.\nNow looking at Q3, we're coming off of June's peak performance, but current demand trends remain strong. We continue to experience strong passenger bookings yields and load factors. Leisure bookings are trending in line with seasonal expectations. Business demand is also trending well, and we expect Q3 business -- managed business revenues to improve the down 17% to 21% compared with Q3 2019. July is the second weakest month for business travel, and August is a mix of leisure and business as leisure summer demand seasonally cools off in the back half of the month. If we look at post-Labor Day bookings on hand at this point, we're encouraged by both leisure and business bookings, although it's still pretty early in the booking curve, especially for business travel.\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention that there are quantitative anecdotes from external data that indicate industry yields are softening off of the peak of June, and we are watching our bookings very closely. That said, we are overall pleased with the trends we are currently seeing and expect Q3 operating revenues to increase 8% to 12% versus Q3 2019. Included in our Q3 guidance are two headwinds and as we look at sequential revenue expectations compared with Q2.\nFirst, we have a 5-point sequential headwind due to our policy change to remove expiration dates from our flight credits, which Tammy mentioned is a onetime impact. And secondly, we have a 2-point headwind due to our network restoration with focus on short-haul markets in Q3. Our network restoration is important to getting back to full utilization of our assets but is already providing benefits in terms of operational reliability. And we believe this revenue headwind is temporary until business demand recovers more fully.\nOur Q3 capacity is roughly flat with Q3 2019, and our Q4 capacity is expected to be down 1% to 2% versus Q4 2019. Our flight schedule is currently published through March 8. And based on current plans, January and February 2023 capacity is flat to January and February 2019.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase 10% versus Q1 2022. We are still early in our 2023 planning process, but that gives you an idea of where we expect to begin the year in terms of capacity. In terms of network restoration and based on our full year 2022 capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we continue to expect to be roughly 85% restored by the end of this year. While capacity levels are in line with 2019 in the second half of this year, our network won't be fully restored until at least the end of 2023 as we continue to rebuild the vast majority of flights we cut during the pandemic to fund new city growth.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael G. Van de Ven\n\nCOO & President, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We are in the middle of the busiest summer travel season we've experienced in several years, and we're making significant progress in delivering a stable and reliable travel experience to our customers and to our employees. Our hiring momentum began to build in the first quarter, and that's continuing. Those additional employees are beginning to impact our day-to-day operating environment as they complete their initial training and move into their respective roles.\nOur new hires, combined with the scheduled reductions that we made earlier in the year as well as our ongoing operational modernization efforts, have stabilized the operation as we continue forward. From the beginning of May through the busy 4th of July travel period that I know you all heard about on the news, our cancellation rate was less than 1%, and that's the best performance for Southwest since 2017. Our on-time performance over that same period, as measured by the DOT, was 74.3%. And while that is certainly below our expectation, it's primarily an operating tempo problem.\nOur tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires just starting work, heavy load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from weather and staffing. If on-time performance was measured within 30 minutes, that 74.3% would improve to 85.3%, and that's in line with our historic pre-pandemic levels. So in practical terms, that means that in today's environment, almost 90% of our nearly 4,000 flights a day are operating just like they were pre-pandemic, but about 10% of the flights have a 15-minute delay that wasn't there in pre-pandemic periods.\nSo we've made solid progress towards historical operating results, and we're doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We've accomplished all of that by balancing our flight schedules with staffing. Our staffing -- our active staffing is up over 7,000 employees since the end of last year, and we surpassed 2019 levels of active staffing in May. About 75% of this hiring was in our airport operations and about 20% were in flight crews.\nWe're going to continue hiring. It's imperative that we remain adequately staffed to support both our customers and our employees. We're focused on improving the experience of our flight crews in terms of reroutes and deadheads and any unplanned overnight and extra flying. And finally, we've improved the quality of the schedule for our operation with more depth and more nonstop flights. We've added short-haul flights in the business-oriented markets. That provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. And we also had more flying between our crew bases. And all of those things and all of those changes support a more stable operational environment.\nAs we continue our network restoration, I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve. I believe that those improvements, combined with our other operational initiatives, are going to provide the foundation to recapture our overall efficiency and return to historic levels of productivity.\nAnd just a couple more thoughts on hiring and training. As travel demand began to rebound last year, our first step was to rebuild and restart our hiring machine, and we had staffing shortages and bottlenecks throughout the organization from recruiters to the front line to supporting positions. We've been running at a record pace this year. And from a company-wide perspective, we've augmented our staffing in most of the critical areas, and that's leaving just our pilot hiring and training as the pacing factor for the company as we move forward. So as Bob mentioned, we still expect to add over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we're now at a point where we can begin to transition those hiring efforts into more targeted and focused locations and groups where our network restoration has occurred. The majority of these hires will be to cover our published schedules and capacity plans this year, but we also intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future, and then get ahead of our spring and summer of 2023 staffing needs with a more seasoned workforce.\nWe're still being impacted by COVID illnesses and a higher level of inactive employees. Our sick rates are still elevated in some of our work groups. So we believe that it's just prudent to build some staffing cushion and buffer in the aviation environment that we all find ourselves in. And none of that is unique to Southwest. It's a work in progress and getting back to historical levels of productivity by the end of next year remains 1 of our top priorities.\nSo on a separate note, I wasn't able to be at our grand opening of our new 130,000 square foot aircraft maintenance hangar in Denver during the second quarter, and that's going to be very helpful to the operation. With the addition of Denver, we now have 7 Hanger locations: Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando and now Denver. Our tech up team does a tremendous job, and I want to thank them for managing through a changing flight schedule in a fleet plan over the past several years.\nAnd last, but certainly not least, our people have solidly restored our customer service advantage. Year-to-date through May, Southwest is back in the top spot for customer satisfaction for the DOT's air travel consumer report and my sincere thanks to all of our employees, especially all those on the front line that are taking care of our customers and of each other. They are simply the best, and I have my deepest respect and admiration.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Mike. We have analysts queued up for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. Joining me on the call today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Van de Ven.\nA quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. Also, we had a few special items in our first quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference these non-GAAP results in our remarks. Please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information, our cautionary statements and our non-GAAP reconciliation for more detail.\nWith that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nCEO & Director, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, Ryan. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Well, the first quarter was a tale of 2 really different environments. As expected, we incurred losses in January and February due to the negative impacts of the Omicron variant. We anticipated travel demand would rebound in March, and we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it bounced back and the extent to which demand and bookings surged. While we reported a Q1 loss, we were solidly profitable in March, actually not too far off of March 2019's profit. And while modest, I'm very pleased that first quarter unit revenues increased as compared to 2019. That was the first quarterly increase since the onset of the pandemic.\nSo -- but for the Omicron impact, we estimate that we would have been profitable for the first quarter. In the first quarter, total operating revenues were 91% restored to 2019 levels despite Q1 managed business revenues being only 45% restored. Looking forward, we are very encouraged with the bookings and revenue trends we are experiencing for Q2, which indicate operating revenues will be fully restored to quarterly record levels on stronger leisure and business demand.\nOur revenue initiatives continue to roll out, and Andrew will cover our new fare product in more detail, and we look forward to launching that this quarter and getting another one of our revenue initiatives in place and producing value.\nWe will have another meaningful fuel hedge gain in Q2, and we remain well protected with our fuel hedge portfolio in the second half of this year. Despite higher-than-normal unit cost inflation and productivity drags from underutilizing our assets, we expect to be solidly profitable for Q2 through Q4 and for the full year 2022. We are currently forecasting a healthy profit for Q2 with solid operating margins. Now of course, this is based on our current outlook and barring any unforeseen material events such as another wave that would impact or temporarily slow our progress, but we see no signs of that at this point. It just goes to show the power of our business model and how well our people are managing through a very difficult environment.\nOur March results and our current outlook for Q2 represent tremendous progress in our recovery. Even if we aren't fully expected to be optimized with our network fully restored until the end of next year, I'm just really, really proud of our people for their progress today. We've come a long way. I'm just very thankful for their constant resilience.\nNow key to our recovery is our continued hiring progress, and we now plan to hire and add over 10,000 new employees to the Southwest family this year, and that's net of expected attrition. By the end of this month, we will have welcomed roughly 6,500 new employees in 2022, and that's 5,000 net of attrition. And I'm just really pleased with our hiring progress. We continue to work through lower available staffing and training constraints to keep pace with rebounding travel demand, and we recently reduced our summer flight schedules to match our capacity guidance as we prioritize our operational reliability.\nI believe we have already accounted for the impact of staffing constraints in our full year 2022 guidance on capacity of down 4% versus 2019. But of course, we need to trim more capacity we certainly can, but I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get to a good balance of headcount to operate our planned flight schedules for the remainder of the year while setting ourselves up for resuming more material growth in 2023.\nYou've heard me mention these things before, but we remain focused on a few key priorities for this year: first, getting properly staffed and focusing on our people; second, making progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency; third, providing our legendary hospitality; and fourth, returning to consistent profitability. It will take all 59,000 employees working together to execute on these focus areas and deliver a low-cost, high-quality product with low fares and great customer service. That's what our people are good at, and they've been good at that for 50 years, and they just do an incredible job.\nIt's a tough environment, and they've been through a lot. I'm so grateful for them and what they do each and every day. Together, we're making tremendous progress to put this pandemic behind us. And while coming out of the pandemic has proven to be messy. As it was coming into the pandemic, I can assure you that we are very hard at work here at Southwest Airlines to make this company even stronger, and I remain very optimistic about our future.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their resilience in yet another challenging quarter impacted by the pandemic and weather disruptions. The rapid rise of the Omicron variant significantly impacted our business in January and February, resulting in a first quarter net loss of $191 million, excluding special items. March, however, was a much different story as we experienced a rebound in demand and surge in bookings during the month, driving March operating revenues higher in March 2019. This was our first monthly revenue increase relative to respective 2019 levels since the pandemic began.\nLast month, cash sales also represented a monthly record as bookings surged for spring and summer travel. And we posted healthy double-digit margins for the month of March despite the significant rise in market jet fuel prices. Needless to say, I am excited about the strong revenue trends in second quarter, as Andrew will cover in more detail in a minute.\nTaking a look at nonfuel cost, we are tracking in line with our 2022 cost plan with first quarter CASM-X coming in at the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 17.9% compared with first quarter 2019. Thankfully, favorable airport settlements, better operational performance in March and lower-than-expected incentive pay created some end period cost relief in first quarter relative to our guidance.\nAs we look ahead, we continue to experience unit cost pressure from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as well as higher inflationary cost pressures, primarily in salaries, wages and benefits. We are leaving our full year CASM-X guidance unchanged at up 12% to 16% versus 2019 as we are still not able to fully utilize our assets or achieve optimal productivity levels due primarily to staffing challenges. That said, we do expect second half 2022 CASM-X growth rate relative to 2019 to ease sequentially from first half 2022.\nFor our second quarter, we currently estimate CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% when compared with 2019 levels. Roughly half of that increase is a result of continued inflationary pressures in both labor and airport rates, which now includes labor rate increases across all work groups as best as we can estimate at this point given the current labor market and our current outlook for profitability this year. We estimate the incremental labor accruals to be roughly 1 point to CASM-X. The remaining half of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal capacity and productivity levels.\nOur outlook for second quarter capacity remains down approximately 7% from 2019 levels. And while our moderated capacity plans are designed to provide operational relief given our current available staffing challenges, it continues to create unit cost headwinds, particularly with a shorter stage length as we add back higher-frequency business routes, which Andrew will speak to shortly.\nTurning to fuel. Market prices have been on a rise and highly volatile given the current geopolitical climate. Our fuel hedge is providing excellent protection against rising energy prices and significantly offsets the market price increase in jet fuel in first quarter 2022. We are at 63% hedged for second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $3.05 to $3.15 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.80 higher than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.61 of hedging gain, which represents cost savings of more than $290 million in second quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and heating cracks have been moving pretty materially on a daily basis.\nBy the way, the current energy environment is exactly why we hedge fuel. Even though the hedging gains in the second quarter won't fully offset the rise in market fuel costs, our hedging portfolio is providing meaningful cost mitigation. The fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2022 is estimated at roughly $1 billion.\nTurning to our fleet. We recently adjusted our order book with Boeing to replace the majority of our -7 MAX firm orders with -8 MAX firm orders in the short term, along with other adjustments, which we outlined in our earnings release this morning. I won't reiterate all the details, but will note a few key highlights. Our current order book now reflects 21 -7 firm orders, 81 -8 firm orders and 12 remaining MAX options in 2022. If you recall from our previous order book as of the end of last year, we had no -8 firm orders in 2022. While we are eager to bring the -7 aircraft into our fleet and remain confident in the aircraft, we simply wanted to go ahead and rebound our 2022 order book to provide more near-term certainty given the ongoing certification process for the -7. We are grateful for the flexibility we have in our order book to shift between -7 and -8 and our plans this year to take 114 aircraft delivery and retire 28 -700 remain unchanged.\nWhile our CapEx guidance assumes we will exercise the remaining 12 options this year, we maintain flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise each month. And given that the certification for the -7 has been going on for some time, we contemplated the possibility of taking some -8s this year into our 2022 CapEx estimate. Therefore, our CapEx guidance of approximately $5 billion remains unchanged.\nAs I have mentioned before, we don't expect to incur a CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft versus accelerating -700 retirement while our capacity remains temporarily moderated. So from an economic standpoint, we may not decide to accelerate further aircraft retirements this year despite having more aircraft in our fleet than needed for current 2022 capacity plans. We are also mindful of aircraft and growth needs for 2023 as we plan to continue restoring the network.\nOn our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $15.7 billion. Our leverage is at a very manageable 56%, and we continue to pay down and retire debt as opportunities arise as we have done with a portion of our convertible debt. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages.\nIn closing, our second quarter financial trends are strong. Barring any unforeseen events or trend changes, we expect solid second quarter profit and operating margins. Our financial position and ample liquidity allows us to continue investing for the future so that we are ready to resume growth as soon as we are first able to restore our network and get staffing to desired levels. And we intend to grow. We are a growth airline. We have great momentum, and we are excited about the ample opportunities in front of us.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Tammy. I will provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail.\nLooking first at Q1, January and February passenger revenues incurred 2 main negative impacts. First, $380 million due to softness in bookings and elevated passenger cancellations attributable to the Omicron variant. And second, an additional $50 million in January due to flight cancellations related to available staffing challenges, which were made worse by winter weather. However, we experienced a very different dynamic in March as we saw a surge in leisure travel and bookings along with a significant pickup in close-in demand. The improvement in March exceeded our original expectations for both leisure and business demand. March managed business revenues were down 36% versus March 2019 compared to our latest guidance of down 40% and put us back on a nice improvement trajectory from pre-Omicron performance in December of 2021.\nIn fact, managed business revenues improved 34 points from January's down 70% to March's down 36%. We experienced higher managed business passengers. And most notably, March marked the first month since the pandemic began where managed business fares surpassed 2019 levels.\nOur revenue initiatives performed well during Q1 despite the Omicron impact. We saw benefits from our GDS initiative given the significant bounce-back of business demand in March. We also had a strong performance from our loyalty program with other revenue up 43% versus Q1 2019, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. A nice attribute from our new co-brand credit card agreement is that the revenue stream is rather insulated or diversified from the passenger revenue impact from COVID wave as long as consumers' spending remains healthy. And Q1 retail sales spend per cardholder and overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019.\nNow our new market performance was impacted by the Omicron variant to a greater degree than the rest of our network. While Hawaii growth markets underperformed expectations slightly in March, largely driven by the COVID protocols that have since been lifted, we are encouraged by the strong demand we saw in March and heading into the summer months for Hawaii. We continue to adjust our Hawaii offering to best suit our customers' needs and allocate more of our capacity to business markets, and this can be seen in the changes beginning in June.\nIn non-Hawaii new markets, we saw a modest outperformance versus expectations due to the sharp uptick in travel demand in March, which follow the general trend of the rest of the network of broad-based improvement across all geographies. All told, for Q1, we came in at the midpoint of our operating revenue guidance at down 9%. While the Omicron impact was higher than anticipated in January and February, the improvement in March outperformed our expectations, and we're very pleased with the recent revenue trends.\nLooking at Q2, the positive momentum continues, and we're expecting the operating revenues to turn positive versus Q2 2019, estimated to be up 8% to 12% despite capacity below 2019 levels and managed business revenues yet to fully recover. As we were already operating at pre-pandemic load factors in the low to mid-80% range, our revenue improvement outlook is primarily due to higher passenger yields, both leisure and business. We expect another solid contribution from our revenue initiatives, in particular, with GDS as managed business revenues are expected to improve sequentially. April managed business revenues are expected to be down 30% versus April 2019, and we expect to see sequential improvement in May and June.\nWe also expect our new fare product to roll out this quarter, which we call Wanna Get Away Plus. Having 4 fare columns displayed in our website is a natural evolution that is geared toward offering customers the attributes they want to choose while not taking anything away. The general attributes of Wanna Get Away Plus are: the introduction of transferable flight credits; more flexibility with same-day confirmed change in standby benefits; and a higher earned multiple for Rapid Rewards points.\nAt the same time, our Anytime fares will gain the express flyby security lane and priority check-in perks where available as well as early bird check-in benefits. We believe this will better represent the product offerings that our customers want and/or when to pay for, and it has the added benefit of generating incremental revenue for the company. Given the timing of the rollout, we aren't expecting a material benefit in Q2, but we are expecting a solid revenue contribution in the second half of 2022.\nLastly, on our revenue initiatives, our revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. Before I wrap up, I want to share some color on our capacity and published flight schedules. We continue to expect our Q2 capacity to decline 7% versus Q2 2019. While this is a 2-point sequential increase in Q1, we expect a 5-point sequential decrease in stage length from Q1 as we establish trips in shorter-haul markets aimed at business travel and in an effort to provide more recoverability to the operation with more frequencies. We have now adjusted our published flight schedules through Labor Day to match flight activity to our 2022 capacity guidance.\nIn terms of network restoration, we will be roughly 80% restored by June based on trips. And based on our full year capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we expect to be roughly 85% restored by December. As we have discussed, it will take us some time to rebuild the network that we want given current staffing constraints. We will continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our network by the end of 2023.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael G. Van de Ven\n\nCOO & President, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. On our last earnings call, I walked through the availability of staffing and our challenges that we face due to the Omicron variant and the roughly 5,000 employees that became sick in the first 3 weeks of January. As a result of that, we reinstated an incentive pay program that ran from January 9 through February 8. The incentive pay program work is designed. Our employees responded very well. They picked up extra shifts that helped us cover the flight schedule and those employees out sick. While the program cost us $127 million, it afforded us an opportunity to more quickly stabilize the operation.\nIn the first 7 days of January, our on-time performance was 41.2%. From January 8 through mid-February, that on-time performance jumped to 85.1%. That put us #2 for on-time performance in the industry, and that was a monumental feat after the start to the year that we had. What I think is most impressive about our people is that they not only stepped up to cover the extra shifts during what can only be described as an Omicron crisis, but they put Southwest Airlines in the top spot for customer satisfaction in January for the DOT's Air Travel Consumer Report, and we remained in the top spot among marketing shares in February as well.\nOur people have been through a lot these last few years, and just to accomplish that in the first 2 months of this year is just superb. And my sincere thanks to everyone out there on the front line that's working hard for Southwest and/or taking great care of our customers. I am very pleased that our employees and our customers can now make a decision for themselves as to whether or not they want to wear a mask on board our aircraft. I know that enforcing mass compliance has been a tough endeavor for our employees for a long time now, and they deserve a break. The science supports the mask mandate expiring. So great news on that front.\nRelative to early January, our operational performance in February and March improved. Our February flight levels stayed relatively low at 3,300 flights per day, and then they increased to roughly 3,400 flights a day in March. And as Andrew mentioned, travel demand in March surged with load factors in the mid-80s. We anticipated a ramp-up in demand, but we did run into a few challenges during March related to weather and ATC delay programs. In mid-March, we had Winter Storm Quinlan. That impacted many of our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast airports. And then we also had a line of severe thunderstorms that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico and across Florida, and that resulted in air traffic management programs, operational adjustments and then resulting flight cancellations. In early April, we experienced a technology outage that caused similar issues, and it took a couple of days to work through that event. We've had a tough time during irregular operations given our center network and some of the unanticipated air traffic control slowdowns.\nThe good news is that we've made some adjustments to our network starting this month that we believe will help and I'll speak to them more shortly.\nOn the staffing front, we continue to aggressively hire. And as Bob mentioned, we're now targeting over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. The majority of this hiring is in the operations group, and it's imperative that we are properly staffed. The goal with the majority of these hires is to cover our published flight schedules and our capacity plans this year. But also, we intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future and get ahead of our spring and summer 2023 staffing needs. We are making great progress with hiring, but we have thousands of employees that are in training, and they're still gaining proficiency. So it just takes time before we'll going to have a full complement of frontline employees that are on the job versus either being a new hire and still in the training pipeline.\nSo we've made trade-offs with lower capacity in order to support operational reliability. And the combination of this and the continued hiring should help us as we move into the summer.\nOn behavior trends and hours worked per employee, we continue to lag prepandemic metrics. We're still experiencing higher sick time, more employees on inactive status and overall staffing availability challenges. We've also had some constraints on training throughput, but we believe we have a path to get the sufficient headcount in our key operational groups this year. It remains a work in progress, and it's one of our top priorities. Until then, our capacity will remain muted versus the aircraft that we would like to return to service to accelerate the network restoration.\nAnd lastly, Andrew mentioned that we expect our average stage length to decrease by about 5 points from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that should help us with our operational recoverability in Q2. We're adding short-haul flights in the business-oriented markets. That provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We won't snap back to a historical network composition overnight, but I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve as we restore the network through the end of next year. That should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage, and we're also working on other initiatives to improve overall efficiency and return to our historic levels of productivity.\nAnd so with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up for questions. (Operator Instructions) So Chad, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A."

My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Chad, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share some brief remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on our call today, we have our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Executive Vice President and incoming CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven.\nJust a few quick notes. First, we will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And second, we had a few special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference these non-GAAP results and our remarks today. So please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information and our cautionary statement, which covers these topics in more detail.\nSo with that, I have the pleasure of turning it over one last time to my friend, Gary Kelly.\n\nGary C. Kelly\n\nChairman & CEO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. And first and foremost, I'm delighted to be able to say there were earnings and better than we thought at Investor Day last month. It's obviously a great way to end a tough but much improved year, a great way to start a new year. We are, of course, fighting our way through the Omicron surge in January, February and looking forward to a strong rebound in March and thereafter. And as always, that's barring any unforeseen events. I expect we'll make great progress in 2022, and we'll enjoy another much improved year. .\nAs we all know too well, it will not be without its challenges, but our people and our leadership are more than up to the task. I'm enormously proud of all of them, and I thank them profusely for their resilience and their perseverance through these myriad of challenges that we've faced in the last 2 years. They've just done a phenomenal job. Southwest is on top because our people deliver great service at low fares and our business model delivers consistent profits enhancing returns on capital, and we've emerged from 2 years of pandemic with our balance sheet strength and our liquidity intact. And we are perfectly positioned to restore, to expand and compete aggressively in the coming years, and I could not be more enthused and more excited about our future.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn it over to our outstanding CEO and waiting for 5 more days, Mr. Bob Jordan.\n\nRobert E. Jordan\n\nEVP, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Gary, and hello, everybody. We were last together on December 8 at Investor Day, and a lot has happened since then. But before I get to that, I want to thank my friend, Gary Kelly. Gary is a phenomenal leader, has done so much for Southwest and for me personally. There's no -- there's just no way to say thank you enough for his 18 years of leadership as our CEO, and I'm thrilled that he will be our Executive Chairman. I'll take over the CEO responsibility for investor meetings going forward, so this is Gary's last earnings call. And my friend, I just want to stop and say a huge thank you, and I love you. .\nWell, 2022 has had a challenging start, but that doesn't change our goals for the year: getting properly staffed, focusing on our people, making meaningful progress returning to our historic operational reliability and efficiency, providing our legendary hospitality and returning to consistent profitability. We made significant progress in '21, including a profitable fourth quarter despite the pandemic that saw strong demand. 88% of 2019 revenues restored, and managed business demand ahead of our expectations for December. While we don't expect to be profitable this quarter, the Omicron impact does appear to be isolated to January and February, and we expect a profit in March. We expect to be profitable in the remaining quarters and for the full year 2022 based on our current plans.\nOur people performed just really well during the fourth quarter, as they always do, in particular during the holidays. And demand held up well through year-end despite the Omicron variant. Beginning in early January, we experienced a very difficult environment due to rapidly rising COVID cases and a decrease in available staffing levels. It's amazing. But in the first 3 weeks, we had roughly 5,000 employees test positive for COVID, with employee cases roughly 2.5x what they were during the Delta variant. The resulting staffing storage, combined with winter weather, caused a spike in flight cancels and a significant disruption to the operation. I'm pleased to report, though, that over the last few weeks, the operation and staffing have stabilized, and we've seen performance even better than during the holidays. Yesterday, for example, we were 95% on time, which I'm just hugely proud of.\nTo maintain sufficient available staff, we extended incentive pay programs for ops employees through early February. While that does add temporary cost pressure, it's imperative that we have sufficient staff to operate our schedule and minimize our flight cancellations. COVID case counts are on a downward trend, and we intend to normalize our staffing and pay structure as a result. Hiring is part of the equation, of course, and we met our 2021 hiring goals, and we are on track with plans to add at least 8,000 employees this year. We're also raising our starting wage rates to be competitive in the market and due to the impacts from Omicron and the variant and recent staffing challenges, and we're further moderating our first half 2022 capacity plans to provide additional buffer for the operation.\nWe're encouraged by the recent improvement in bookings across the booking curve, especially in the March time frame, and we are hopeful that business travel will resume the 2021 trend. It appears that Omicron impacts are pretty well contained in January and February from a revenue perspective, and we believe our temporary approach to boost available staffing is working. We'll stay flexible, of course, and we'll be willing to further adjust our plans if needed.\nSo several things have transpired since Investor Day, all driven by the pandemic, though. But for Omicron, we would be on our Investor Day Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. However, I want you to know, make no mistake, we are laser-focused on preserving our low-cost position in the industry and returning to 2018 productivity and efficiency levels by the end of 2023. We believe Q1 CASM-Ex is a peak and our plans call for unit cost to ease from here into 2023. Looking at 2023 based on current growth plans, we expect CASM-Ex to be down as compared to 2022.\nRestoring both the network and our fleet efficiency are key to returning to historic efficiency levels. And beyond that, I'm really excited about opportunities that continue network growth as we add gates in key cities such as Denver and Phoenix and Las Vegas, Baltimore, Nashville and even more. Beyond 2023, we see opportunities to meet and then beat our historic productivity and efficiency levels as we continue to grow the company and focus on modernizing our operational tools and processes, and Mike will talk more about that.\nBut I want to repeat my main message from Investor Day. Despite the near-term noise, we have a superb business model with substantial underlying competitive advantages. We have a great 5-year strategy and a strong set of initiatives that will drive significant value. Our new co-brand credit card agreement is in place with our partner, Chase. Our GDS expansion is complete, and our Southwest business team is armed with the tools they need to grow our business customer base. We continue to work on our new fare product and our revenue management system optimization, so more to come there, but both should begin producing value this year. And as we continue retiring older 737, 700 aircraft and taking the MAX aircraft this year in support of our fleet modernization initiatives as well. All combined, these initiatives are expected to deliver incremental EBIT of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2023, and we continue to expect roughly half of that value this year given the initiatives in place.\nLike Gary said, last and not least, I just want to thank our amazing people. There have been all kinds of challenges, and they have performed just superbly. They continue to do an incredible job and manage through all of these challenges, and I am just in awe of them. And together, we will emerge from the pandemic, and we will seize the opportunities in front of us.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\n\nTammy Romo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nRight. Hello, everyone, and thank you, Bob. I've worked with Bob for a long time, and I agree with Gary. He is going to be a great CEO. And my friend, Gary Kelly, you are amazing, and I just want to thank you for all that you've done for our company and for all of us and for all of our shareholders, and I'm not going to say anything else because I will get choked up. So instead, I'm going to provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our outlook beyond what we provided in our press release to you all this morning.\nAnd I also just want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience as we manage through this dynamic environment. It is their hard work, dedication and focus that enabled us to achieve an important milestone in our recovery with our first quarterly profit since the pandemic began.\nWe reported a $68 million profit in fourth quarter or $0.11 per diluted share. And excluding special items, we reported an $85 million profit or $0.14 per diluted share. As Bob mentioned, our fourth quarter profit was driven by strong leisure demand during the holidays' business travel momentum and incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. Our fourth quarter results were all within the guidance ranges provided last month at Investor Day.\nFor full year 2021, our net income was $977 million or $1.61 per diluted share, driven by $2.7 billion of payroll support program proceeds. Excluding this temporary benefit to salary wages and benefits expense and other smaller special items, our full year net loss was $1.3 billion or a $2.15 loss per diluted share. Andrew will cover our revenue trends and outlook here in a minute.\nTaking a look at cost. We continue to experience inflationary cost pressure experienced in fourth quarter, primarily in salary wages and benefits and airport costs as expected. A portion relates to hiring, and we made great strides toward our hiring efforts in 2021 and remain on track with plans this year. And of course, the labor market continues to be a challenge, which continues to pressure wage rates across the board.\nSince Investor Day, we have experienced additional cost pressures related to Omicron and winter weather. As a result, our first quarter unit cost inflation compared with first quarter 2019 and excluding fuel special items and profit sharing has increased about 10 points. Roughly half of that increase is driven by the $150 million of additional incentive pay we are offering to operations employees to early February, and the other half is associated with flying fewer ASMs than we were planning. In light of the significant impact from the Omicron wave on available staffing, extending the temporary incentive pay and further reducing our capacity were necessary steps to stabilize the operation. Aside from these impacts, we would be on track with our previous unit cost outlook.\nMarket fuel prices have continued to rise here, which also resulted in a $0.10 increase in our fuel cost per gallon guidance. Our estimated first quarter fuel price in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range is also roughly $0.25 higher than our first quarter 2019 fuel price, and math's inclusive of an estimated $0.35 of hedging gains here in the first quarter.\nTurning to our full year guidance. At Investor Day, we were planning for capacity to be roughly flat versus 2019 levels with no material impact from the Omicron variant on either revenues or costs at that time. Fast forward to today, the impact from the Omicron variant unavailable staffing has led us to reevaluate our first half 2022 capacity plans, in particular March through May. Our plant flight schedule adjustments take some capacity upside optimism off the table for this year and reduces our full year 2022 capacity outlook by about 4 points from roughly flat to down 4% versus 2019.\nI've already covered the $150 million of additional incentive pay in the first quarter. And in order to be more competitive on the hiring front, in particular for ground operations, we are raising starting wage rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour, which is estimated to be a $20 million to $25 million total impact to this year. And of course, we have contemplated labor rate inflation in our guidance as best we can for this year, understanding that the market is somewhat uncertain.\nThis is clearly not where we hope to be along our recovery curve nearly 2 years into this pandemic, but we are making great progress. While we remain nimble in this environment, it takes the necessary actions to take care of our employees and provide a reliable product for our customers. We are very focused on the long term and determined to get back to 2018 levels of productivity and efficiencies as we shared with you all at Investor Day. As Bob said, our goal is to get there by the end of next year.\nAlthough it is early based on our current plan for 2022 and preliminary plan for 2023, we expect 2023 CASM-Ex will decline year-over-year compared with 2022. Longer term, our framework that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged, and that includes a post-pandemic target of mid-single-digit ASM growth accompanied by low single-digit CASM-Ex growth. I want to be clear that our longer-term CASM-Ex framework includes an estimate for labor rate increases as best we can estimate today.\nTurning to fleet. We currently have 77 MAX firm orders and 37 MAX options with Boeing this year. While our plan assumes we will exercise the remaining 37 options this year, we maintain the flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise. We continue to believe that taking the additional options this year will yield a positive NPV on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As I have mentioned to you all before, we won't incur a material CASM-Ex penalty from holding on to extra aircraft in the event we temporarily park some of our -700 while capacity is moderated this year. As we work our way back to an efficient utilization of the fleet, we remain in the fortunate position to have the flexibility needed with our retirement plans without a financial penalty.\nI'll wrap up with a quick note on our balance sheet strength. We ended 2021 with liquidity of $16.5 billion. Our leverage is at a very manageable 54%, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which I believe is one of our key competitive advantages. We have ample liquidity that allows us for a further cushion in the event of further COVID wave. Overall, our balance sheet strength puts us in a category of one in terms of our ability to withstand shocks and remain financially healthy.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Watterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nThank you very much, Tammy. I'll also start by extending my graduate to Gary. I'll be forever grateful for all that he taught me with his words and its actions, and I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail.\nLooking back to our last earnings call in October, we were dealing with a Delta variant. The negative revenue impact to Q3 was $300 million. At that time, we estimated the negative revenue impact to Q4 of $100 million. Revenue trends have begun to pick up -- pick back up and stabilize in mid-September, and our outlook called for a sequential monthly improvement in revenues throughout Q4. We reaffirm this in our early December investor update, and we closed the quarter strong.\nOur operating revenues finished within guidance, down 11.8%. And managed business revenues came in better than guidance, down 50% in December. We saw solid leisure demand for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and business demand held up well with positive momentum from GDS and Southwest business. The negative revenue impact from the Delta variant came in lower than we thought at around $60 million as we saw a continued rebound in demand and yields throughout the quarter. However, we saw some choppiness in late December from decelerating bookings and increasing cancellations, and we had a $30 million negative revenue impact from the Omicron variant as COVID cases increased. Combined, this $90 million COVID impact on Q4 was slightly less than our original estimate of $100 million from COVID as we were able to mitigate some of the load factor decrease to higher yields.\nAnd of course, the most notable item in Q4 was incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement with Chase, which we covered at Investor Day and included in our most recent revenue guidance. While we can't share the specifics about the incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement, you can see that other revenues in fourth quarter 2021 increased 20% compared with Q4 2019 while outpacing the recovery in passenger revenue, and we are on track for expected benefits in 2022.\nOur new markets continue to develop and perform overall in line with expectations aside from the impacts from the Delta and Omicron waves. The [wing] markets also showed improvement, and all of these markets turned in line with a broad-based improvement we saw across the rest of the network.\nNow looking at first quarter. We estimate the weather-related and staff-related flight cancellations in January resulted in a $50 million negative impact to operating revenues. Additionally, bookings have slowed for January and February, which are seasonally low travel periods anyway for leisure. And trip cancellations were running quite high beginning in early January but have moderated and are back to normal trends. We expect the Omicron-related negative revenue impact to January and February combined to be roughly $330 million. Like the Delta variant, the impact of Omicron-related trip cancellations has been mainly focused in the closed-in window, and we remain optimistic about the likelihood of demand recovery and time for spring break travel.\nOn the corporate travel side, the business demand we experienced in December has slowed, but we continue to believe there is pent-up demand for business travel, and we are hearing from many of our corporate customers that they intend to travel post-President's Day. I think that will depend on where we are with COVID case counts and hospitalizations, but we are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in terms of our future travel plans. We expect first quarter managed business revenues to be down 45% to 55% versus 2019, and improve sequentially from January through March. And our Southwest and GDS business initiatives is also on track for expected benefits in 2022. When you put all these moving parts together, that gets us to our first quarter operating revenue guidance of down 10% to 15% versus first quarter 2019. This outlook is in line where we were in the fourth quarter, but we are currently expecting a step change in improvement in March. As far as our other initiatives, new fare product remains on track for deployment by midyear, and the new revenue management system continues its progressive rollout.\nAnd lastly, we're in the process of adjusting our published flight schedules in March through May in order to further support the operations and adjust to available staffing trends. The result of this exercise, combined with the flight cancellations we have experienced so far this month, is a 3-point reduction in first quarter 2022 capacity from down 6% to down 9% compared with the first quarter 2019. And for full year 2022, as Tammy mentioned, it's a 4-point reduction from roughly flat to down 4% compared with the full year 2019. Our flight schedules remain subject to further adjustments if needed. But while this is a slight delay to our previous capacity plan, we still have time to get back on track. As of March 2022, we are roughly 75% restored based on trips, and we continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our route network by the end of 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael G. Van de Ven\n\nCOO & President, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. Our people did face quite a bit of adversity in 2021, and I just am really proud of their tremendous finish to the year, and they've built quite a bit of momentum thus far into 2022. As we've all said, we've moderated or we began moderating our capacity in the fourth quarter to provide more staffing cushion in the environment. But at the same time, we knew we had some peak holiday travel periods over Thanksgiving and Christmas through the New Year's time frame, and we really did jump up our daily trips. And we needed all hands on deck to those periods, and we incented folks, and we urge them or those that were willing to pick up open time or voluntarily work on their days off with premium pay. And that certainly work. people really respond.\nSo if you exclude the day of Thanksgiving, we averaged about 3,500 trips a day during that Thanksgiving holiday period, and that was up roughly 320 trips a day above the weeks leading into Thanksgiving. And our on-time performance for that period was 87%, and that was better than our 5-year average. So we ran a similar play over the Christmas holiday, and our daily trips there increased to roughly 3,600 a day. And again, our people responded. So normally, during the Christmas holiday, we deal with weather, but this year, we also saw the beginning of a sudden in the surging spike in COVID cases. And because we had those people to pitch in to pick up extra shifts during that week of Christmas, we had a completion factor of 99.2%, and we had less than 1% of our flights canceled in the face of that COVID surge.\nAll told, we ended up the fourth quarter with an on-time performance of 72.6%, mainly due to some of the challenges we faced in October. That's certainly not up to our standards. We must do better, and we will. But our holiday performances were very good, and we know that we can operate in our peak travel days when everyone is available. So we really have momentum to build on.\nSo in contrast to those previous holiday periods, January started in the face of severe weather and this Omicron variant spreading rapidly. And as Bob mentioned, we had roughly 2.5x the number of employees with COVID cases for Omicron than we did with Delta. And we had roughly 5,000 employees become sick in the first 3 weeks of January. And so the biggest impacts were in terms of flight cancellations for the period of time, the first week of January, January 1 through January 7. And that week, we canceled roughly 3,800 flights. About 1,900 of those were for weather, and about 1,600 of those were for staffing. And then our on-time performance of that period was 41.5%. So we reinstated the incentive pay program to encourage, again, those who would come in and pick up extra shifts and help cover the flight schedule. And again, the response was superb. We got all that implemented. And so from January 9 through the 25th, our on-time performance jumped to almost 87%, and that leads the industry for marketing carriers, and the incentive pay program runs through February 8.\nWe're also benefiting from a decline in our employees that were sidelined due to COVID. Our case counts peaked in that first week of January. And just by way of example, we had over 700 pilots and 1,500 flight attendants that were able to work in that time frame. And thus, the incentive program to help cover those that were out. Those COVID numbers have dropped substantially since then to roughly 100 to 150 people for each group, and that's a lot closer to what we originally expected.\nNext, we continue to aggressively hire. Bob mentioned that getting staffed is one of our key objectives of 2022. We also want to make progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency metrics. And then a lot of ways, those go hand in hand as we're not operating at optimal levels today nor is our network restored to where we want to be relative to 2019. For the over 8,000 employees that we intend to hire this year, about 40% of them are fly crews, about 40% of them are ground operations. So it's very heavily operations-focused to support the schedule this year and beyond as we resume the growth.\nAs we restore the route network this year into 2023, that should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage. And we're also working on other initiatives to improve efficiencies. Of course, we've got the fleet modernization cost initiative, but we're also working on things like enhancing our turn times, which are already the best in the industry; expanding self-service options for our customers; and investing in daily schedule management tools, which will help us manage regular operations more efficiently. So we've got many items in our technology and process improvement pipeline in order to support our low-cost position within the industry and improve our overall efficiency and our resilience.\nJust in closing, as we move forward into 2022, we have an exceptional order book for the fleet with its economics and its flexibility. We have new technology foundations in place for our maintenance and our airport systems. We have a laser focus on getting staffed and running a reliable operation, and we're building an operations modernization portfolio of initiatives that I touched on, and our employees have sacrificed. They've worked hard through a challenging and ever-changing environment, and I think that positioned us well to carry this January momentum through the first quarter and beyond. So I am immensely grateful for the grit, their determination and, of course, their care for our customers.\nAnd so with that, Ryan, back to you.\n\nRyan Martinez\n\nVP of IR, Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nWell, thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up. So Chad, if you please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. ."

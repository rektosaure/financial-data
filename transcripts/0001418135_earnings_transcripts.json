We appreciate you taking the time to join us today both in person in New York City and over the webcast.\nBefore walking through the agenda, let me first draw your attention to the slide in recognition of the forward-looking statements we'll make today. Please also keep in mind that we will be citing non-GAAP financial measures throughout our remarks and in the presentation that is posted on our website.\nNow let's discuss what to expect during our time together. Our Chairman, Bob Gamgort, will kick off the formal presentation with welcome remarks; followed by our CEO, Tim Cofer, discussing our value creation framework and the strategic rationale for the JDE Peet's acquisition and our planned separation. Tim and Olivier Lemire, our newly appointed President of U.S. Coffee, will then walk through our future Global Coffee Co. business in more detail.\nAfter a short break, Eric Gorli, our President of U.S. Refreshment Beverages, will discuss the future Beverage Co.; SVP of Finance, Jane Gelfand, will provide an update on financials and capital structure; and Roger Johnson, our Chief Transformation and Supply Chain Officer, will walk through our integration and separation plans. Finally, Tim will provide an overview of Q3 earnings and share some final thoughts.\nIn total, the prepared remarks portion of the day should take around 2.5 hours. We'll then break for 45 minutes to allow the in-person attendees to explore our product showcase, and then we'll return for a Q&A panel. We expect to conclude our event and the webcast at around 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. We hope it will be a productive and insightful session for you.\nLet me kick things off by welcoming our Chairman, Bob Gamgort, to the stage, and he will introduce the rest of the Board members joining us today. Over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nGood morning. It's great to see everyone. Thanks for joining us here. We've got updates to provide on KDP in general, on the transaction that we announced in August. We also have some great Q3 results to talk about. So we don't want to forget those either.\nAs Chethan mentioned, we've got a number of directors here today. And what I'd like to do is just take a minute to introduce them. They are mostly all located to our right over here. .\nPam Patsley is our Lead Independent Director. She chairs our Remuneration Committee. She's our longest-standing director, having been at Dr Pepper Snapple Board prior to joining KDP. Tim Cofer, our CEO, you're going to hear a lot from him today.\nJuliette Hickman is right over there. Juliette serves on our Audit Committee. And one of our very newest directors Mike Van de Ven, who also serves on our Audit Committee. And the directors are going to be available to interact with you during breaks and during the product demonstration. So please engage with them. Pam and I are going to come back on stage with the management team at the end of the day and answer questions as part of the formal Q&A session.\nSo my purpose today is really to represent the perspective of the Board. And I want to kick off today by offering 5 points that I think the Board would like to emphasize at the start here. First of all, KDP has a long and consistent track record of delivering strong results. Since formation, 6% revenue CAGR, 11% EPS CAGR, and that places us in the top tier of CPG peers.\nBut from a Board perspective, our job is not to look backwards and congratulate ourselves on good results. It's really to position the company for future success. And that's why we have conviction in this acquisition and separation. What's important is for you to have more detailed information, more insight in our thought process. And that's what we want to do today, so that you can come along with us on our journey on how we came to that conclusion and why we continue to have great confidence in the value creation potential of the transactions.\nHaving said that, we heard your feedback. We certainly noted the market reaction. And it made it really clear to us that we needed a day like today to better explain the strategy and the thought process behind it, as I said. We also recognize we needed to change some of the executional elements of the transaction. You saw the press release today. Those are good developments, and we'll talk about more optionality going forward. But we really think we're on the right track and are being very responsive to your feedback.\nSo going from today to this future end state requires great execution. So in addition to talking about the end state, we need to give you confidence in execution. And we'll do that today by showing you our integration plans. But I think more importantly, we're going to give you exposure to more people on our management team who are actually responsible for that and for running the company and making sure that we continue to deliver great results like we just did in Q3. So you'll meet them.\nAnd then we're going to be flexible. I mean you've seen that we've been flexible since announcement. We're going to look for other opportunities to maximize value, and we'll talk about some of the areas where we're thinking about flexibility going forward throughout this presentation.\nSo I think there are 3 points that I would like to comment on before I turn it over to Tim, because I'm in a unique position to do this. So first of all, is the global coffee category. So you'll find it interesting, but the left-hand side there is my trophy from 1985. This was an on-campus competition sponsored by General Foods, and it was called the Maxwell House Brand Management Challenge. And it was about the coffee category. And my team won it, which is why we have the trophy. It sparked my career in CPG; it also is how I entered General Foods. And it also started a 40-year relationship with the coffee category. So I've seen it over an extended period of time.\nSo there's no question, in the post-COVID period, we saw a slowdown in the global coffee category. We also are beginning to see signs of recovery. And what typically happens is a 3-year window starts to become reality. We never thought that this was anything more than temporary or cyclical. It's not structural. And if you look at the category over 40 years, you will see periods of time where the category slowed down, only to accelerate rapidly afterwards. And that's exactly where we think we are right for now. We're in the beginning of a recovery period.\nOver that 40-year period, the volume growth of coffee is a 2% CAGR. And we know that in CPG, volume growth, real growth is scarce and important. But it's undeniable when you look at a 40-year trend on coffee, the trajectory continues to be going in the right direction. Actually, Tim has a chart that will show you that very, very clearly.\nSo let's think about this. We believe it's cyclical and we're in the beginning of a recovery, we have a strong business in KDP coffee, anchored by Keurig, we really believe to succeed going forward in coffee, you got to be global. We'll talk a bit about that. So if you want to form a global coffee powerhouse, the best partner is JDE Peet's. This is a scarce and valuable asset. It's of high quality. And honestly, there is no alternative other than matching these 2 businesses together. And when you see the fit, it is striking how much each business complements each other. And we're confident that together, we will form a formidable global coffee competitor.\nSo that gets to another question that came up from time to time in the past couple of weeks, which is, what happened to the investment thesis? How has it changed? So I'll start with a real obvious comment, which is since we put the companies together 7 years ago, a lot has changed in the world. Competitors, consumers, our customers and the way they think about it. Certainly, the macro environment is different. So I think it's natural and necessary to evolve our strategy as well.\nIn 2018, the play was a really good insight at that point in time. We took 2 subscale beverage companies who are solely focused on North America. We brought them together to create a beverage challenger of scale. And it was wildly successful. If you take a look at what's happened over the past 7 years, I gave you the aggregate financial performance. But beyond that, the strength of each individual company enhanced significantly over that time.\nSo if we're going to put together these 2 companies to form a global coffee competitor, and we'll talk about why global is important later, we could run them together. It is an option to run them as one company, but we think it is optimal to separate them. One company focused on a global opportunity, which is a very different management mindset, obviously, on one category, coffee, across the entire world of all forms. And the other to continue to run this very valuable North American refreshment beverage growth machine that has significant runway still in front of it.\nIt also gives investors a choice in 2 different styles of running these companies. More to come on that, but it really shows that there was this natural evolution that started in 2018 and is our choice to run them separately.\nYou're going to hear from a number of speakers.\nAnd I think the third area where I can offer unique perspective is my confidence in the management team. Tim, who you're going to hear from right after me, will run the combined businesses. And then upon separation, he will be the CEO of our stand-alone beverage company. Olivier, Eric and Roger, I have worked with since the take-private of Keurig in 2016. My experience with Jane goes back further than that. Jane was at Barclays in 2012, and she was part of the team that supported the IPO of Pinnacle Foods where I was CEO.\nAnd the reason I give you that time period of my experience is I have seen this team deliver across a wide variety of challenging situations time and time again. I have the highest level of confidence in their ability to execute, and that gives me confidence that we can get from where we are today to an outstanding end game when we separate these companies.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Tim Cofer, our CEO. He'll take you through a significant amount of content along with all of these other presenters. And as I said upfront, I look forward to being back up here at the end with Pam. We'll be happy to answer your questions at that time. So Tim, over to you.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nAll right. Good morning, everyone. Great to see all of you again. I hope you've had a chance already to enjoy some of the amazing beverages that we have across these stations, for those of you that are here live with us at NASDAQ. I can imagine the coffee stations were hit pretty hard if being a Monday morning and all.\nSo building on Bob's comments, we have strong conviction in the strategic and financial merits of this acquisition of JDE Peet's and the subsequent separation into these 2 pure-play companies. We are creating North America's most agile beverage challenger and a true global coffee powerhouse.\nAt the same time, as Bob said, I have spent the last 2 months absorbing shareholder feedback and, of course, the initial market reaction post the announcement. And I recognize that there are a few areas of concern as well as some open questions that would benefit from more explanation. That is why we're here today.\nSo in my discussions, with each of you, I think the questions have largely spanned these 4 areas. Why is Peet's the right acquisition? What does the separation into Beverage Co. and Global Coffee Co. uniquely enable? How will we optimize KDP's capital structure post the acquisition and establish appropriate balance sheets for each of these separate entities? And how will we ensure that KDP delivers with success throughout this process? Over the next couple of hours, we will answer these questions and more.\nNow before diving into these topics, let's reground you in our business and our strategy. We operate with a sole focus on beverages. I truly believe this is the best sector in CPG. It's large. It generates $1 trillion at a global level. It's growing. We expect a mid-single-digit CAGR in the coming years, supported by structural tailwinds to sustain that momentum. It's dynamic with ever-evolving consumer preferences that create endless opportunities to drive consistent growth through innovation, through mix management, through premiumization. It's financially attractive, strong profitability, compelling industry return profiles.\nSo we understand this beverage industry very well. and we have a proven, and successful value creation strategy. At the core of this, as you see on this slide, are 5 pillars. They serve as our blueprint for how we drive sustainable, consistent, compelling performance over time. The first 3 of those are commercial priorities, broadly geared around the top line. The 2 enterprise enablers support that growth in a profitable, efficient and high-return way.\nLet me touch very briefly on each one. Championing consumer-obsessed brand building. This means being consumer-led, consumer-centric as we nurture and expand our iconic brands, shaping our now and next beverage portfolio to access growth-accretive white spaces via our flexible build, buy or partner model, amplifying our route-to-market advantage, strengthening our multichannel leadership with differentiated distribution capabilities.\nGenerating fuel for growth by reinforcing a continuous productivity mindset and a lean overhead operating model. And of course, dynamically allocating capital to support that long-term value creation.\nHow we applied that to our businesses? Let's start with Refreshment Beverage. Our results speak for themselves. Our flagship Dr Pepper, we've turned this into the CSD categories, innovation and marketing leader. We've driven nearly a decade of consistent market share gains, and we've established ourselves as the #2 market share position in the category.\nWe've thoughtfully built out meaningful incremental growth platforms in white spaces that we previously didn't compete in, like energy and sports hydration. And we've strengthened our competitively advantaged route-to-market DSD network through capital-efficient territory expansions, through brand partnerships and capability investments. The result of the efforts, you see at the bottom of the page, a high single-digit net sales CAGR since 2018. And we're just getting started, with business momentum that should support continued sustained growth into the future.\nWhat about in coffee? Look, we know the operating backdrop in U.S. coffee has been more dynamic over the last few years, particularly in that post-COVID world and the multiple commodity cycles like the one we're in now. And yet, we made important strides. We've reinforced Keurig's position as the #1 North American single-serve system across both brewers and pods. We've extended our portfolio into exciting growth areas like cold and super premium. We've continued to expand the number of households that brew Keurig every morning, now at 47 million strong and growing. And we are preparing to catalyze the next chapter of our growth agenda with disruptive innovation.\nWe've invested in unique assets that drive competitive advantage, including our differentiated and highly profitable direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. All of these initiatives have supported a steady, low single-digit sales CAGR in recent years, consistent with our go-forward expectations.\nSo through these commercial achievements as well as robust productivity and thoughtful cash deployment, we've delivered strong results at an enterprise level. Since KDP's formation in 2018, as you see on this slide, we've grown net sales at a 6% CAGR. We've grown adjusted EPS at an 11% CAGR, while also returning meaningful cash to our shareholders.\nNow at the same time, both our businesses and the external environment have changed in significant ways since 2018. Just as Bob discussed earlier, the original merger thesis was really predicated on combining what at the time was 2 subscale businesses. We did that to create a North American beverage challenger.\nWhat's happened in the last 7 years? Our Refreshment Beverage business is no longer subscale. In fact, it is the same size today as total KDP at merger. Our actions to evolve our Ref Bev portfolio to strengthen our route to market have also structurally raised the organic profile of this business relative to 2018.\nAnd in coffee, while we made progress, we acknowledge that the category growth trend has fallen short of our expectations in recent years. And while we're the clear leader in North American single-serve, that business is arguably subscale, in particular, relative to our global competitors that can leverage broader advantages in technology and sourcing and who can participate across the entire global coffee category.\nSo as a Board and a management team, we observed these changes since 2018. We discussed these and we reached a couple of conclusions. First, our Refreshment Beverage business has both the scale and the advantaged positioning to succeed, as Bob said, either as a combined company or a stand-alone. And second, while our Coffee business has clear strengths, it is not yet optimized to reach its full potential in current form. And we decided as a Board that it needed further assessment and it could benefit from potential enhancement.\nSo the first step in that assessment was to step back and take a fresh look at the coffee category. You've heard Bob's story, 40 years ago, the Maxwell House Award. I've also spent a lot of my career in coffee in a past life different employer. We're long-term believers in the attractiveness of the global coffee category. We believe in the structural tailwinds supporting future growth. But we did the analysis once again to underwrite our confidence.\nLet's start with the consumer lens. Coffee remains a preferred way to address the universal human need for energy, and it's ever more important these days. Coffee is a highly emotional category. It evokes passion. It's artisanal. Craft specialization plays a key role in premiumizing the category, which is a clear growth tailwind. Coffee is habitual. Coffee has unmatched global frequency of consumption.\nAnd coffee is healthy, even as defined by regulators, both in this country and globally. Simply put, coffee is the #1 beverage American consumers cannot live without. And I am certainly one of them. And it enjoys that similar status in so many markets around the world.\nNow to see the evidence of this category's essential nature, look at the long-term trend on the chart. Bob mentioned this in his opening remarks. What you'll see over 40 years is a low single-digit global volume growth. And in dollar terms, recent growth trends are even faster, thanks to premiumization and innovation. Importantly, the structural factors supporting consumption growth remain as powerful as ever. And I would highlight that increased adoption, especially in emerging markets, as younger generations embrace coffee culture and begin to shift versus historic tea culture, is yet another growth tailwind long term.\nNow as with many categories, coffee goes through cycles, including most recently this post-COVID lull that we've experienced. But as Bob said and as this chart, I think, pays off nicely, the historic pattern is that these lulls are temporary and the category recovers to its long-term growth trajectory.\nWe're seeing signs of this right now in the United States, this post-COVID recovery is underway. Category volume trends bottomed out in 2022. They've been stabilizing ever since. And encouragingly, this dynamic also holds true this year, year-to-date 2025, even as this high inflation has fueled significant price increases. You see here that the elasticities on an absolute basis compare favorably to the historic trend.\nSo that was our assessment, our step-back assessment, on the coffee category. With renewed confidence in the attractiveness of that global coffee category, our challenge was then to determine, how do we optimize our coffee business? Our goal here was to create an even stronger business, with higher growth prospects, greater resilience and improved operational efficiencies.\nAnd look, we considered all options. All options were on the table. Sell the business. Spin it off as a stand-alone. Continue to operate it as part of KDP. But ultimately, after thorough diligence, our management team and our Board of Directors determined that the acquisition of JDE Peet's represented the most attractive and actionable path for maximizing the value of our Coffee business.\nHere's the reality. Scale matters in coffee. The category addresses a universal need state: common formats, common consumer trends, similar premiumization opportunities across markets. This means that consumer insights, innovation, technologies can be leveraged and reapplied across markets. And of course, in coffee, there are clear economies of scale in operations and costs. Bob said it in his opening remarks, JDE Peet's is one of the very few assets of global scale in this category, and it will step-change curing in several ways.\nYou see it on this chart. Our coffee net sales will more than triple to $16 billion, making us the second largest global coffee player and the largest pure play. We'll gain access to additional geographies, including many high-growth markets. We'll become a significantly larger manufacturer and the #1 coffee buyer in the world. These elements are critical to fortifying Keurig as an even stronger coffee player. In JDE Peet's, we also see a unique fit with the Keurig business.\nThrough this combination, we can bring together the best of both companies: Keurig's North American leadership, know-how, innovation prowess; and JDE Peet's global reach, leading brands and full format expertise. The resulting Global Coffee Co. will enjoy an advantaged and complementary portfolio, incremental revenue opportunities, visible, actionable, achievable cost synergies and greater resilience.\nLet's unpack each of these 4. Starting with advantaged and complementary portfolio. The combined company will be able to benefit from global category growth given its strong brand portfolio, including 4 billion-plus trademarks, broad participation across every coffee [ subsegment ] and geographic diversification.\nMoving to enhanced revenue potential. We see upside potential from scaling Keurig's system expertise and JDE Peet's format capabilities across more brands and more markets, capitalizing on the growth runway for Peet's here in the United States and extending Keurig's next-generation coffee systems beyond North America.\nThe third is clear and actionable cost synergies. We will discuss this in more detail, but we have identified clear and actionable efficiencies that we know will generate $400 million in savings in the next 3 years. These synergies can fund reinvestment while also supporting earnings growth.\nAnd finally, increased resilience. Obviously, as a larger company with greater supply chain capabilities, we will be much better positioned to navigate external volatility like tariffs and commodity fluctuations. Together, the union of JDE Peet's and Keurig will create a stronger business that is more efficient and more capable of delivering consistent, profitable growth.\nSo upon closure of the JDE Peet's acquisition, we will, for the first time, have scaled advantage platforms in both Refreshment Beverages and Coffee. Through the subsequent separation, each of these businesses will become that focused pure play with attractive yet distinct profiles. Beverage Co., a growth-oriented player, supported by a leading brand portfolio, a competitively advantaged route to market. The business will be disruptive. The business will be entrepreneurial, and it will deliver an attractive growth profile with potential upside from strategic optionality over time.\nGlobal Coffee Co. will be a steady grower, with strong and resilient cash flow, enhanced by near-term synergy capture opportunities. Performance will be supported by differentiated deep coffee capabilities and expertise.\nAnd as we've said earlier, while we could conceivably run these 2 businesses together, we believe the separation will provide clear benefits to both entity. What are those benefits?\nFirst, focus. Each company will tailor its strategy, its operating model, its capital allocation priorities, to align with distinct category and geographic exposures. Culture. The respective leadership teams will have strategic clarity, and we can structure and incentivize our organizations accordingly. Strategic optionality. Each stand-alone entity can think creatively and flexibly in pursuing additional value creation opportunities. And finally, shareholder benefits. Investors will be offered the opportunity for 2 very attractive yet distinct investment opportunities.\nNow as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we have conviction in these transactions and we have a clear view of the compelling destination once this is complete. It's now on us to execute with excellence. And that all begins with a robust plan and the right team.\nSo we've recently established a Transformation Management Office or TMO to drive this comprehensive integration program. Bob mentioned it earlier. It will be led by our newly appointed Chief Transformation and Supply Chain Officer, Roger Johnson. You'll hear more from Roger in a minute.\nThe TMO structure is designed to establish the processes and the workflows to guide our integration teams, while also, importantly, freeing up the rest of the KDP organization to focus on maintaining that great base business momentum that you've seen us deliver again in Q3. The TMO will be comprised of a dedicated internal team, in partnership with key advisers that will be responsible for the integration planning, the future company design for the value capture. Our Board of Directors and my executive steering committee will obviously provide support and oversight.\nImportantly, many of these leaders, team members, advisers obviously have significant experience in executing complex transactions like this. As just one example, among others, I was fortunate enough to have a central role in the Kraft acquisition of Cadbury and the subsequent separation into Mondelez International Kraft Foods Group. Many of the other leaders, including those you'll hear from today, have had similar experience with complex transactions like this. We will draw upon those collective experiences to further derisk the next steps.\nSo one important element of executing these transactions is ensuring that we have the appropriate capital structures for KDP at acquisition close and, importantly, for each independent entity upon separation. We are well aware that some investors were uncomfortable with our initially proposed post-transaction leverage. And as you've seen today in the press release, we've taken meaningful action to address those concerns.\nSo we've announced 2 cost-efficient transactions: a minority investment into a newly-created coffee manufacturing JV and a private convertible investment into our future beverage co. These 2 equity-like instruments will help to shore up our balance sheet.\nAs you see on this slide and in the release, we now expect net leverage to be below 5x when the acquisition closes. And we're also targeting initial leverage ranges for BevCo in a range of 3.5 to 4x, and Global Coffee Co. in a range of 3.75 to 4.25x. Based on the anticipated cost of this new financing, we continue to expect very attractive returns on our JDE Peet's acquisition, including year 1 EPS accretion of approximately 10%.\nThese capital raises also have the benefit of partnering and aligning KDP with sophisticated strategic investors, including Apollo and KKR, who understand and appreciate our vision.\nLet me walk you through the key acquisition, integration and separation milestones from here. We said this back when we announced the deal in late August. We continue to expect that the JDE Peet's deal will close in the first half of 2026. Our path to separation will be milestone-based with a plan for us to be operationally ready by the end of 2026.\nBut before separating, we want the following conditions to be in place. First, a quick start to synergy capture. Second, balance sheet readiness for both companies. Third, an independent Board of Directors, an experienced leadership team for each stand-alone company. And finally, market conditions that are conducive.\nBut as we've said all along, we will be flexible in our approach to secure the best outcome. In that spirit, as we optimize from here, one element where we're taking a refreshed approach is to our leadership. We've made the decision to not name the leader of Global Coffee Co. at this time. And we no longer intend for Sudhanshu Priyadarshi to serve in that future role. We will name full leadership teams of both new companies at a future date closer to separation.\nSo before we unpack both Global Coffee Co. coal and Beverage Co, let me conclude with 3 priorities to maximize value creation. First, maintaining base business momentum. As you saw this morning, we reported strong Q3 results. In fact, we raised net sales outlook and we reaffirmed our full year EPS guidance. You should have also seen that JDE Peet's this morning reaffirmed its full year guidance. Indeed, we are initiating this transformation from a position of strength.\nSecond priority: integrating with excellence to achieve our key deal objectives. You'll hear more from Roger about the processes and the plans we're putting in place to underwrite successful outcomes. And third, setting up each company for success with focused strategies, tailored operating models, purposeful capital allocation. After the separation, we expect both companies will offer their shareholders quality, consistency, simplicity and be viewed as world-class leaders in their sectors.\nOkay. With that, let's move to Global Coffee Co. We're going to bring this new company to life in a couple of sections. First, I'll invite Olivier Lemire to stage. He's our recently appointed President of U.S. Coffee, and he'll give an overview of the attractive Keurig Coffee business. I'll then return to talk about JDE Peet's specifically, and then the combined Global Coffee Co.\nReal quick, additional intro on Olivier. He is a tremendous leader. He's been with KDP for 14 years. The last 4, he was President of our KDP Canada business. And I can tell you, in that capacity, he led KDP Canada to significant coffee outperformance, consistently growing pod volume, brewer volume, net sales and operating income. Indeed, Olivier knows the coffee business.\nHe has deep experience with integrations as well, including steering the former Keurig Canada and Canada Dry Mott's integration. Overall, he built a very strong Canadian organization, and we're very excited for him to take this U.S. coffee desk.\nOlivier, over to you.\n\nOlivier Lemire\n\nPresident of U.S. Coffee\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. So after 14 years in the coffee and beverage industry, I've seen firsthand the unique power of coffee to bring people together, whether it's friends, families, colleagues. There's just no other beverage like it. And from my time and country of origin with coffee farmers to walking the floor of our different coffee labs and manufacturing facilities, to building strong relationship with our many brand partners, my passion for coffee and strong conviction about the future of our coffee business has only grown. So it's a real honor to now lead our U.S. Coffee business and the amazing team behind the Keurig system.\nAnd with this system, we've created and now drive a highly profitable subsegment of the coffee category. Over the last 12 months, we've driven $4.6 billion in net sales and $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA. We are trusted by some of the best coffee brands in the world with unmatched capability, quality and scale. Brand names like Starbucks, Lavazza, Dunkin', Peets, McCafe, La Colombe and Tim Horton's and many more. And it goes as well for our own powerhouse coffee brands: Green Mountain Coffee, the Original Donut Shop and Van Houtte.\nKeurig is -- and it's all driven by the Keurig brand. Keurig is a beloved brand with 94% brand awareness. It is truly the undisputed leader in single-serve coffee. Keurig is one of those handful of businesses that have become synonymous with their categories. People don't say, \"I hope our vacation rental as a single-serve coffee maker.\" They say, \"I hope our Airbnb has a Keurig.\"\nAnd we don't take that lightly. Since 2019, we've added 13 million active households, reaching 47 million in North America by 2024. We've gone from being 1 in 4 coffee makers sold at retail to being 1 in 3 today. And the Keurig system over these years continue to gain market share in both the coffee makers but also the coffee categories, with K-Cup pods now being the largest coffee format and actually driving twice the retail sales to the next closest format.\nAnd from the start, the Keurig system was designed to offer variety and choice to our consumer. And this open system drives significant value for all of our stakeholders. Our consumer love us for quality, our convenience and the variety of brands and beverages they can enjoy. Our partners value our quality, our system expertise and coffee know-how. And the retailers would recognize that we've driven premiumization in the coffee category with single-serve and K-Cup pods driving more revenue per every cup of coffee. So this creates a very strong growth engine. More brands, more variety, appeals to more household, generating more profit to be reinvested in the system.\nWe also have a very strong track record of building and accelerating coffee brands, starting with our very own Green Mountain Coffee now realizing more than $800 million in retail sales annually and holding the #2 position in the Keurig system. It is part of a robust owned and licensed portfolio of brands that drives strong distribution and, obviously, retail activation.\nHere are a few examples. McCafe was a brand in decline when it transitioned over in our system mid-2020, and has been growing share every year since. Lavazza is the fastest-growing brand since we took over the selling rights, and we see acceleration in distribution and retail activation. And finally, the Original Donut Shop, we know flavored coffee is actually growing faster than black coffee and is the leader in flavored coffee growth with unique partnerships and beverage types.\nIn addition, we have a very powerful asset in our business with keurig.com. The keurig.com consumer consumes twice the daily average and has a 5x lifetime value versus the average household. While keurig.com is an excellent sales channel for our coffee business, it is also a significant driver of household penetration, being the fourth largest sales channel for brewers in volume. The site enables us to have a one-on-one relationship with more than 1.5 million consumers each month. If it were to be part of our retail channels, keurig.com would be amongst our top 5 with other industry giants.\nFor those that know our brand history know that Keurig was actually founded in the workplaces, delivering a fresh brewed solution over the dreaded stale pot of office coffee. And on that foundation, we've built a very strong business and away from home with now 650,000 workplaces with active brewers and 1.2 million hotel room. And we actually see significant upside in large away-from-home areas, primarily corporate workplaces, manufacturing, health care, construction.\nThere is a powerful synergistic relationship between our out-of-home and at-home channels, with workplaces serving as a great trial environment for both the Keurig system and our many brands in the portfolio.\nOur Coffee business has actually delivered meaningful productivity over the last 5 years, averaging 4% in year-over-year cost savings through a series of initiatives ranging from tactical to strategic. These programs include brewer-direct import, large [indiscernible], lightweight cups, and meaningful reductions across process and product waste. Our productivity initiatives usually serve dual purpose of generating cost savings and advancing our sustainability agenda, reducing packaging, eliminating waste and driving a more efficient logistics.\nSo by being cost conscious and driving a productivity mindset throughout the organization, we unlock fuel to reinvest in our business. And with that fuel, we can actually drive and accelerate our strategic imperatives. We know our business is strong and we know we can improve. And over the last year, we've actually refined our consumer-centric strategy.\nAnd we're focused on 4 key areas: driving household penetration, growing premium coffee, scaling cold coffee solution and defining the future coffee system.\nIn terms of Keurig, we're excited about our new marketing campaign hitting in Q4. It will have strong in-market presence. And we believe that with consumer insights and strong data-driven campaigns, we will be able to continue to unlock household penetration.\nWith premium coffee, we are on the eve of launching our first-ever coffee brand with the Keurig name: the Keurig Coffee Collective. It will be our first scaled and premium own premium brand. It features elevated packaging. It will -- sorry, elevated packaging. It will have 30% more coffee within each cup, and will have distinctively delicious blends.\nAnd we're leaning into cold coffee solutions with innovations across brewers, pods and ready-to-drinks. We've actually recently launched new refreshers based on TikTok, and we found new ways to offer consumer the way to customize their favorite cold beverages.\nAnd as you would have seen in the product showcase, and invite you to do so at the break, we are getting ready to disrupt once again the coffee category with the launch of a breakthrough system, Keurig Alta. Keurig Alta uses round plastic-free and aluminum free pods. It is designed to offer a large range of barista-style beverages, including rich cups of coffee, authentic espresso and a variety of coffee shop style beverage, either hot or cold.\nWe have completed multiple rounds of in-home testing with the Keurig Alta system, supported by pilot production of the K-Rounds. And we are looking forward to sharing this innovative format with consumers soon. And while it's early days, we are excited to think about scaling this innovation in the future.\nSo with that, I'd like to welcome Tim back up to speak to JDE Peet's and how these 2 complementary businesses will be even stronger together. Thank you.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.",
    "content2": "All right. I will put in a plug for those last 2 coffees that Olivier shared with you. If you've not tried our new Keurig Coffee Collective, for those of you in the room, it's in that station back there, my favorite new K-Cup pod, outstanding cup of coffee. And then Alta. Please be sure and try Alta before you go today.\nSo I will start this next section with thoughts on JDE Peet's, including an overview of the business, why we think it's such a compelling asset and some of the recent strategic changes that are underway at that management team. Then I'll discuss Global Coffee Co. and highlight how the complementary nature of JDE Peet's and Keurig creates this attractive pure play, is truly positioned to win.\nSo if you're wondering, what am I doing here? Why am I the guy talking about JDE Peet's? The answers are, number one, I will be responsible for it while we run for a period of time as a combined company. Number two is I do have an up-close perspective on this having spent months of diligence on this acquisition and getting to meet and interact with this leadership team. And number three is, believe it or not, I used to run some of these brands back in a past life, brands like Jacobs, Tassimo, Kenco, Gevalia and others. So I actually think I know firsthand the strength of these brands and the roles that they play in the lives of our consumers and our customers.\nI also want to tell you, we are very pleased that we actually have the CEO of JDE Peet's, Rafa Oliveira, in the room. Rafa, you can give a quick wave. There he is. He's in the audience. Rafa and I, as you might imagine, have gotten to know each other pretty well over the last few months. And he's actually here States side for a couple of days. Tomorrow, he'll be at our Boston headquarters as we're advancing our integration and transformation agenda.\nSo let's talk about JDE Peet's. JDE Peet's is a unique asset. It's large. It's profitable. It is a global pure-play coffee company. $11 billion in net sales, nearly $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. The company holds the #1 or the #2 share position in dozens of markets around the world, reflecting an enviable portfolio of leading coffee brands.\nThe business is anchored by billion-dollar icons like Peet's, L'OR, Jacobs, but it also boasts a sizable regional and local portfolio, brands like Pilão, Moccona and Friele, among others.\nJDE is also distinguished by its rich coffee heritage. This company has deep, deep coffee expertise. Its participation in coffee dates back to the 1700s with the founding of Douwe Egberts in the Netherlands. And its capabilities are quite strong.\nAs one example, we put it on this chart, the company has the ability to produce over 1,000 distinct coffee blends. You can imagine that's a skill and capability, especially useful in times of extreme coffee inflation and the tariff volatility.\nFor me, one of the simplest ways to understand this company's strength is by looking at a map of the world. Many countries have large and vibrant coffee categories, and JDE Peet's is present in most of those countries, often with a leading position. Coffee is a category in which the market leader is frequently a regional or local favorite, not necessarily a global brand. Consumers are fiercely loyal to their local brands, particularly in the largest and most developed coffee markets. And JDE Peet's has a portfolio aligned to that reality.\nSo in the Netherlands and Belgium, Douwe Egberts is the category standard. In the U.K., it's Kenco. In Brazil, it's Pilão. In Germany and actually much of Central and Eastern Europe, it's Jacobs. And in France, it's L'OR. And that's just scratching the surface of their market leadership.\nSo we recognize that this company's brands may be less familiar to an American audience, but as you can see, they're powerful equities with strong resonance in their core markets. And I'd be remiss to say that these brands also produce a very good tasting cup of coffee, each very individualized kind of taste-of-the-nation qualities. Again, for those of you that are here, there's a station on my back left there that will give you a nice assortment of their brands. And I highly recommend, if you haven't had enough coffee already, please try it at the next break.\nAnother hallmark of JDE Peet's is the broad category participation. The company has an offering spanning all major coffee formats, from whole bean, roast-and-ground, single-serve, liquid, ready-to-drink, concentrate. The portfolio also captures the full price tiers, from mainstream to super premium. The channel diversity is universal, including all major at-home and away-from-home channels where coffee is consumed. You can imagine, there are significant strategic benefits to this broad category participation.\nNow given its advantaged brand portfolio and strong capabilities, it's probably no surprise that JDE Peet's is also a leading partner to retailers across the globe. I'll give you one example. This chart here of a retailer -- a major retailer in France. L'OR actually holds the distinction as the #1 brand in all of CPG, driving growth for the retail trade in France over the last 10 years, ahead of even the biggest global trademarks like Coca-Cola. These photos that you see on the slide underscore the level of in-store activation that retailer support because of the power of these coffee brands and the central role that they play in building shopper basket and driving category growth.\nJDE Peet's brand strength also extends to the consumer. Its portfolio has beloved trademarks, obviously, evidenced by those strong market shares I showed you. But what's equally important and I think encouraging for future growth prospects is the brand's particular resonance among younger consumers.\nIn some markets, here are 3 examples. The sub 30-year-old demographic prefers the leading JDE Peet's brand by nearly a 2:1 margin relative to the next largest player. That type of brand loyalty among the next generation is priceless. As younger consumers grow their spending and influence in coffee as they age, JDE Peet's appeal to these groups should represent a growth tailwind.\nThe company also has brands with a demonstrated ability to stretch, and I'll give you 2 examples on this chart. Take L'OR. L'OR began as a roast-and-ground coffee staple. But it's now expanded into basically all other consumable formats, including into appliances. And these adjacencies now account for a meaningful percent of total L'OR brand sales.\nThe other example, Jacobs. Jacobs started as a German icon. But over the last couple of decades has successfully established #1 positions across Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, in 19 markets. Now more than half the sales of Jacobs is outside of its home country of Germany.\nI think this is notable because one of the incremental revenue opportunities from combining Keurig and JDE Peet's is the pairing of our technology and our innovation with JDE Peet's brands. We believe the stretch potential of these JDE Peet's trademarks can create intriguing growth opportunities down the road.\nBeyond the commercial success, the JDE Peet's business has also demonstrated resilient financial performance. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone in this room. In fact, a few chats I did prior to the start reflect this, that the last few years has been marked by quite a bit of unusual level of green coffee inflation. Triple-digit cumulative cost pressure on arabica and robusta. You see the numbers on this chart. And yet, even as a coffee pure play, this business has delivered steady and consistent gross profit growth. I think another indication of brand strength.\nBringing it all together, it's clear for us that JDE Peet's has a strong structural foundation. This is a good business. It's got iconic brands, it's got significant capabilities. Yet it's also true that it's a business with significant value creation potential that has yet to be fully realized.\nTo be clear, JDE Peet's management team recognized this, and they've already begun the important work to begin to capture that potential upside. They hosted a Capital Markets Day back in July and they set a path to become a more agile, more focused, more commercially capable organization. I visited Amsterdam a few times with Rafa and team. And I can already see the early stages of this important cultural shift taking hold.\nThe centerpiece of their approach is an evolved strategy, and they aptly call it \"Reignite the amazing.\" Now there are many elements to the plan, but I'll just highlight a few notable points. An emphasis on fewer, bigger bets, with resources and management attention going towards the largest brands. Greater consumer centricity and commercial excellence. And a stepped-up productivity flywheel to unlock savings, flexibility and agility.\nThe strategy makes sense, and it's definitely aligned with CPG best practices and operating principles. And upon integrating JDE Peet's with Keurig, we would expect to continue this work and harmonize it into a combined strategic playbook for Global Coffee Co.\nIt remains early days as they've embarked on this new strategy, but I would tell you, there's already some initial proof points showing up from this refined strategic approach. I'll give you a couple of examples. On big bets, JDE Peet's is prioritizing leveraging insights and infrastructure to launch compelling innovations and ideas across multiple brands and multiple geographies in a highly efficient and profitable way. As one example, right now, there's a hot trend out there called Dubai Chocolate. JDE Peet's was able to quickly launch a Dubai Chocolate coffee mix across multiple brands in 20 markets this year using this platforming approach.\nLess visibly but no less critically, the company has also made progress in refining its marketing approach and building capabilities in key areas like revenue growth management. We certainly know from experience the payback from these investments can be very high when you get it right.\nAnd finally, JDE Peet's is also beginning to progress its productivity program that they unveiled on their Capital Markets Day. The plan targets EUR 500 million in savings through 2032, with roughly half being reinvested in the business.\nFour primary areas underpinning this target. Portfolio simplification across brands and SKUs and the manufacturing and distribution footprint. Simplified ways of working, which involves removing complexity and generating savings accordingly. Continuous improvement in sourcing, in design and plant level productivity. And driving improvements in the company's asset-light route-to-market system.\nAs you can imagine, we carefully vetted this program as part of our diligence, and we're confident that the savings are achievable. JDE Peet's has already begun to implement this program, including some plant closures and other operating efficiencies that they announced this morning in their press release.\nSo you've now heard Olivier talk about the strengths and our future growth plans for Keurig. You've now heard me walk through the virtues of JDE Peet's. Let's now talk about what happens when we put these businesses together.\nSo let's start with some background. These businesses are strong in their own right. They've proven resilient and they've delivered solid performance in a very challenging operating backdrop the last few years. You see on this chart, sales growth and adjusted EBITDA ranging in the low single digits.\nAnd importantly, each business has proven highly cash generative. For example, you see here, Keurig, we expect to deliver more than $600 million of free cash flow this year. And JDE Peet's this morning reaffirmed its outlook for the year of EUR 1 billion, about $1.2 billion. When we put these 2 companies together, we expect even stronger top and bottom line growth going forward. And let me take you through why we believe that.\nTo start, Global Coffee Co. will be an advantaged market leader in the $400 billion global coffee category. And as I said previously, scale matters in coffee. This business will have it. Global Coffee Co. will be the #2 coffee player in the world by revenue and the #1 pure-play operating across 100 countries. It will have a strong portfolio of brands, diversified across formats, across channels. It will have a strong financial profile, $16 billion in net sales and over $3 billion in adjusted EBITDA.\nThe combined entity will have a broader product line than either stand-alone company had, but in particular, relative to Keurig. Prior to the combination, as you see on this first bar, our business was almost exclusively focused on the single-serve subcategory here in North America. But with the addition of JDE Peet's, you now see Global Coffee Co. will have a format mix that's far more closely aligned with the global category split and yet still with a favorable skew to the high-margin single-serve segment and other more value-add areas.\nWhat does that mean? Global Coffee Co. can then fully participate in the growth of the entire category, both in meeting existing consumer preferences and emerging growth opportunities.\nSimilarly, as a true multinational now, Global Coffee Co. will be better positioned to capture a fair share of category growth. At the category level, Coffee has 2 large structural growth drivers. We think both of these are evergreen. The first is per cap consumption growth. This has been and we expect will continue to be a tailwind for the category. It's supported by elements like a rising middle class and ongoing preference shifts, particularly in noncoffee legacy markets, of preferences driven by youth from tea to coffee.\nThe second is premiumization as measured by value per cup. This trend is occurring across all formats. And you see it most evident in the growth of premium solutions like single-serve, but it's occurring across brands as well, with premium trademarks growing faster than mainstream and value. So while per capita consumption is a greater opportunity perhaps in less developed coffee markets and premiumization is a bigger trend in established countries, we actually see significant runway in both of these structural growth drivers.\nThe business will also enjoy unique revenue opportunities arising from this very complementary combination. Let me quickly talk to these 5. Formats. Given the potential to expand Keurig brand equities now into new subcategories, leveraging JDE Peet's full segment exposure. Technology, especially in brewers. Keurig is best-in-class in brewers. We've been an innovation leader. We know how to produce them at an efficient and profitable manner. We can provide insights to some of JDE Peet's systems like Senseo, Tassimo and L'OR.\nChannels. We can capitalize on our complementary footprints, including in away-from-home. Next generation. Next-generation, exciting Keurig Alta and K-Rounds innovation now has the potential to think about expansion beyond North America. And brands, targeting growth opportunities for specific brands in the portfolio, and one I'll call attention to is Peet's, and I'll give you more in a moment. As you see, the center-logistic growth opportunities are ample and indeed global.\nLet me talk a little bit more about Peet's just to bring that to life. We all know that brand, I think, pretty well here in the U.S. It has a rich heritage. It's a coffee pioneer. It's got strong brand awareness premium coffee credentials across the U.S. But as this map shows, the map on the left, its market penetration is very much concentrated in the West Coast, and in particular, California, the home territory.\nAnd its commercial execution at point of buying meaningfully lags Keurig's. But as a combined entity, Global Coffee Co. can utilize Keurig's significant commercial scale, our very strong customer relationships to improve Peet's geographic footprint.\nI'll give you one example with numbers. You see that on the far right. We have the ability to achieve -- well, today, Keurig achieves almost 4 times the feature and display activity of brand Peet's. We can and we will close that gap. The result can be a much larger, faster-growing Peet's premium brand over time.\nSo we've talked about the revenue opportunities, but we also see visible cost synergies at Global Coffee Co. Our $400 million synergy target in the first 3 years span several areas. In procurement, we will benefit from enhanced scale across green coffee sourcing as well as direct and indirect spend pools. In manufacturing and logistics, we have plans for network optimization, for route-to-market consolidation and other go-to-market efficiencies. And for SG&A, we've already identified corporate scale efficiencies as well as IT infrastructure and other system savings.\nImportantly, these synergies have been scoped and we've developed concrete and actionable plans to deliver on these cost synergies, if not exceed them.\nUltimately, we expect Global Coffee Co. will generate consistent, attractive profit growth. This will be driven by a few factors. First, obviously, profitable top line growth. This company will be well positioned to capture its fair share of the coffee category's volume growth, which, as you've heard a couple of times, consistently grows on a volume basis at a low single-digit rate over time. This will obviously generate fixed cost absorption, operating leverage benefits. And in addition to that, the innovation that you've heard about today, our price pack architecture and RGM work, promotional effectiveness, can further translate that top line growth into nice bottom line growth.\nNext, Keurig and JDE Peet's each have robust productivity programs, even beyond the deal synergies I just covered. And obviously, some of these savings will be earmarked for reinvestment, but others will flow through to the bottom line.\nAnd finally, it's not built into our baseline financial outlooks, but it's our belief that current coffee prices are clearly well above the long-term trend, and they do not appear to be supported by market fundamentals. I'm not going to try to predict commodity market gyrations on this stage, but it is worth noting that any normalization in this cost would clearly drive a cyclical profit tailwind.\nBringing these elements together. The business' structural advantages, the potential revenue synergies, the cost synergies of the combination, the other profit levers available to the business, Global Coffee Co. will support an attractive growth algorithm.\nNow there certainly can be some year-to-year volatility in top line due to commodity volatility, but over time, we project low single-digit net sales growth and high single-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we would expect this business to be highly cash generative. As you see on this chart, anticipated cumulative free cash flow of more than $5 billion from '26 to '28.\nWe are excited to create this global coffee powerhouse, the world's largest coffee pure play, and a stable of the best-loved brand powered by advantaged capabilities.\nAll right. I think you've earned a well-deserved break. Let's take a 15-minute break, and we will come back and talk about Beverage Co. Thank you.\n[Break]\n\nChethan Mallela\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nWe're starting in 1 minute. Everyone find your seats.\nPlease welcome Eric Gorli, President of U.S. Refreshment Beverages.\n\nEric Gorli\n\nPresident of U.S. Refreshment Beverages\n\nRight. You all hear me? Excellent. Good morning. Thrilled to be here getting to represent this great business. And most likely, I'm a new face to most of you. Believe it or not, I've actually been in this industry closing in now in 30 years. I spent the first 20 in the [ red system ] and I just hit my tenth year anniversary here at KDP.\nAnd look, as I've told Tim, Bob, our Board, there is absolutely no other place than I'd rather be right now than here with this collection of iconic brands and the incredible team that we've been able to assemble. So let me tell you why I feel that way.\nTim hit some of this to start with. We work in a fantastic industry. It is large, over $300 billion in retail sales. And most importantly, year after year, it has demonstrated the ability to consistently grow sales dollars north of 3%. And what fuels that growth is just how dynamic the consumer and her ever-increasing demands are.\nUnderlying mega trends, these are things we all experience in our day-to-day lives: convenience, wellness, the need for functionality. These fuel the cycle of innovation and the opportunity to continuously participate in new pockets of growth.\nAnd this landscape is way more fragmented than most people realize. We view this as an opportunity for future expansion, particularly with our unique build-buy-partner model.\nSo let's talk a bit about BevCo and why we feel like we are uniquely positioned to be a formidable challenger in this industry. We have scale. We exited 2024, as you saw in Tim's slides, north of $11 billion in net sales. Our business is profitable. Our EBITDA margin is at 30%. And again, importantly, we're growing. Since 2018, we've averaged a top line growth rate of 8%.\nWe have incredible portfolio of brands with incredible organic growth upside. That's going to be most of my presentation today, just the confidence we have in these products. We also have an advantaged commercial and route-to-market model. This includes 1 of only 3 national direct store delivery systems for nonalcoholic beverages here in the U.S. And we've invested significantly in our operations to go support network expansion. And yet, we still have so much room for improvement.\nSo I'll now get into the details on why I personally have so much confidence we can maintain this momentum into the next chapter. So one of the things that is so very special about beverages is just how they are so very personal. These are products where consumers create deep, lifelong relationships with their favorite brands. We have many of these brands inside our portfolio, brands that consumers love, brands that our retailers value.\nSo a few facts and figures. On the slide, you'll see over 25 brands that have over $100 million in annual retail sales. They are led by our $3 billion trademarks, brand Dr Pepper fast approaching the $6 billion mark, as well as category leaders like Canada Dry and Mott's. Some other key brands, you'll see icons like Snapple, A&W, 7UP. As well as a few fast-growing disruptors like Bloom, Ghost and Electrolit. Today, we believe we have a portfolio that not only provides us with exposure to growing categories, but it creates scale for us with our customers and efficiency inside of our operations.\nSo over the past several years, we've done a really nice job of being very thoughtful in how we want to evolve our portfolio. As you heard Tim mention, we employ a flexible but disciplined model that's really centered around building, buying or partnering. It all starts with build. And you can see on the slide where we have demonstrated a really strong track record of bringing innovation. No better example of this than inside of our CSD portfolio. Here we are repeatedly recognized by our retailers for our market-leading innovation.\nWe've also been very purposeful in our approach to utilizing different ways to go expand the portfolio, particularly our partnership model. Our approach of partnerships is very, very unique in the industry. We work hard to ensure that there is a win-win in the relationship, that we have aligned incentives and that both partners are in it for the long term. These partnerships are able to go leverage our DSD network and allow us to rapidly participate in growth pockets with a very capital-efficient model. And in a number of cases, they provide us with a superior risk-adjusted return than we likely could achieve on our own through a build model.\nSo we'll start now with the portfolio with my favorite brand, our flagship brand Dr Pepper. I literally can speak for an hour just on brand Dr Pepper load. It is a brand that has had incredible success and yet we still believe tremendous headroom for growth. A couple of years ago, you heard Tim say Dr Pepper became the #2 most consumed soft drink brand. This year, 2025, we will complete our ninth consecutive year of share growth.\nThis is all built upon a consumer obsession for the brand. You can see that demonstrated in category-leading household penetration growth as well as industry recognition for our marketing campaigns. We believe we have a repeatable playbook that works. It starts with Dr Pepper's unique flavor, its distinct positioning. It plays firmly in wins in what we call the treat demand space. We're able to take that positioning and then make meaningful connections with what consumers really care about and where their passions are. Right now, you can see that on Any Given Saturday come to life in season 8 of our highly successful Fansville campaign.\nWe also leverage winning innovation, innovation that creates excitement not only with our consumers, with our retailers and our distributors. That drives some of the scale retail activation you'll see in market for the full trademark. Importantly, not only for the innovation, this also attracts new households into our base flavor, and we execute this well.\nSo this is great, but what excites me the most is the runway we still have ahead of us. Let me talk about Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, still very much in its early days. You'll see in your scan data, it's already the #2 zero sugar CSD, but still has significant opportunity in terms of distribution, display presence, even consumer awareness. As a percentage of the trademark's mix, we're still only about 60% of the development of the #1 zero sugar CSD.\nPoint number two, Dr Pepper is Gen Z's most popular beverage brand, and we've rapidly been adding households within this cohort. If you are like myself, a student of our industry, you know that this type of trend is highly encouraging for longer-term consumption growth.\nAnd then finally, we have outsized growth opportunities in specific geographies. While we're currently approaching a [ 13 share ] nationally. However, in any given local market, we could be as high as the mid-20s in our heartlands were mid-single digits on the coast. What's really encouraging right now is we are growing share across all market types. In lower-share markets, our innovation has been the most impactful in actually bringing new households into the trademark.\nAnd then final point, as good as the marketing has been on brand Dr Pepper, we honestly believe it can get even better. This year we've begun to leverage some of our new capabilities in precision and personalized marketing. This is now allowing us to go reach target consumers with relevant content in a hyper-efficient approach. We'll speak a little bit more about that in a couple of minutes.\nSo this playbook, we think it's a repeatable model that we can go apply to other parts of our portfolio. And let me just give you 2 quick examples of work in flight today.\nSo Canada Dry, #1 ginger ale, a long track record of growth. Canada Dry plays in the relaxed demand space. It also has a unique and ownable position. Here we've seen innovation also play an important role. Back in 2024, we launched what we call our Fruit Splash platform. That year, it was recognized as the #1 CSD innovation. We're bringing a second flavor in for 2026. And much like brand Dr Pepper, Canada Dry also has geographic opportunities. While it's a 3 share nationally, it's as high as a 12 share here in parts of the Northeast.\nAnd let's take a minute to talk about Mott's. Mott's, #1 apple juice and sauce brand, a staple for moms, incredible equity and health. Here, though, we still have potential for growth. Great example you see on the slide is in our sauce portfolio. Inserting formats like cups and jars, we're north of the 50% share. But we have been a relatively small player in the growing pouch segment. Over the past year, with a focused marketing and commercial activation plan, specifically against pouch, we've been able to unlock significant growth.\nSo I'll let you scan the right-hand side of the slide. You can see a host of other iconic brands within our portfolio that we think we can deploy the same playbook to unlock organic growth. For those of you, probably most of the audience here, local to New York City, you may have noticed Snapple has both a new campaign. And just last week, the return of its iconic glass packaging in 5 classic flavors, honoring the city where it was born and its 5 boroughs.\nSo let me shift gears here, another space I probably consume too much of, but we're excited about as a company, the energy category. Energy now the third largest category in beverages, $28 billion. If you look at the scanner data, growing rapidly. What's really remarkable about energy is just how over the past 2 decades, this category has continued to reinvent itself. It's been able to leverage different product profiles, whether it be ingredients, caffeine amounts, serving sizes, brand positionings. The category has been able to continually unlock additional occasions and bring in new households. Right now we're really seeing the latest iteration of this with the female targeted product lines.\nThree years ago, we rounded honestly to a 0 share in energy. We knew this was a big opportunity. So we set out to go create a portfolio to win where we saw the growth occurring: products with great taste, products that played in the zero sugar space, products that we could target against distinct demand spaces with unique authentic brands. Today we believe we have a complementary portfolio of brands that can win within the respective segments, especially when you couple that with our commercial approach and our national distribution network.\nYou'll see in your scanner data, over the past 4 weeks, we've now surpassed the 7.5 share and we have line of sight to our stated goal of the 10 share in the next few years.\nSo aside from energy, we've also established platforms in several other high-growth categories over the past 2 years. Through our long-term distribution partnership with Electrolit, we now have a strong play in sports hydration, Specifically, we're the #1 player in the rapid hydration segment. This is a $2 billion segment that is growing at a blistering pace.\nThis summer, we entered the probiotic CSD space with Bloom Pop, building on Bloom's incredible success to date in energy. In its launch retailer, velocity per SKU was on par with the market leaders. We're really excited about Bloom Pop's potential, and we just began scaling this nationally at the end of Q3 through our DSD network.\nAnd then finally, earlier this summer, we had an acquisition, a company called Dyla Brands, which has allowed us to go play in the drink mix space. Dyla is bringing both brands as well as capabilities. Additionally, it's going to let our broader portfolio to instantly access this high-growth and attractive functional powder segment.\nSo a lot of effort has gone into building this portfolio. However, entering a category is one thing, the bigger question, can you effectively sustain the success? And you can see on the slide, across a variety of time horizons in a spectrum of categories how we have been able to significantly increase our market share relative to pre-KDP distribution. This reinforces that access to our network. It's more than distribution. It's our ability to step-change the selling and activation for a brand, all the way from the national buying desk down to the outlet level.\nSo part of the secret, whether it's successful innovation or some of the partnership scaling I just spoke about, are some of the top-tier capabilities that we've been able to create in our marketing and commercial functions. I mentioned earlier, with brand Dr Pepper, my excitement around our new capabilities to go amplify what we already believe is world-class marketing. This is all grounded in new abilities to go leverage AI-powered data and analytics to go create a deeper understanding of the consumer. This helps us guide our innovation, it's helping us set brand strategy, and now it's also allowing us to create highly relevant, personalized content and creative.\nOur marketing and communication platforms are increasingly connected across both channels and platforms. This is going to let us unlock precision media capabilities, allowing us to go target the individual and drive efficiency and effectiveness in how we flight our marketing investments. Right now at KDP, we think we have access to the right data, the right systems and, most importantly, the right talent, underpinned by an agile operating model to measure and react almost real time to ensure we're driving the best returns for our marketing investments. This fall, we started to go deploy this with our Fansville campaign. You're going to hear us talk a lot more about this in the future.\nAnd then an area that I've spent a great deal of my time helping to go build out is the middle part of the slide, is what we call our commercial engine. So this is the function which really serves as the critical link between our brands, and ultimately, our routes to market. So inside the gears of the engine, you see some of the best-in-breed capabilities we've created. It could be omni-marketing, revenue management, category management, how we show up with our customers.\nThese are capabilities that allow us to effectively represent our products with our customers with a high degree of confidence in the ability to go create value. The advantage of us doing this well, so regardless of the brand owner or the route to market, is we can create a seamless experience for our retailers, bring them meaningful commercial solutions that can fully take advantage of the breadth of what our portfolio has to offer.\nAnd then final point on the slide, we all know it, strong national distribution, absolutely critical to go win in beverages. Right now, we have 6 different options that we can go use and it really depends on what is the right fit for the product or what is the need of the retailer. So let me speak a bit more about those options.\nSo I'll talk more about company-owned DSD. We have it both here in the U.S. and in Mexico. But we also are able to go leverage some leading bottlers that complement our company-owned DSD footprint in specific geographies. For some products, we still utilize the effect of warehouse direct model, particularly for categories that have lower velocities or where there's a real preference by the retailer for that mode.\nFountain, foodservice and on-premise, extremely important. These channels provide access to high-value away-from-home occasions. These are critical for building brands. Notable, brand Dr Pepper is the most pervasively available fountain beverage. This allows us to go have direct relationships with most major operators and customers in the food service space.\nAnd finally, winning in e-comm has become increasingly important. By our measures today, roughly 1 in 8 cold beverages, the purchases are occurring in a digitally oriented means. And in many categories and retailers, it's providing over 100% of the growth. We are making the right investments to ensure we've got the specialized capabilities to effectively partner for growth, whether it's a pure play or our omnichannel retailers.\nSo let's talk a bit more about DSD. Why does it matter so much for beverages? Well, when you get into it, great DSD execution is more than just a replenishment model. Done well, it is a powerful competitive advantage that allows you to build brands over time. DSD provides access to outlets that are not serviced by warehouse direct. Most of the convenience retail channel, most of on-premise cannot get there with that DSD.\nAnd even within retail channels, it allows a local selling associate to build a meaningful relationship with decision makers at the outlet level. These relationships, coupled with the merchandising resources we provide, can translate into a superior retail presence for our brands as well as getting you critical access to cold drink equipment and other means of trial.\nScale is what makes a DSD system work. To generate the local brand building benefits, there is significant labor in fixed cost. Scale drives a virtuous cycle that benefits from the leverage on that infrastructure. And done well, it enables further reinvestment in growth.\nSo let me orient you to our DSD network. These are the trucks that carry the majority of our portfolio. Again, we have 1 of only 3 systems that can cover the entirety of the U.S. footprint. Our company-owned trucks, they're depicted in the maroon on the slide, they cover roughly 80% of the population base. And for the balance of the country, we have long-standing, strong strategic relationships with leading independent distributors who operate with scale in their own respective geographies.\nLook, I've had the chance over the past few years to spend a great deal of time with some of the 13,000 DSD employees that we have. When you get a chance to experience the passion these team members have for our brands, the expertise they bring to our customers every day, hitting almost 200,000 outlets, you can see firsthand why this is such a powerful competitive advantage.\nSo we're really proud over the past 6 years of the work we've done to go strengthen our DSD network. Look, we're improving every day in terms of both the service, the capabilities that we're providing our retailers. So when we talk about each of these vectors, we'll start with territories.\nSince 2019, as Tim mentioned, we've made over 30 acquisitions, some relatively modest, a few rather large. What's universal though is where we made these investments, we've been very satisfied with the returns that they've generated. That said, there is not a one-size-fits-all model here. Our primary goal is to have a scaled and relevant DSD operation that puts the right focus on our brands. Whether it's a partner or something we own, access is what is key.\nLet me shift to portfolio. One of the goals of our portfolio expansion has actually to go help us generate additional scale for our company-owned DSD operations, meaningful participation in categories like energy or sports hydration. They've had a material impact within specific channels. No better example than inside of convenience retail. Here we've been able to improve our drop sizes close to 70%, and in some instances, have had the opportunity to go revisit our service frequency to go map better to some of our customers' needs. Again, a great example of that virtuous flywheel I spoke about a moment ago and how we can strengthen our ability to go capture growth, particularly in C-stores, which is an extremely profitable space.\nSo a final point on the slide is going to reference some of our digital capabilities. These here are really focused on our frontline selling. We're rolling these out recently in the market, really pleased with the results.\nThe one I'll highlight is our Perfect Order. This is an application that's leveraging algorithms based on outlet specific data to help regenerate the order for the next delivery. And just to bring this home, if you think about a big-box store, generally a couple of hundred thousand square feet, we may have 250 different SKUs spread across that store that a sales associate is responsible providing the next delivery order for. Where we've been able to deploy this application, we're seeing meaningful improvement in in-stock rates as well as a significant reduction in the time it takes spent on lower-value activities, [ in ] counting, walking around the outlet. So with that additional time, we can enable these same individuals to shift their focus to local selling activities.\nHere we're also implementing real-time access to outlet specific data. We're starting to enable with AI to help generate specific insights. That's going to help aid in their ability to work with a local customer decision maker to unlock growth inside of that outlet. Extremely excited about where this is going to go.\nSo shift gears a minute, let's talk about Mexico. We also have the fast-growing, profitable $1 billion-plus business in Mexico. Though it's at an earlier stage, we think the same model that has driven success in the U.S. also can be leveraged here. We have the leading brands. Starts with our flagship, brand Peñafiel. If you're not familiar with brand Peñafiel, it's a 100-year-old locally sourced icon that is the #1 mineral water in Mexico. We're now seeing that brand have success moving into some adjacent spaces.\nWe also believe some of our U.S. trademarks can play a much bigger role in the Mexican market, particularly brand Dr Pepper. Finally, like the U.S., we continue to make meaningful investments in expanding our DSD network. Much like the U.S., for Mexico, a critical enabler of brand development, particularly in a market where the traditional trade is still thriving. Today our company-owned footprint, we reach about half of the marketplace, we cover population centers in the central and northern part of the country. All of this together is why we feel great about our ability to go generate strong returns from Mexico for many years to come.\nSo spoken a lot about growth. I also want to emphasize, though, we are focused on the right kind of growth, growth that's going to allow us to go expand our margins over time. Pricing, a critical lever. We are very well positioned to drive sustained net price realization across our major categories.\nAnother key thing is our largest category, CSDs, we still believe has a very, very attractive price-to-value ratio, particularly when you compare that to other beverage options per purchase.\nLet's talk about mix management. We have very strong revenue management capabilities. Done well, we're able to go meet both some affordability requirements, but also identify different levers to improve our unit economics, whether it's through promotional optimization or package and product mix. I highlighted the virtuous cycle in convenience stores. The ability to continue to grow immediate consumption soft drink and [indiscernible] as well as energy, these are really profitable levers to continue to go get great margin accretive mix in your portfolio.\nAnd then finally, I'll touch on productivity. We all know productivity, it supports reinvestment back into the brands, ideally can help expand margins. Annually, we target 3 to 4 points of productivity, and we've been able to consistently deliver in that range over the past few years. Specific focus areas where we have made and we'll continue to make investments are in our network, both within our manufacturing and our distribution facilities. We've got opportunities to further leverage automation and optimize our footprint.\nDigital, I spoke a lot about frontline a few moments ago. We also have digital initiatives in flight to help step-change our demand and supply planning visibility across the vast network.\nAnd then finally, operating model. We're continuing to strengthen how we manage this productivity pipeline, increasingly driving accountability down to our local orbits.\nSo when you bring it all together, BevCo has delivered consistent strong financial results. Since 2018, on a compounded and annual basis, top line growth approaching 8%, EBITDA growth almost 12%. And look, we've achieved these outcomes through what I covered today, strong base business momentum and share gains; deliberate, capital-efficient portfolio reshaping initiatives; and targeted actions, which were able to mitigate inflation and help us go reinvest back against the core tenets of our business.\nAnd we expect to sustain this momentum that supports the algorithm you'll see up on the page: mid-single-digit net sales growth and high single-digit adjusted EPS growth. Additionally, we expect to generate significant free cash flow, which will, as Tim mentioned, provide optionality for us to either invest against organic or potentially inorganic additional growth levers.\nSo a few points to reiterate as I close here. This is a powerful platform in a fantastic industry. Over the past 6 years, this team has proven its ability to consistently deliver attractive financial returns. We now head into the future we're equipped with a fortified portfolio, the right brands, the exposure to high-growth demand spaces, which we believe can meet our growth goals organically.\nAdditionally, we're poised to benefit from a step change in our new digitally enabled marketing capabilities. We have a model against our portfolio that creates optionality against how we can add to the portfolio in a very capital-efficient manner. We are strengthening our network, and we're going to continue to recognize the benefits of improved execution. These improvements will drive growth in margin-accretive categories, packages and channels.\nAnd then finally, we have demonstrated the ability to unlock meaningful productivity. And we believe we have a robust pipeline of opportunities to come.\nSo as you assess the some of these efforts, I think now, hopefully, you can understand why I have so much confidence in this team. And as we head into the next chapter for BevCo, confidence about our future and our ability to go deliver this very attractive algorithm we have up on the page.\nThank you guys so much for your attention this morning. I'm now going to turn the podium over to Jane.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives",
    "content3": "[Audio Gap]\nIndependent company remain the same as we outlined in August. For Beverage Co, that includes an outlook of mid-single-digit net sales growth and high single-digit adjusted EPS growth. And for Global Coffee Co., we envision an outlook and long-term targets consistent with low single-digit net sales growth and high single-digit EPS growth. These will be strongly cash flow generative businesses, with BevCo projected to generate over $6 billion of cash flow -- free cash flow over the next 3 years and Global Coffee Co. set to produce more than $5 billion.\nWhile the exact dividend at each company will be determined closer to separation, what we can commit to today is that, across the 2, we'll maintain the level of our current dividend to start.\nAnd we also come to you today with a clear view of starting that leverage for each stand-alone company. Upon separation, we expect Beverage Co. to have net leverage between 3.5 and 4x, with Global Coffee Co. targeted between 3.75 and 4.25x. Of course, both companies will continue to delever and strengthen their balance sheets following the separation as we keep to a commitment to strong investment-grade profiles.\nLet's zoom in on each company in a little bit more detail, and this will build on the remarks of my colleagues. For Beverage Co., the financial algorithm and capital structure that we've laid out are carefully designed to enable its growth potential, its growth strategy and continued outperformance. As you just heard from Eric, our Refreshment Beverage business has already proven itself to be an agile challenger in North American beverages, and we fully intend to build on this standing with long-term targets that reflect that.\nMultiple factors are expected to contribute to mid-single-digit net sales growth. Over the last several years, we have worked really hard to evolve our portfolio mix towards a faster-growing weighted category average, which now features a well-balanced set of volume, mix and price drivers. On top of that, we layer a proven track record of market share gains supported by strong innovation and commercial capabilities. And in addition, our ability to enter white spaces and activate capital-efficient partnerships now and in the future -- they're [ attacked ], which means further growth optionality as we move through this period of integration and then afterwards during the -- after the separation.\nSo combined with operating margin upside and some below-the-line leverage, what becomes clear is the path to high single-digit EPS growth for the Beverage Co. And to facilitate this, we expect the capital structure at separation will be only modestly above where KDP's would have been prior to the deal, with cash flow to delever quickly thereafter.\nSeparately, we will optimize Global Coffee Co. for more resilient growth and strong cash flows. What that means is our vision remains to create a pure-play cash-generative global coffee company. How does that manifest financially? A combination of low single-digit net sales growth over time with some volatility up and down over the course of commodity cycles due to pricing pass-through dynamics and high single-digit EPS growth, thanks to a combination of actionable cost synergies, continuous productivity and below-the-line leverage. This combination should drive more steadily growing cash flow with upward potential should the coffee price normalize from here.\nAnd for Global Coffee Co. too, what we want is a balanced capital structure out of the gate, which means net leverage likely between 3.75 and 4.25x at separation.\nSo you now kind of better understand the financial vision, and I'd like to shift the discussion to how we get there. Over the last several weeks, we set out to optimize our acquisition financing mix with 2 objectives. The first was to lower leverage at acquisition close, and the second was to establish a clear line of sight to solid capital structures for each of the individual separated companies. That process successfully culminated in today's announcement of a combined $7 billion strategic equity investment anchored by 2 leading global investment firms, Apollo and KKR.\nI would highlight several benefits to the revised financing package. One, we will, in fact, reinforce our investment-grade profile as a combined company with net leverage at close now approximately 1 turn lower than our original plan entailed. Secondly, we will have greater visibility to investment grade-worthy capital structures for each independent company akin to what I just described. And even though the new capital is equity-like, it comes with a reasonable cost while pairing us up with world-class investors who see the strength of the opportunity at KDP and its successor companies.\nAll in, against the backdrop of more comfortable leverage and attractive year 1 EPS accretion of approximately 10%, we hope this update will allow the strategic logic and value of the deal to take center stage in your evaluation.\nLet's take a closer look at the structure of the deal. Under our previously announced plan, assuming a June 2026 close, net leverage at 2026 year-end was projected in the low 5s. What that meant was a starting point at close that would have been at approximately 5.6x. After today, we expect initial leverage at close to be in the mid-4s. And from there, we plan to delever at roughly 0.5 turn a year, thanks to a strong focus on cash flow.\nThe new investments will allow us to replace the full balance of junior subordinated notes and a smaller portion of senior debt that were originally intended to be part of the financing package. And all in, the weighted average cost of capital of the deal is expected to be only modestly higher than original plan.\nThe new instruments we've stood up take 2 forms. Let's start with the creation of a new Global Coffee Co. joint venture with a consortium of investors led by Apollo and KKR. The JV will focus on single-serve manufacturing in North America, with the earnings from pod manufacturing to be split among the partners, including KDP. In fact, KDP will retain a controlling interest in the JV as well as operational control of the assets. And in establishing the JV, we'll receive $4 billion in total proceeds at a cost of capital of just above 7%, in a 7.3% to 7.4% range, an addition projected.\nIn addition, KKR and Apollo have made a strategic investment into KDP and, ultimately, the Beverage Co., yielding $3 billion of incremental capital.\nThe second instrument is an attractively priced convertible security. It features a preferred dividend of 4.75% to be netted against any common dividends. And the conversion price is 37.25. That's a 6% premium to where KDP last traded prior to the announcement of the acquisition, an outcome that speaks to the upside potential we all see here. I should mention that we plan to offer our shareholder partners an opportunity to participate in this financing.\nTo help with your modeling, you'll find a page in the appendix that outlines the accounting implications of each instrument. And when you run your models, what you'll see is that we've been able to effectively drive leverage lower while making a manageable trade-off in terms of accretion and cost of capital. Based on your feedback, which informed our decisions over the last several weeks, we believe this is a more optimal balance to strike.\nAs Tim said, ensuring solid balance sheets for each company is one of the critical milestones towards a successful separation, and we expect to be operationally ready to go by year-end 2026. In the meantime, our job will be to focus on EBITDA growth and cash flow generation to facilitate that time line.\nHowever, should we want to further accelerate the deleveraging path, there are other levers that we could employ to raise additional capital. For instance, we might consider monetizing select noncore minority stakes and nonstrategic brand assets. And we may also evaluate a partial IPO of Beverage Co. to begin the separation process, which could raise additional primary proceeds.\nTo be clear, these are simply options for us to consider. The only concrete commitment on this page and on this stage is the strong free cash flow generation to support our transformational vision of the future.\nAnd speaking of commitments, we recognize we have come to you with quite a bit of news today and we're focused on supporting your full understanding. So of all the messages I hope you'll take away from my presentation, it's the following.\nWe will ensure an appropriate capital structure for KDP at transaction close as well as each individual company at separation and beyond. Our focus is on strong cash flow to support deleveraging as well as maintaining our competitive and attractive dividend. Through all of this, our unwavering goal is to set Beverage Co. and Global Coffee Co. up for financial success and operational success. And as we do so, we will stay consistent and transparent in our financial communications to help build and maintain your confidence.\nWith that, thank you very much, and I'll pass it on to Roger Johnson.\n\nRoger Johnson\n\nChief Supply Chain Officer\n\nOkay. My name is Roger Johnson. And I have the privilege of being the Chief Transformation Officer and Chief Supply Chain Officer here at Keurig Dr Pepper. And in my capacity of Chief Transformation Officer, I am responsible for the integration of JDE Peet's into KDP and then the subsequent separation into Global Coffee Company and Beverage Company. So I'd like to take a few minutes today to just walk through our approach and the execution of the transformation and maybe give you some more details of how we're approaching the work in front of us.\nFirst off, we are genuinely excited about the opportunities ahead for both stand-alone companies. And as Bob and Tim mentioned earlier, we have strong support and oversight from our Board of Directors and the especially created Transaction Committee. To guide this transformation, we've established an executive steering committee that meets weekly to provide critical oversight and timely strategic direction. We've also added rigor through a Transformation Management Office or our TMO, which is focused on capturing synergies and driving growth opportunities.\nTo keep everyone focused, we've named a dedicated internal TMO team to lead these initiatives, allowing most of our teams to continue driving base business momentum. This process is fostering strong communication between JDE Peet's and KDP leadership as well as our both internal functional experts.\nAnd to ensure success, we've partnered with outside advisers who bring deep experience in integrations and complex transactions, and they are long-standing relationships both for us and JDE Peet's, which means we can leverage their detailed knowledge of our collective businesses and their proven expertise from hundreds of similar processes across industries worldwide.\nLet me add some more context in the scope of our Transformation Management Office. We've fully stood up critical work streams focused on objectives of integration planning, future company designs, separation, synergy value capture and spin readiness. For both Global Coffee Company and Beverage Company, these efforts have been mobilized in collaborative but discrete work streams.\nWe've organized these objectives into 3 primary focus areas for execution. First and foremost, change management. We're engaging the hearts and minds of our organizations, showcasing future opportunities and creating that winning culture as we move towards stand-alone success. In commercial and supply chain, we're leveraging this unique moment to optimize and unlock growth and the potential across marketing, selling organizations and key go-to-market opportunities. And then finally, for enterprise functions, we are focused on building fit-for-purpose teams, calibrated to each company's unique needs and scale, ensuring both organizations have the strength and agility to succeed.\nAs we fully mobilize the TMO, I've seen fantastic collaboration across our teams in these early days. It's really inspiring to watch our leaders really lean in to the road ahead. Together we've shifted into the next gear and planning against key milestones.\nFirst of all, I'd say we're focused on integration planning following the acquisition close with detailed action plans to capture synergies. And we're also accelerating readiness work, developing future company operating models for both Global Coffee Company and Beverage Company and getting into the functional specific preparation required for success.\nSecondly, we're deep into separation planning to ensure clean operational readiness for 2 world-class public companies. Our goal is to be ready to separate by year-end 2026. And that means everything within our control will be stood up and ready by then.\nAs Tim mentioned earlier, the actual timing will depend on achievement of multiple milestones, including our own. But our commitment is clear: secure operational readiness is early and as robustly as possible while actively capturing cost synergies. And our goal is clear: to build a global coffee powerhouse and the most agile North American beverage leader. This transformation approach will make that vision a reality.\nTo make sure both stand-alone organizations reach their full potential, we've placed a heavy focus on communications and change management. Recently, we had the chance to spend meaningful time with the JDE Peet's team on International Coffee Day, very fitting. And it was a fantastic event in Amsterdam, where we shared our vision, answered questions and amplified the excitement across both teams. A shared love of coffee brought the teams together and really gave everyone, including myself, a glimpse of what a true coffee powerhouse could feel like.\nAt the same time, we launched aligned communications approaches, high-frequency town halls, feedback loops, multichannel digital outreach, both internally and externally. And this really ensures we're reaching every employee and engaging top leadership, including our director and above populations.\nFor many, this is the first time in their careers they've experienced a transformation of this scale, and enrolling them in the journey is an exciting opportunity. To reinforce collaboration, we've shared clear guiding principles and leadership commitments on how we will work together for the outstanding outcomes we expect. We believe a consistent drumbeat of communication is critical to a seamless integration and eventual separation without missing a beat.\nSo far, employee feedback has been very positive, especially around leadership transparency, communication depth and the opportunities ahead of us. And I can tell you firsthand, from Amsterdam, Frisco, Burlington, all over, our colleagues are energized about the future potential of these 2 great companies.\nAs mentioned earlier, our coffee company value capture plan, about $400 million, is well underway with opportunities across procurement, manufacturing and SG&A and IT. This target has been validated through both top-down and detailed bottoms-up planning, and we see it as highly actionable. As Tim highlighted, these efficiencies are balanced across the 3 major buckets of procurement, manufacturing and logistics, SG&A and IT. And ahead of close, we've established clean teams to ensure that work can happen outside the day-to-day business, so we can move quickly once the acquisition closes.\nImmediately after close, we'll activate each functional focus area to deliver on our 3-year synergy capture plan. And we're confident these cost synergies, combined with future growth opportunities, will set Global Coffee Company up for long-term success.\nAnd our job to do the same for Beverage Company, minimizing dis-synergies before and after separation. We expect that impact to be approximately $75 million, and we largely plan to offset it. That means we got to redesign organizations and spend structures with agility in mind, keeping any leakage manageable within the Beverage Company's overall P&L.\nI hope you can see and feel my excitement and confidence in our ability to land the right structure, build 2 successful companies and create value for everyone throughout this transformation. So thank you for your time and engagement. I'm going to turn it over back to Tim to give a Q3 earnings update. Thank you.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nAll right. We are coming down the home stretch. Thank you, Roger. Look, one of the main objectives, obviously, in establishing that TMO is not only to do the hard work around separation -- integration separation, but importantly, to minimize the disruption of that activity so that our core teams can focus and deliver on the base business quarter after quarter.\nAnd I think our Q3 results that you've probably already seen in the press release are a testament to this approach. We continue to operate with focus, with discipline. We delivered another strong quarter here in Q3 even with that tough macroeconomic backdrop.\nSo let me share some highlights on the quarter. Net sales accelerated in Q3. They accelerated sequentially. They increased at a double-digit rate, with strengthening performance across all 3 of our reported segments. We gained market share in key categories like CSDs and energy. We successfully implemented another round of pricing on our coffee business. And in international, we drove healthy relative trends among challenging macro conditions.\nSo as you've heard throughout the morning, we are advancing a lot of exciting initiatives right now at KDP across both Refreshment Beverage and Coffee. And these are, as evidenced in the results, really contributing to this near-term performance and, I think, continued momentum.\nHaving said that, as expected, inflationary pressures ramped during Q3. And even despite this, we delivered solid bottom line growth and generated meaningful cash flow in the third quarter.\nSo with 1 quarter remaining in the year, as you've heard, we are raising our constant currency net sales outlook and reaffirming our EPS growth guidance. We're confident that our robust commercial plans, our innovation plans, our operating rigor will help us achieve these updated targets and finish 2025 on a strong note.\nSo let's move to the consolidated results. You see it on this slide. Net sales specifically grew 10.6%, led by about a 6.5% increase in volume mix, with strong results in U.S. Ref Bev and international.\nThe Ghost integration continues to perform very well. It's meeting all of our key metrics that we set out and delivering on year 1 of our investment thesis. It's contributed 4.4 points to the top line.\nNet price increased 4.2%, primarily that's reflecting the pricing actions we took on our Coffee business in response to, obviously, [indiscernible] price inflation.\nOn the bottom line, operating income increased roughly 4%. Net sales growth, productivity savings were partially offset by that inflationary pressure I referenced. All in, EPS grew 6% to $0.54, and that included a modest below-the-line benefit from a minority partnership gain.\nOkay. Let's do a quick tour of the 3 reported segments, starting with Refreshment Beverage. We maintained what I'd characterize as exceptional momentum on this business, with net sales growing 14.5% driven by volume mix increase of over 11%. Net price was also a driver; it added about 3 points to net sales. Ghost clearly was a strong contributor to our growth, but also our base business. In fact, our base business accelerated in Q3, increasing in the high single digits, led by CSDs, energy, sports hydration.\nOverall, the segment results in Ref Bev were prepared by that growth playbook that Eric took you through just a few minutes ago. Brand building, innovation, commercial execution each contributing to the strong performance you see. And we see significant runway for future growth in Ref Bev, and we have strong plans in place going into '26 to ensure we deliver on that momentum.\nWhat about segment operating income? You see it grew 10% and with net sales gains and ongoing productivity savings more than offsetting the impacts of inflation as well as lapping earned equity gains that were larger in the prior year.\nLet's shift to U.S. Coffee. In U.S. Coffee, we continued our recovery trend. We drove modest growth in both the top and bottom line. Net sales increased 1.5%. Net price realization was 5.5% as we implemented additional pricing actions on our pods business and our brewers business in response to inflation. This was obviously partially offset by a volume mix decline of about 4 points, primarily driven by lower brewer shipments. And I will tell you, during the quarter, retailers are continuing to manage brewer inventory very tightly, and there's some adjustment to the recent price increases by consumers. Pod shipments also declined, but more modestly, and the elasticities are remaining quite manageable and within our overall expectation.\nOverall, the coffee category remains resilient in our view relative to the significant increase in input costs, and we're also seeing improvements in our own business. Admittedly, the commodity backdrop is difficult and price overall is driving our top line.\nOlivier told you earlier, we're actively advancing robust innovation plans. He covered many of them: marketing plans, driving more brewer sales, some exciting news going into '26 with Keurig Coffee Collective and beyond. And overall, we would say while pod shipments declined, we feel good about what we're seeing from an elasticity standpoint.\nLet's talk about segment operating income. It grew about 2.5%, with pricing and cost savings more than offsetting inflationary pressures. We're improved by -- we're -- sorry, we're encouraged by the improved trajectory on the bottom line, but we do expect impact from green coffee inflation and tariffs to build into the fourth quarter.\nAll right. Now international. Net sales grew 10% in constant currency. That's a 6% increase in net price, a 4% increase in volume mix. Results reflected strong relative performance in Mexico, despite what you know our widely reported macro challenges as well as the pricing-led growth in our Canadian coffee business.\nInternational operating income declined about 4%, primarily reflecting the impact of inflationary pressures as well as a tough year-ago comparison. This was partially offset by the strong top line growth that I referenced in productivity savings. Overall, in international, I would tell you, we continue to see significant potential for this segment to have outsized top and bottom line contribution over time.\nThese Q3 results also underscored the cash generative nature of our business. Free cash flow was more than $500 million in the quarter, bringing that year-to-date total to $955 million. But importantly, and you see it in this box, this year-to-date figure includes the unfavorable onetime impact of the $225 million Ghost distribution payment that we made in Q1 as we acquired this business and took over distribution. Obviously, excluding the impact of this one-timer, we would have generated more than $1.1 billion in free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, representing obviously a sizable step-up from last year.\nLooking ahead, you've heard us say it and Jane mentioned it, we expect strong cash generation, both in Q4, obviously, and a full year basis, and in the years to come, which will help support those deleveraging goals that Jane shared with you earlier.\nAll right. Let's move to guidance. Three quarters of the year behind us, we are raising our constant currency net sales outlook to high single digit from mid-single digit previously. We're also reaffirming and remain on track to deliver [ HSD ] EPS growth guidance.\nWe recognize that the environment remains dynamic, especially when you think about tariffs, the building inflationary impacts. But we've got the innovation, we've got the commercial plans, we've got execution in a great place as well as disciplined expense management. And all of that for us means we can continue to deliver on our guidance and for our shareholders.\nAll right. Let's wrap this up and then we'll go to a break before Q&A.\nSo we've reviewed the strong Q3 results. I want to now come back to the 4 questions I put up right when I took the stage this morning. And I think over the last couple of hours, I hope you'd agree, we provided meaningful updates and further details on our transformative value creation plans. Let's go back to these 4 questions.\nFirst, why the acquisition? Because after careful consideration, we concluded that the acquisition of JDE Peet's is a unique opportunity to strengthen our coffee business by adding substantial, complementary global scale. This combination will catalyze meaningful revenue opportunities, cost synergies and, in turn, drive strong financial delivery and sustainable competitive advantage.\nSecond question, why separate at all? You have the option to run it as a combined company. Because we believe in the power of focus. We believe strong and distinct cultural identities at Global Coffee Co. and Beverage Co. can create even greater alignment and more purposeful action. And we believe that strategic optionality should be more available and accessible to each business as a standalone.\nThird question, how do we tailor our capital structures to enable these outcomes? By making revisions. We've solved for a more comfortable leverage at acquisition close with a different and attractive financing mix. And we've enhanced visibility to 2 properly calibrated balance sheets for each of these independent companies.\nAnd finally, how do we ensure success? By focusing on milestones rather than dates. By putting the right processes in place to achieve those milestones. And by appointing the right leaders with the right experience to drive towards those goals.\nAll right. Let me wrap it up by stating the obvious, and it's on this slide. We are truly just getting started. The market reaction after August 25 was not what we hoped for. But I can tell you the reaction from our other stakeholders, including commercial partners, customers, KDP employees and future colleagues at JDE Peet's have all been strongly positive. We've given folks a very inspiring destination and they're ready to go.\nWe're excited about this future transformation as well. But I also want to be clear, we're not in a rush. We are making a big bet because we see enormous potential, and we're going to be highly deliberate in how we go about unlocking it. I hope you sense that after today.\nOur management team, our Board of Directors see a tremendous amount of value creation opportunity from this 2-step transaction, and we will not rest until we get that done.\nSo as you heard today, this was a slide Bob started with, we do have a consistent and proven track record of creating value in beverages. We create vibrant businesses through a playbook that works. We have deep insights that underpin our conviction in this deal. And we have a clear plan to deliver on its promise. At the same time, we're listening and we are adjusting as and when needed. And this leadership team has the confidence, it has the experience to successfully carry out this transaction. But we also have the wisdom, we have the willingness to stay flexible in our approach.\nAgain, I hope you've seen that today. And you will continue to see that as we chart our course to establishing North America's most agile beverage challenger and a true global coffee powerhouse.\nThank you for your time. Those of you that are here with us at NASDAQ, we're going to take a break before we come back for Q&A. I again encourage you to take full advantage of these fabulous beverage stations. And those that are joining verbally, we are going to -- or sorry, virtually, we are going to come back at 12:15 East Time. Thank you very much.\n[Break]"

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of 2025. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Jane Gelfand, Senior Vice President, Finance at Keurig Dr Pepper. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives\n\nThank you, and [indiscernible]. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our second quarter results, which we will discuss during this conference call. An accompanying slide presentation can be viewed in real time on the live webcast.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements which reflect KDP's judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today.\nFor more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and the latest 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC later today. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q2 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings materials.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr Pepper's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. I'll now turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong second quarter results, closing out a very good first half of the year. Our resilient performance is testament to our advantaged business model, execution and agility while operating in a dynamic environment. Looking ahead, the balance of 2025 will present challenges in the form of rising cost pressures, including from tariffs that remain highly fluid as well as continued consumer caution. Despite this, we remain on track to achieve our full year outlook, thanks to strong first half delivery and well calibrated back half plans. .\nWhile driving hard to deliver on our 2025 commitments, we continue to advance KDP's long-term value creation strategy. As a reminder, our strategic road map is focused in 5 areas. Our entire organization is galvanized around these goals with forward progress being made each quarter. Let me share some examples from Q2. Starting with consumer-obsessed brand building. In June, we published KDP's inaugural State of Beverages trend report, reinforcing our thought leadership in the beverage industry.\nDrawn from national surveys and our own proprietary data this insight-rich report underscores the important role beverages play in consumers' lives and how evolving preferences are shaping demand. With consumers' ever-changing needs at the heart of everything we do, it's no surprise that this report captures many of the trends we have been actioning against. For instance, we know that nearly half of all Americans and almost 3/4 of Gen Z consumers try a new beverage every month. This year, we are satisfying their thirst and curiosity through a robust flavor-oriented innovation slate in carbonated soft drinks, which has been highly successful to date.\nIn fact, Dr. Pepper Blackberry ranks as the #1 new product in the category this year. While iconic 7UP is enjoying renewed momentum on the back of winning flavors like tropical as well as a refreshing endless summer limited time offering.\nOur second pillar is reshaping our now and next portfolio, and we continue to increase our exposure to attractive white spaces. Energy is a major focus for us. and I'll speak more about our early success in that category in a moment, but we have also made exciting progress in other adjacencies.\nIn sports hydration, electrolyte is the fastest-growing scaled brand in the category, benefiting from strong velocities, DSD enabled distribution expansion and product and packaging innovation. The brand registered over 30% retail sales growth and gained more than 1.5 points of share in Q2, yet has still only scratched the surface of its potential. We're also beginning to build a presence in new categories and segments.\nDuring the second quarter, we took 100% ownership of Dilo brands, a key player in powdered drink mixes and liquid water enhancers. This small tuck-in builds on our productive multiyear partnership as a minority investor. Now with full ownership, we will leverage [indiscernible] know-how and capabilities to expand our presence in an attractive and growing category, including by extending more KDP brands into the space.\nPrebiotics CSDs are another fast-growing area of interest, having quickly captured nearly 3% market share of the $46 billion carbonated soft drink category. In Q3, we're entering this subsegment with the launch of Bloom pop, a great tasting soda combining bold bubbly flavor with gut health benefits. This launch builds on our successful energy partnership with Bloom, which has rapidly scaled to nearly a share point in energy drinks and has strong crossover potential into prebiotic CSDs.\nConsistent with our third strategic pillar, we are amplifying our route-to-market advantage, particularly in DSD. This starts with investing in our existing system, including through enhanced digital tools, and continues with selected network expansion opportunities. Last year, we acquired bottling and distribution operations in Arizona and I'm pleased with the high standard of execution that our teams have brought to this important geography. And later this year, we are capitalizing on a unique opportunity to add Dr. Pepper to our DSD portfolio in critical parts of California and Nevada as well as certain areas in the Midwest.\nOur teams are actively preparing for this transition, which will enable us to directly influence point-of-sale trends, drive greater efficiencies across our DSD network and generate halo effects that benefit our other DSD brands. Our focus on generating fuel for growth is ongoing and has taken on even more importance in the current inflationary environment. We have a robust productivity program that delivered strong efficiencies in Q2, and we remain on track to achieve the high end of our 3% to 4% savings target this year.\nWe also continue to manage overhead costs with discipline as was evident in our quarterly results. And finally, our capital allocation approach remains balanced and dynamic. During the second quarter, we generated strong free cash flow and fortified our balance sheet by refinancing a portion of our debt.\nMoving to Q2 results. We delivered strong enterprise growth with net sales increasing 7%. Growth included contributions from both price and volume mix reflected continued momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and International segments and illustrated encouraging sequential progress in coffee. We managed operating expenses with discipline, protecting our margins and helping to translate our top line gains into double-digit EPS growth.\nLet's dive deeper into the segments and begin with U.S. refreshment beverages. Net sales grew almost 11% in the quarter, driven by a combination of core strength and rapid expansion in recently entered white spaces. Starting with the core, our CSD performance was strong, and we again gained market share in a growing category led by Dr. Pepper as well as 7UP and Canada Dry. When it comes to Dr Pepper, our multiyear momentum is underpinned by many sustainable growth drivers, some of which were apparent in Q2.\nThese include innovation and renovation with Dr. Pepper Blackberry proving highly incremental to the franchise and our recent graphics refresh for Dr. Pepper Cherry, driving a meaningful acceleration in sales growth, velocity and buyers. Distribution and merchandising, particularly in Dr Pepper Zero, where we drove a double-digit increase in total distribution points and enhanced display activity contributing to 35% retail sales growth in the quarter and consumer engagement, including a successful marketing tie-in with the summer blockbuster Jurassic World Rebirth, which we amplified through media and in-store activations.\nOther core brands are also benefiting from the same playbook. For example, marketplace growth in mods our powerhouse, mom and kid focused brand accelerated in the back half of 2024 behind product and packaging innovation and a new brand campaign. Mott’'s has sustained this momentum into 2025 with more exciting news on tap for the fall, including the introduction of Mott’'s fruit smoothie pouches in time for the back-to-school season.\nBeyond the core recent portfolio evolution is beginning to more substantially move the needle at the segment level. This is most evident in energy where we believe our multi-brand approach will be the key to winning in this attractive high-growth category. Our 4 complementary brands GHOST, C4, Bloom and Black Rifle now combine to represent over $1 billion in annual run rate net sales for KDP and are scaling rapidly.\nEach of these energy brands contributed to our Q2 results. The GHOST acquisition was a meaningful top line driver and brand momentum continues to build under our ownership. GHOST point-of-sale trends markedly accelerated since we took over distribution in late Q1 as evidenced by our market share gains in Q2. C4's core performance platform also continues to outpace the category, propelled by innovative new flavors like classic lemonade and healthy base velocities.\nMeanwhile, Bloom is scaling at an impressive rate, it has garnered nearly a full point of market share just a year after introduction and has quickly established its credentials in the female forward energy space. Together, our brands are well positioned to achieve our goal of a double-digit share position within the fast-growing $26 billion energy category. With 7% market share already, KDP's energy portfolio is making quick progress against this target.\nAnd for comparison, just a few years ago, our share was below 1%. A combination of strategic portfolio construction and excellent KDP execution has powered these gains including nearly 1 point of market share growth in 2025 year-to-date and 30% plus retail sales growth in Q2. Given the robust runway for further growth, we are allocating meaningful resources to support our category ambitions led by a dedicated internal organization focused solely on energy.\nSimply put, we are confident we have the right brands, commercial playbook and go-to-market prowess to continue to win in this important space. The Q2 results demonstrate how KDP is successfully building out a broad-based refreshment beverages portfolio beyond our core CSD stronghold. As we capitalize on the expansion opportunity for our emerging brands, in categories like energy and sports hydration, we expect these areas to become increasingly important growth drivers for our U.S. refreshment beverage business and for KDP as a whole.\nMoving to U.S. coffee. The second quarter demonstrated sequential progress for the category and KDP. Starting with the category, both at home and single-serve sales growth accelerated from the first quarter as incremental pricing to offset inflation flowed through and volume remained resilient. The manageable category elasticity to date is encouraging, particularly as additional industry pricing actions have been announced, including our increase that will take effect during Q3.\nKDP's U.S. coffee business also exhibited sequentially improving trends in Q2. We made encouraging progress in pods with a better relationship between pricing and volume mix in brewers, though shipments remained pressured, point-of-sale consumption was stable. Looking to the back half, the U.S. coffee segment will need to manage through impacts from higher commodity inflation, increased tariffs and consumer uncertainty in the face of additional pricing. As a result, we expect segment performance to remain subdued for the balance of the year.\nEven as we navigate some quarter-to-quarter volatility, we continue to advance multiple initiatives designed to return our coffee business to consistent long-term growth. To provide a few examples, we continue to expand our premium and cold offerings into consumer preferred subsegments. In the premium set in Q2, we began rolling out Lavazza, flavored K-Cup varieties inspired by classic Italian desserts like tiramisu. Already a best-selling premium brand, Lavazza's entry into flavored coffee extends the brand into an attractive category subsegment that over-indexes to frequent consumers.\nWe're also seeing strong results in ready-to-drink coffee, one of our key cold initiatives. This superior Lackalone brand continues to generate triple-digit retail sales growth as it attracts new and younger consumers to the category. In brewers, we are innovating at both opening and premium price points. During Q2, we launched K-Mini Mate, our smallest brewer ever, featuring a new consumer-preferred visual identity with a more modern and colorful aesthetic, all at an affordable entry-level price point. And next month, we will introduce K-Kreme, a premium brewer with the ability to produce crematoped coffees from traditional K-Cup pods. Both brewers address unmet consumer needs and will help attract incremental households and occasions to the Keurig ecosystem.\nFinally, we are making great progress advancing our next-generation vision with the Keurig Ulta brewer and Karoun plastic-free aluminum-free pods. Ongoing in-home consumer beta testing is providing valuable user feedback while validating that the new system delivers a premium best-in-class at-home coffee experience. We're applying the learnings from our beta test to our commercial plans in support of a targeted launch in late 2026. These initiatives across pods, brewers and next-generation systems are all indicative of our sharp strategic focus in the U.S. coffee segment.\nCombined with encouraging category trends, we are confident they will help return our structurally attractive business to sustainable growth over time. In our International segment, Q2 performance remained quite solid, particularly considering tough year-ago comparisons and the softer backdrop in Mexico. Net sales increased 6%, led by pricing and operating income return to growth. We continued to drive strong relative performance across our business with market share gains in key categories, such as mineral water in Mexico and K-Cup pods in Canada.\nOur CSD portfolio also remained healthy across markets, benefiting from new campaigns and 0 franchise gains for brands like Dr Pepper and Crush as well as high-quality execution. As we look to the back half, we expect to maintain our relative momentum in international, thanks to strong base plans, our entry into the Canadian ready-to-drink tea category with Neste and additional pricing to help offset inflation and tariffs.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our enterprise performance during the second quarter. We're building a track record of delivery by executing with excellence and agility while remaining focused on the strategic framework that will position KDP for sustainable multiyear growth.\nI'll now turn the call to Sudhanshu and I'll return at the end with some closing thoughts.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter results, capping off a very healthy first half in a fluid operating environment. Robust commercial plans, coupled with sharp execution are driving our business momentum and we continue to target an unchanged full year outlook. Second quarter net sales increased 7.2% in constant currency. Our top line momentum was broad-based with double-digit gains in U.S. refreshment beverages, solid mid-single-digit growth in international and encouraging sequential improvement in U.S. coffee.\nNet sales growth was supported by multiple drivers. Net price increased 2.2% with positive contributions across all 3 segments. Pricing reflected the continued impact of actions taken to combat rising inflation, particularly in U.S. coffee and international. Volume mix grew 5% in the quarter. We experienced growth across our core liquid refreshment beverages portfolio and the GHOST acquisition also added 4 percentage points to the top line.\nGross margin contracted 110 basis points versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures that more than offset pricing and productivity savings. Strong SG&A leverage served as a counterbalance to the gross margin compression reflecting disciplined expense management across the organization. All in, our top line gains translated into 7% operating income growth as operating margins held steady with the prior year. EPS grew double digits in the second quarter, bringing first half growth to nearly 10% consistent with our expectation of a front half weighted year.\nMoving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages delivered another good quarter with net sales growing 10.5%. Volume mix was the primary driver, increasing 9.5% including a 6.6 percentage point contribution from GHOST. Net price realization also added 1% to the top line. Our base business trends remained solid with positive momentum in Dr Pepper and 7UP in CSDs, electrolyte in sports hydration and across our energy portfolio.\nWe are gaining market share within overall liquid refreshment beverages and have compelling back half commercial plans to sustain our strong relative performance. Segment operating income increased a healthy 8%, fueled by top line growth and productivity savings, which were partially offset by cost pressures. In the U.S. coffee segment, net sales declined modestly down 0.2% in the second quarter.\nOur top line demonstrated notable sequential improvement from the first quarter underpinned by the encouraging category trends that Tim discussed earlier. Net price realization has strengthened to 3.6%. This primarily reflected a building contribution from the early 2025 price increase across our owned and licensed portfolio, which was taken in response to escalating green coffee costs. We expect a further step-up in net price realization in the back half as additional already announced [indiscernible] and brewer pricing actions flow through in the market.\nSegment volume mix declined 3.8%. Trends in parts improved sequentially, reflecting manageable category elasticity and effective commercial programming. On the other hand, tighter inventory management by retailers weighed on brewer results, pressuring shipments despite stable consumer sell-through. Segment operating income grew 2%, building net pricing benefits and continued strong productivity helped to offset commodity inflation, though operating income also benefited from some cost phasing.\nWith tariffs and higher cost coffee hedges due to play a larger role in the coming quarters and given uncertain future category elasticity, we continue to expect some segment operating income pressure in the remainder of 2025. In International, net sales grew 5.7%. This was driven by net price realization, up 5.3% and a volume mix increase of 0.4% with the latter against a very difficult year ago comparison. The macro backdrop was challenging in the quarter, particularly in Mexico, where unfavorable weather was also a factor. Despite this, our international portfolio as a whole, maintained good relative market momentum supported by innovation and activation, strong in-market execution and ongoing investments in route to market.\nSegment operating income increased 2.6%, reflecting an improving balance between pricing, productivity and higher costs. On a go-forward basis, while we aren't immune to marketplace realities, we have well constructed plans for the back half and expect to deliver healthy international top and bottom line growth.\nMoving to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $325 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, which sequentially strengthened from the first quarter. We expect cash flow to accelerate further in the second half and we remain on track for healthy cash generation for the full year. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Organic and inorganic investments to further our growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and we are opportunistic share buybacks.\nImproving cash flow generation enables us to dynamically action against these priorities based on the most compelling opportunities we see. Our current balance sheet also provides ample near-term flexibility with today's leverage at a comfortable 3.3x, though we remain committed to our long-term goal of 2.5x or lower over time.\nShifting now to our 2025 guidance. Our constant currency outlook is unchanged. We continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales growth with a bias towards the high end of the range and high single-digit earnings per share growth. Based on current rates, we now anticipate that FX will represent approximately 0.5 percentage point headwind to the top and bottom line for the full year which equates to about a $0.01 impact to EPS.\nBelow the line, our guidance now reflects the following assumptions: interest expense of approximately $700 million and effective tax rate of approximately 23% and approximately 1.36 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Taking a step back, the operating backdrop continues to actively evolve and certain external factors, most notably trade policy remain uncertain and outside of our control. We are actively evaluating proposed future tariffs, potential mitigation steps and implementation time lines for those strategies all oriented around delivering solid full year performance.\nSpecific to the balance of year, our guidance assumes our top line momentum sustains, but cost pressures mount. As a result, we continue to expect some margin pressure in the back half which should contribute to a moderating EPS growth rate relative to the first half.\nIn closing, we are pleased with how our teams translated robust plan into a strong execution and results in the first half of the year. Our focus remains on delivering the full year while building a foundation for attractive long-term performance.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Tim for closing remarks.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThank you, Sudhanshu. With our strong first half results in the books, we remain on track to deliver our 2025 outlook even in a highly dynamic operating landscape. At the same time, we continue to advance our long-term value creation strategy with steady progress year-to-date across each of our strategic pillars. .\nIn an environment that places a premium on operational excellence, we're proud of our team's ability to balance near-term executional rigor with long-term-oriented thinking. We strongly believe that operating with this sort of discipline should support consistent and compelling results for KDP over time.\nWith that, we're now happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's earnings call for the first quarter of 2025. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Senior Vice President of Finance, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives\n\nThank you and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued 2 separate press releases detailing first quarter results and announcing the appointment of new independent directors to our Board of Directors. We will discuss these topics during this conference call and in the accompanying slide presentation that can be tracked in real time on the live webcast.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements which reflect KDP's judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC later today. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q1 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings material.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr Pepper's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.\nI'll now turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were strong. Net sales advanced more than 6%, and EPS increased more than 10%. We believe KDP is well positioned in today's fluid macro environment. The operating and regulatory backdrop demands a combination of organizational ballast and agility as a scaled beverage player that is also the industry challenger, KDP is fortunate to have both. Q1 served as a good demonstration. Our resilience was evident in the strong top and bottom line results. While each of our segments faced different conditions in Q1, we executed well to deliver strong and steady enterprise-level performance.\nDuring the quarter, we also moved quickly to assess and react to trade policy changes. Looking out to the balance of the year, our outlook best estimate, tariff-related pressures and mitigations based on the policies in place today. As a result, we continue to expect that 2025 will be another solid year of growth, and we are reaffirming our full year guidance.\nLet's now unpack the quarter's highlights and segment performance. Beyond the strong financial outcomes in Q1, there were several noteworthy achievements in the quarter also worth highlighting. These include market share gains across iconic liquid refreshment beverage brands like Dr Pepper and Canada Dry as well as newer brands like Electrolit and C4 accelerating price realization across each of our segments, reflecting actions to effectively manage inflation in 2025. A smooth start to the integration of GHOST Energy. We are hitting the ground running in establishing a true energy platform, with a 6.5% market share position already and momentum building, strong operating discipline, particularly in overhead cost management, and smart capital allocation, including the monetization of our very successful multiyear Vita Coco investment. Vita Coco has been a valued partner for the past 15 years, and we recently extended our distribution partnership to capture the significant growth opportunity ahead.\nAt the segment level, U.S. refreshment beverages continued to outperform on the back of very strong CSD trends. U.S. coffee experienced a softer start as the category began to work through commodity-driven inflationary challenges. And international proved resilient against a dynamic macro backdrop.\nI'll now dive deeper into each of our segments. Let's start with U.S. refreshment beverages, which was the clear standout in the first quarter. Net sales grew 11%, driven by strength in our core CSD portfolio as well as the initial contribution of our GHOST acquisition. Our CSDs outperformed in a healthy category. As consumer-obsessed brand builders, we delivered this result through a combination of impactful innovation, strong commercial execution and full funnel marketing. Dr Pepper had another great quarter with sizable market share gains including a meaningful contribution from our highly incremental Dr Pepper Blackberry launch in February. The new product, which pairs the iconic Dr Pepper flavor, with the rich sweetness of Blackberry has captured nearly a point of CSD share and is performing on par with our most successful innovations from recent years. The Dr Pepper franchise continues to gain distribution breadth and depth, thanks to innovation and 0 format expansion, which remains a multiyear growth opportunity for this powerhouse brand.\nWe also delivered healthy net sales growth in Canada Dry and 7 up due to attractive returns on recently stepped up innovation, marketing support and product refreshment, including our early 2025 launch of 7UP Tropical. More exciting activity for these and other CSD brands like A&W is forthcoming.\nOur energy portfolio was another area of strength in the quarter, entering year 3 of our partnership, C4 maintained its momentum, driven by DSD execution to expand the brand's distribution points and grow display penetration. Our integration of GHOST kicked off well, as did the distribution transition in late Q1. As we assume full influence over the brand, all the way to the shelf, we are beginning to execute against Ghosts significant growth opportunities. We are doing the same with emerging brands like female Forward Bloom sparkling Energy, which quickly scaled to 0.5 a share point in the category during Q1. And the recently launched mainstream-focused Black Rifle Energy line. Now that our thoughtfully constructed energy portfolio is in place, we are confident in our right to win and our team is eager to seize the opportunity.\nIn sports hydration, another exciting emerging category for KDP our work with Electrolit is entering year 2 on a strong growth trajectory. In Q1, the brand enjoyed significant and accelerating share gains, which should sustain as we pursue distribution white space and new packaging and product forms. Alongside our partner, Grupo PiSA we are committed to building electrolyte into a national and mainstream player, which will be supported by a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility currently under construction in Texas.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our U.S. refreshment beverages performance. Our portfolio has momentum. We are executing at a high level. and we have strong commercial plans for the rest of 2025.\nIn U.S. coffee, Q1 was a challenging quarter, with a 3.7% net sales decline and profit pressure. Though the single-serve categories transition in 2025 from volume led to pricing-led growth requires some patients to navigate. Our dual priorities are steadfast. First, mitigating record green coffee inflation, and second, fortifying our long-term growth model by addressing evolving consumer needs. During the first quarter, we took actions in support of both of these priorities.\nI'll begin with mitigating green coffee inflation. Given the magnitude of the pressure that we and the industry are facing we implemented a price increase across our owned and licensed brands to start the year. These pricing actions appeared on shelf earlier than many peers resulting in short-term volume and mix trade-offs in Q1.\nAs already announced industry pricing layers in over the coming months, we expect to see more typical price gaps among key single-serve brands and for the net impact of our actions to become more favorable looking out into the back half. We will continue to evaluate all available levers to offset inflation over the course of the year. These include potential additional pricing, more productivity savings and a sharper focus on the highest returning products, channels and households.\nThis brings me to our second priority, fortifying our long-term growth model. We are going after premium cold and next-generation opportunities to drive Keurig's future growth with Q1 progress across each dimension. We've been building a tier of premium and super premium coffees anchored by brands like Lavazza, La Calombe, Philz and others. These additions resonate with higher-value consumers and drive positive mix, and we've proven we can strongly accelerate these brands growth when part of our portfolio. As an example, Lavazza, K-Cup pods saw over 30% growth in Q1 retail sales, demonstrating significantly enhanced momentum just a couple of quarters after we assumed the brand license last year.\nAnother major focus area is capturing more cold occasions through a variety of total coffee formats. In Q1, we introduced new flavors to expand on 2024 successful Refreshers platform. These products are proving highly incremental at key retailers. Our La Calombe ready-to-drink coffees also continued to scale nicely in the quarter, supporting the brand's transformation into a formidable challenger in this multibillion-dollar beverage space.\nOur future coffee vision is also steadily progressing with behind-the-scenes work on the Keurig Alta system and plastic-free aluminum-free K-Rounds pods.\nOver the last few months, we advanced in-home consumer testing of the new system, generating valuable insights that we will apply as we expand the trial to even more households as well as plan for future commercialization. These examples illustrate how we are balancing our U.S. coffee activities this year between inflation mitigation and long-term growth initiatives. Though segment performance is likely to remain subdued in 2025. We are laying the groundwork for stronger and more multifaceted growth in the years ahead.\nMoving to International. Q1 sales grew in the mid-single digits. We're pleased with KDP's relative trends across our primary countries and will continue to lean in to bolster our momentum as the year progresses. In Q1, we saw strong growth in liquid refreshment beverages, driven by Peñafiel and our CSD portfolio, in particular, Dr Pepper and Crush.\nInflation-related pricing also started to flow through late in the quarter and supported top line gains across the international portfolio. We expect segment growth to accelerate over the balance of 2025, reflecting increased price realization and the activation of exciting commercial plans, highlighting our key international brands, many of which enjoy strong local identities.\nTo wrap up, our Dawn to Dusk beverage portfolio is delivering strong enterprise results while continuing to evolve towards faster-growing spaces. Simultaneously, we are capably managing through changing economic conditions and mitigating associated risks. As we move through the year, we will remain flexible and proactive as we work towards delivering on our 2025 financial commitments and advance our long-term strategic priorities.\nI'll now turn the call to Sudhanshu and will return at the end with some closing thoughts.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to 2025. Our business has momentum. We are executing well, and we are operating with discipline and agility. Together, these factors give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver solid results over the balance of the year. First quarter net sales grew 6.4% in constant currency. Our top line was driven by strong double-digit gains in U.S. refreshing beverages and healthy trends in international which more than offset a challenging quarter for U.S. coffee.\nOn a consolidated basis, the group was supported by multiple net sales drivers. Net price realization increased 2.8%, sequentially strengthening across each of our segments. This primarily reflected actions taken in response to inflation as well as some targeted trade spend refinements. Volume mix advanced 3.6% in the quarter which included solid base business growth, particularly in liquid refreshment beverages. The addition of cost to the KDP portfolio also contributed 2.9 percentage points to the top line.\nGross margin contracted 170 basis points versus the prior year. We expected this pressure given a difficult comparison and escalating inflation. Pricing and productivity should build in the coming quarters and our labs become easier, which will help us better manage expected headwinds.\nSG&A leveraged 90 basis points. Disciplined expense management is an ongoing focus, but is taking on even greater importance in today's less certain economic enrollment. We are constructively cushioning our processes streamlining where it makes sense and arriving at more efficient ways of working. These efforts will continue to bear fruit over the coming quarters driving operating leverage as we grow.\nIn total, operating income increased 3.9%. This translated to 10.5% EPS growth which was enhanced by below-the-line leverage, including a realized gain on the sale of our minority stake in Vita Coco. This transaction is testament to the merits of our flexible capital allocation approach, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.\nMoving to the segments. U.S. refreshment beverages posted another set of impressive quarterly results. Net sales growth accelerated to 11%. Volume mix was the primary driver, increasing 8%, including a 4.8 percentage point contribution from GHOST. Base business momentum was also strong, driven by CSDs and key partnerships. Net price realization contributed 3 points to segment net sales, primarily reflecting CSD pricing. Segment operating income grew 8.7% and as net sales momentum and productivity savings more than offset inflation. This growth also came despite a sizable net headwind on from lapping a larger C4 performance incentive in the year ago period. In the U.S. coffee segment, net sales declined 3.7% in the first quarter. As expected, net price realization inflected positively, contributing 1.5 points of growth as pricing actions on our owned and licensed brands began to flow through. However, this was more than offset by a 5.2% decline in volume mix. Part of the pressure reflected industry pricing layering in at different rates across the single subcategory which contributed to short-term volume and mix impacts. We also saw some retailers more closely managing trade levels as price increased. Segment operating income declined 12.5%. In the first quarter, net price realization and productivity proved insufficient to fully cover green coffee inflation and lower volume mix. We expect both revenue and operating income pressure to ease in the back half as the balance between pricing, productivity and inflation improves and as mix effects normalize.\nIn international, net sales grew 5.4%, with growth across regions and categories. Growth was led by favorable net price realization of 4.1%. The Volume mix was also up 1.3% driven by particular strength in liquid refreshment beverages in both Canada and Mexico. Segment operating income declined 4.6%. Similar to last quarter, this reflected the phasing of DSD investments in Mexico as well as an imbalance between pricing, productivity and inflation. Both factors were primarily a function of timing for the full year, our International segment should remain a strong top and bottom line growth contributor.\nMoving to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $102 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. Notably, this result included the known impact from a onetime $225 million got distribution transition payment. So on an underlying basis, our performance was even stronger. Our business model remains highly cash generative, and we continue to expect a healthy free cash flow year in 2025. Our dynamic capital allocation strategy was on display during the first quarter as we monetized our multiyear equity stake in Vita Coco. This was a clear demonstration of the mutual value that our partnership model creates. Since we began working with Vita Coco, we have helped to establish the brand as the clear leader in the vibrant coconut water category. The partnership has also generated attractive financial returns for KDP including the realized gain in the first quarter from the sale of our minority investment in the company. Shifting now to our 2025 guidance. Our constant currency outlook is unchanged. We expect mid-single-digit net sales growth with a bias towards the high end of the range and high single-digit earnings per share growth. Based on current rates, we now anticipate that FX will represent approximately a 1 percentage point top and bottom line headwind for the full year. Our below-the-line assumptions remain the same as our prior guidance. Specifically, we expect interest expense in a $680 million to $700 million range, and effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately $1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Based on what we know today, anticipated tariff impacts in 2025, appear manageable relative to our guidance. While we are not immune to the effects of these tariffs, multiple counterbalances should keep us on track to deliver the year. These include a series of mitigation steps that we are pursuing, flexibility from first quarter overdelivery and other in-year opportunities.\nHaving said that, we recognize that some external elements like future trade policy and potential consumer response are outside of our control. As a result, we will need to remain agile as we seek to deliver responsible and sustainable outcomes for KDP and for our consumers. In closing, we are pleased with the business momentum and a strong execution that powered our first quarter results. With our singular focus on beverages, scaled North American operations, and challenge our mindset. KDP is well suited to navigate today's very dynamic economic landscape while delivering consistently.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Tim for closing remarks.\n\nDara Warren Mohsenian\n\nMD, Morgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nThank you, Sudhanshu. This morning, we also highlighted the continued evolution of KDP's Board of Directors to help steward our next stage of growth. First, following a rigorous and extensive recruitment process, we appointed 2 new independent directors, Mike Vandeven, and Lawson Whiting. These highly qualified seasoned executives will bring valuable and complementary perspectives to our board. Second, Bob Gamgort's role is transitioning from Executive Chairman to nonexecutive Chairman of the Board, another natural next step in our governance. Having joined KDP more than 18 months ago, and assuming the CEO role a year ago, I can say with confidence that KDP has entered an exciting new chapter in our time as a public company. Our Board is refreshed and energized as is our executive leadership team. Together, we look forward to executing on the compelling growth and value creation agenda ahead.\nWith that, we're now happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024. This conference call is being recorded [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Senior Vice President, Finance, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our fourth quarter and full year results, which we will discuss during this conference call and in the accompanying slide presentation that can be tracked in real time on the live webcast.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements which reflect KDP's judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today.\nFor more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K which will be filed with the SEC later today.\nConsistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q4 and full year performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations towards the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings material.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr Pepper's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.\nI'll now turn it over to Tim.\n\nBryan Douglass Spillane\n\nMD of Equity Research, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a pivotal year for KDP. In a demanding operating environment, we delivered attractive performance consistent with our long-term algorithm and full year guidance. We unveiled our refresh strategy which we activated as the year progressed to set the stage for KDP's next phase of growth. And we took bold action to extend our portfolio into attractive white spaces and strengthen our commercial capabilities.\nIn short, we struck a thoughtful balance between achieving our annual commitments and setting up KDP for consistent, sustainable success. 2025 is shaping up as another dynamic year for the CPG industry, and we will remain agile in our execution while targeting a similarly balanced set of outcomes, delivering on algorithm financial results and simultaneously advancing strategic priorities to fortify our long-term growth model.\nLet me start with a quick review of our key 2024 accomplishments, which spanned each of our 5 strategic pillars. Beginning with consumer-obsessed brand building, a successful innovation slate and engaging marketing campaigns drove attractive growth across many of our iconic brands.\nTo provide just a few examples. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was our largest limited time offering ever and generated significant buzz. We capitalized on the dirty soda cultural phenomenon powered by social media, which helped drive our eighth consecutive year of market share growth for Dr Pepper.\nCanada Dry's first brand extension in year, Fruitsplash Cherry was the #1 innovation in the CSD category. The Mott's fall marketing campaign highlighting its fresh, minimally processed apples fueled full year share gains in juice and strong back half momentum in sauces. And in Coffee, our owned and licensed brands accounted for over 50% of the pod category innovation, spearheaded by our distinctive The Original Donut Shop Refreshers line, which was the #1 new product in the category and doubled our initial plan.\nWe shaped our now and next portfolio, seamlessly transitioning Electrolit and La Colombe to our DSD network and onboarding several new cola partners include leading brands such as Black Rifle in the U.S. and Canadian icon Kicking Horse.\nGHOST is yet another example of our portfolio strategy in action. Through this acquisition, which closed at year end, we added a successful emerging brand in the high-growth energy category that will benefit from inclusion in our advantaged distribution system. In total, our actions accelerated KDP's portfolio evolution to structurally faster-growing segments within the beverage industry.\nWe amplified our route-to-market advantage and further extended the reach and power of the KDP DSD system across multiple geographies and sites. Most notable in 2024 was the territory acquisition to extend our manufacturing and distribution presence into Arizona. The transaction provided direct exposure to a growing market and added high quality scale to our supply chain and logistics networks.\nWe also executed well across our existing footprint, translating to healthy marketplace trends for our base business and strong performance for our partner brands.\nOur Fuel for Growth focus permeated the organization, driving productivity savings at the high end of our target and generating SG&A overhead leverage, particularly in the second half of the year.\nAnd finally, we strengthened our free cash flow generation, which funded dynamic capital allocation activities. These included $1.1 million of share buybacks, our fourth consecutive annual dividend increase; and over $1 billion of strategic investments that will enhance our ability to deliver consistent, profitable growth in the future.\nOur strategy and the 5 pillars underpinning it represent our North Star. In 2025, we will set a high bar for operational excellence, while further advancing each of these pillars as we become an ever stronger and more advantaged beverage company.\nTo summarize our full year 2024 financial performance, we delivered results consistent with our long-term algorithm, with constant currency net sales growing approximately 4% and EPS growing 8%. Strong productivity and overhead savings drove P&L leverage and funded higher marketing investment.\nFree cash flow generation and conversion also improved considerably relative to prior year in keeping with our expectations. The strong performance during the year was led by our U.S. refreshment beverages and International segments, which each demonstrated standout momentum and together represent over 70% of revenue.\nIn U.S. coffee, we made progress and strengthened our business resiliency as the industry heads into an inflation-driven pricing cycle.\nMoving to Q4. At the enterprise level, we finished the year with momentum. During the quarter, KDP delivered a meaningful top line acceleration and solid bottom line growth. Constant currency net sales increased more than 6% led by U.S. refreshment beverages, which delivered an impressive double-digit sales gain. Notably, the net revenue trend across each of our 3 segments accelerated relative to the third quarter.\nVolume/mix was the primary top line driver, with year-over-year growth in each business. Price was also a positive contributor, with gains in U.S. refreshment beverages and International more than offsetting temporary price pressure in U.S. coffee.\nOur top line growth, productivity savings and overhead discipline mitigated escalating inflation, enabling increased investment behind our brands and solid EPS growth.\nFocusing on Q4 segment results. U.S. refreshment beverages net sales grew a very strong 10%, led by a volume/mix increase in the high single digits. Our teams executed exceptionally well to deliver this growth, which reflected base business momentum, traction from new partnerships and route-to-market additions.\nCarbonated soft drink momentum was particularly strong in Q4. The category remains healthy, and we benefited from compelling innovation and brand activity, as well as offerings that appeal to value-conscious consumers.\nOur CSD brands continued to win in the marketplace with market share gains in the quarter. Full Flavored Dr Pepper is now the #2 CSD in the category, and the Dr Pepper brand is the undisputed leader in the vibrant CSDs flavor segment. Dr Pepper was also the CSD category's largest share gainer during Q4, reflecting its consumer appeal, unique positioning and the benefits of our commercial activities.\nFor example, the seventh season of our Fansville college football marketing campaign was our most successful yet. We also saw continued traction from Dr Pepper's Zero Sugar portfolio, which will remain a strong growth vector going forward.\nCanada Dry was another top CSD performer supported by our Fruitsplash Cherry innovation. And 7UP grew market share as consumers responded to our Shirley Temple Holiday LTO and refreshed brand design.\nIn 2025, we expect robust CSD growth to continue supported by engaging full funnel [ eating ] activations and a promising CSD innovation lineup designed to extend our flavor leadership. This includes Dr Pepper Blackberry, which combines Dr Pepper's original 23 flavors with rich sweetness of blackberry. 7UP Tropical, which blends the crisp taste of 7UP with mango and peach fevers.\nAnd exciting seasonal activations across other iconic brands, including an indulgent and nostalgic A&W Ice Cream Sundae beverage and new flavors from our Crush and Sunkist brands. Notably, Dr Pepper Blackberry marks the first time we are simultaneously introducing an innovation across bottles and cans, fountain and frozen to maximize availability across various formats that our consumers enjoy.\nBeyond CSDs, the next largest driver of our Q4 growth was Electrolit, which is enjoying accelerating trends after converting to the EDP DSD system. Electrolit is one of the fastest-growing brands in the sports hydration category, and we see significant runway for future expansion.\nIn 2025, we will focus on strengthening Electrolit's distribution, including further transitioning the brand from Hispanic specialty to the mainstream sports hydration aisle. We will also leverage our DSD muscle to build electroless presence in Multipack and Zero Sugar offerings, where the brand meaningfully under indexes versus the category leaders.\nAlso during Q4, we made significant progress advancing our energy strategy. We drove strong growth to C4, gaining share within the attractive performance energy space and achieving an additional equity milestone in the process. We also began to transition Black Rifle Energy and Bloom to our DSD distribution network and closed on the GHOST acquisition.\nWith a formidable distinctive and complementary energy portfolio now in place, we are enhancing our operating structure and adding dedicated resources to ensure KDP's success in this important high-growth category. Just 3 years ago, our share in energy would have been close to 0. Today, it is over 6%. In 2025, we expect well over $1 billion in retail sales from our energy brands, and have set our sights on achieving a double-digit share position in the coming years.\nOverall, we are pleased with the performance of our U.S. refreshment beverages segment. Our exceptional Q4 results capped a strong 2024, and we have exciting plans in place to support sustained momentum in 2025.\nIn U.S. coffee, Q4 net sales decreased 2% with a modest volume/mix gain, including pod volume growth, more than offset by a temporary net price decline. We are encouraged by the improving state of the category and traction from our own portfolio efforts. Let me elaborate.\nFirst, year-over-year trends in the at-home coffee category improved on a value basis when compared to Q3, and the exit rate was healthy, with December representing the strongest month of the quarter. Second, in Q4, we continued to emphasize affordability, drive premiumization and advance at-home cold coffee offerings, all initiatives that we believe will have multiyear relevance in the category.\nConsumer acceptance of our price pack down counts remained strong. Our premium product tier continued to grow through our expanded commercial relationship with Lavazza, and we captured incremental consumers and occasions through cold offerings like K-Cup Refreshers,and our new K-Brew Shell Brewer.\nThird, we made progress expanding our participation in coffee formats and channels where we have historically been underrepresented. Our ready-to-drink coffee partnership with La Colombe performed very well, with retail sales growth meaningfully accelerating in Q4. Momentum in away-from-home coffee also improved in the quarter, and we see significant opportunity into 2025 as in-office work ramps and we further push into channels like hospitality and food service.\nThe combination of these factors put U.S. coffee on firmer footing exiting 2024, positioning it to be more resilient in 2025. We expect category conditions to be quite different this year given the inflationary pressure from coffee commodity costs. Accordingly, we are managing the business with 2 primary objectives.\nFirst, to preserve profit dollars and our ability to reinvest despite escalating green coffee costs. In response to this inflation, we announced pricing in Q4 that began to take effect in January, and saw many competitors take similar steps. However, the commodity price has continued to move even higher since then and we are evaluating all available options to offset the incremental pressure. These levers include driving greater productivity, optimizing mix and may also require further pricing actions with some elasticity offset.\nOur second objective is to continue to steward the single-serve category through marketing, innovation and activation in brewers and pods, while expanding our presence across total coffee occasions and solutions. We are planning to introduce compelling new products in various formats this year. And behind the scenes, we are advancing work on more disruptive launches like Keurig Ulta and K-Rounds stick and aluminum-free pods for the years to come.\nTurning now to International. We delivered another quarter of healthy top line growth with constant currency net sales increasing at a high single-digit rate. Momentum was broad-based across the portfolio. In International coffee, our top line was driven by market share gains for brewers and pods.\nIn cold beverages, our performance was led by Mexico LRBs, which grew nicely despite some signs of macroeconomic slowdown. These results were propelled by pay at the outline extensions, the expansion of power brands like Dr Pepper within Mexico and route-to-market investments across traditional and modern trade.\nDuring the quarter, we signed a Canadian licensing deal for Nestea, the leading iced tea brand in the country, furthering our international partnership strategy. The partnership will pick up later in 2025. And through this iconic brand addition to the portfolio, we expect to establish a leading position in an important LRB category while benefiting from enhanced scale across our total Canadian operations.\nAll in, our International segment continues to perform well. We are prioritizing this business for reinvestment, underpinning our confidence it can remain an outsized growth driver going forward.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our performance during 2024. We delivered strong results in a challenging environment while simultaneously positioning the business for the long term. This outcome was a direct output of the talent, dedication and hard work of our 29,000 colleagues across KDP. On behalf of my executive leadership team, I'd like to thank them for their efforts and impact.\nOur challenger mindset is well suited for the current environment, and we expect to continue to see strong results in 2025 from empowering our teams to play offense and take calculated risks.\nI'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu and will return with some closing thoughts about the year ahead.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the year with demonstrated excellent execution across the organization. We delivered 3.9% of sales growth, drove robust productivity to expand gross margin and leveraged SG&A through tight expense management. As a result, we grew operating income 9% and EPS 7.8%.\nWe also meaningfully strengthened our cash flow generation. And as Tim outlined, made notable strategic progress to lay the groundwork for our success in 2025 and beyond.\nOur fourth quarter closed the year on a strong note. Net sales grew 6.2% in constant currency, showcasing an acceleration relative to the first [indiscernible] and led by U.S. refreshment beverages and international. Enterprise volume/mix grew 5.3%, reflecting healthy base business trends and an ongoing contribution from new [indiscernible]. Net price realization was also a positive contributor, increasing 0.9%.\nGross margin contracted 120 basis points versus the prior year. We generated significant productivity savings in the quarter, and also benefited from positive price realization. However, this was more than offset by building inflationary pressures and the impact of lapping a tough year-ago comparison.\nSG&A leverage 20 basis points despite an increase in marketing investment, reflecting an enhanced overhead efficiency mindset across the organization. All in, operating income grew 3.4%, and including a tailwind from lower shares outstanding, EPS advanced 5.5%.\nMoving to the segments. U.S. refreshment beverages net sales grew an impressive 10.3%, accelerating from a mid-single-digit growth rate in the third quarter. Volume/mix was the primary driver increasing 7.5%, led by base business momentum, particularly in CSDs. We further benefited from an incremental contribution from Electrolit, where our partnership is progressing well and growth is accelerating.\nThe quarter also included the modest benefit of an extra shipping day due to calendar [ set ]. Pricing grew 2.8% in the quarter, primarily reflecting favorable price realization in our CSD portfolio. Segment operating income increased 8.6%, driven by the very strong net sales growth and robust productivity savings. We delivered this result while reinvesting even as we absorbed a net headwind from lapping a larger C4 performance incentive in the year ago period.\nIn U.S. coffee, net sales declined 2.4%. Volume/mix grew 0.7% in the quarter, driven by a 1.1% increase in port shipments. Our strategic initiatives showed traction with the underlying themes of affordability, growth and premium to remain in place on a multiyear basis.\nBrewer shipments declined 4% in the quarter, below point-of-sale consumption due to seasonality. On a full year basis, which is smooths out seasonality-related noise, brewer shipments increased 7.3%. Segment pricing declined 3.1% in the fourth quarter. We were affected some lingering pressure this quarter, but nonetheless encouraged by the improving trend. We anticipate category pricing will strengthen further in 2025 based on actions taken in response to green coffee inflation, including our January price increase.\nFourth quarter segment operating income declined 5.7% with productivity savings more than offset by the net price decline and green coffee inflation.\nMoving to International. Net sales grew 8.5% in constant currency. This strong result was led by volume/mix, which increased 6.5%, reflecting good momentum across regions. Net price realization was also a growth driver, contributing 2%. Inclusive of unfavorable effects, reported net sales increased 0.8%.\nSegment operating income declined 8.6%. This reflected 2 primary factors. First, a strong reinvestment in the quarter, including DSD expansion activities in Mexico and higher marketing across the segment. Second, escalating green coffee costs in the fourth quarter, with related pricing actions in Canada due to take effect in the middle of the first quarter.\nImportantly, we see these as temporary dynamics and expect our International segment to remain a strong top and bottom line growth driver in 2025 as a whole.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated a strong free cash flow of almost $700 million during the fourth quarter. This brought full year free cash flow to $1.7 billion, a significant step-up versus prior year, and we expect further progress in 2025.\nCash generation is the hallmark of KDP, and we remain on track to restore our business to healthy structural conversion levels over the next couple of years.\nAs Tim discussed, during 204, we deployed the cash flow we generated in a variety of value-enhancing ways, including over $1 billion of strategic investments to acquire a 60% ownership in GHOST and expand our DSD footprint into Arizona, $1.1 billion worth of share buybacks and a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend, marking our fourth consecutive year with a dividend raise.\nWe ended 2024 with management leverage of 3.3x, which reflected the GHOST transaction. This was above our long-term target of less than 2.5x, and more of our focus since 2025 will be on deleveraging. However, we feel comfortable that our accelerating free cash flow profile can support a disciplined, multipronged capital allocation strategy that also includes investments and steady dividend growth.\nMoving now to our 2025 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we expect mid-single-digit net sales growth and high single-digit earnings per share growth in line with our long-term algorithm. Based on current rates, we anticipate that FX will represent an additional 1 to 2 percentage point headwind.\nOur outlook assumes good momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments and an incremental contribution from the GHOST acquisition. The plan also recognize that U.S. coffee is likely to remain more subdued in a dynamic commodity environment even with higher pricing. We expect strong productivity and overhead discipline to generate Fuel for Growth and to support healthy operating income gains in the coming year.\nBelow the line, we forecast interest expense in a $680 million to $700 million range, and effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately 1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nThere are a couple of factors worth considering when it comes to the quarterly phasing in 2025. For one, Q1 will reflect the impact of a later Easter and 1 fewer shipping day compared with prior year. Plus the balance between inflation, pricing and productivity generation is slated to improve over the course of the year.\nAs a result, we anticipate a stronger top line and bottom line momentum in Q2 through Q4, particularly as the contribution from GHOST builds following the transition to our distribution network.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our 2024 performance and a good finish in the fourth quarter. We drove healthy marketplace trends across our base business, secured additional scale in attractive white spaces, strengthened our advantaged route-to-market system and embedded a greater efficiency focus throughout the organization. And we did this all while delivering on our plans.\nWe are confident 2025 will be another year of progress for KDP. We expect to showcase our operating agility in a dynamic environment, our relative insulation for price volatility, most importantly, our building momentum in the industry.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Tim for closing remarks.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. We achieved a great deal in 2024 and we're committed to delivering another strong performance in 2025. As we look to the year ahead, we are cognizant of the demanding operating backdrop, and will act with agility to navigate uneven consumer sentiment, higher inflation and a shifting regulatory landscape.\nWe have momentum across much of the portfolio with an exciting slate of marketing, innovation and sales activation plans. We are moving with speed to unlock significant productivity savings and, where appropriate, implement pricing in response to inflation and to ensure continued investment in the business.\nAnd we are hitting the ground running with GHOST, which we will activate in a big way as we transition distribution over the coming months. These factors support our confidence in another on-algorithm year, during which we will continue to distinguish ourselves as an advantaged player in the exciting beverage industry for the long term.\nThank you for your time, and we're now happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded.

For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nConsistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q2 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings materials.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr Pepper's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.\nI'll now turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. It's been 8 months since I joined this great, young and dynamic company. I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the organization, the quality of our execution and the challenger mindset our people embody each and every day. Together, we delivered healthy second quarter performance while making important progress to advance our strategic agenda. With our first half now in the books, we're on track to deliver full year results consistent with our on-algorithm outlook.\nThe operating environment remains uneven with resilient demand from higher-income consumers and value-seeking behavior among low and middle income consumers. We are highly attuned to these dynamics. And despite them, we still expect a top line acceleration over the balance of the year, thanks to several elements largely within our control, including new partnership growth and traction from innovation. At the same time, our first half weighted EPS delivery helps to pave the way for on-plan performance as we also seed our multiyear growth agenda.\nIn Q2, constant currency net sales growth sequentially improved to 3.4% and reflected a reweighting of our top line drivers, with pricing moderating and volume/mix accelerating to positive territory. We entered 2024 anticipating net price realization for KDP and the industry would normalize from the unusually high levels over the past few years, and it has. It's encouraging to now see a more balanced top line growth profile begin to emerge. At the same time, we remain focused on generating leverage throughout our P&L to fund reinvestment and drive earnings growth.\nIn Q2, continuous productivity savings and cost discipline drove strong operating margin expansion, helping to translate our top line momentum to a solid bottom line result, with 7% EPS growth versus prior year.\nAs we execute against our evolved strategic framework, we registered a number of wins in Q2. Let me highlight a few that we'll continue to pay off throughout the year, along with focus areas for the long term. As you know, one of our key strategies is consumer-obsessed brand building. Our innovation ramped significantly in the second quarter. And as expected, these new products are seeing good marketplace traction. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, Dr Pepper Creme Coconut is now our most successful limited time offering. Canada Dry Fruit Splash is also proving highly incremental to the brand. Together, these innovations are driving improved share trends across the CSD portfolio.\nOutside of CSDs, we're pleased with the initial response to our Buy One Water restage, which is reengaging consumers in its early days. In U.S. Coffee, our new refreshers from the original donut shop are on track to be the largest curing platform launch of the last several years. These coffee shop-inspired cold beverages are bringing new occasions and younger consumers into single-serve K-Cup category, and are supporting market share gains for our owned and licensed portfolio.\nOutside the U.S., our Peñafiel AIDS and Twist products are extending the powerful Peñafiel brand into new white space segments and contributing to market share gains for our Mexico portfolio. In total, these innovations will continue to develop over the coming months with additional news and activation upcoming across the portfolio, including in powerhouse brands like Mott's and Green Mountain. We also made progress with new partnerships as we focus on shaping our now and next beverage portfolio. With Electrolit and La Colombe now part of that portfolio, our excitement about each brand's future and the win-win collaboration models behind them continues to build.\nAs anticipated, revenue contributions from these brands increased during the second quarter and should further scale over the balance of the year. The transition of Electrolit volume to our DSD network is ongoing, with the handover to be complete in the back half. As we take on this distribution, we're beginning to unlock the brand's untapped potential, with outsized market share gains in KDP-served regions and channels. This performance underscores our go-to-market capabilities and spotlights the growth opportunity of Electrolit with sports hydration category.\nSimilarly, we continue to cultivate our La Colombe partnership across both take-up pods and shelf-stable ready-to-drink coffee. Focusing on the latter, the La Colombe's reformulated draft lattes are truly differentiated in this category and show strong promise. As we speak, our DSD organization is focused on expanding this unique products availability and display to drive initial consumer trial, contributing to strengthening marketplace trends.\nIn May, we also announced a planned transaction with Kalil Bottling Co., another concrete step to amplify a route-to-market advantage, which is a key component of our strategic agenda. With 1 of only 3 nationwide direct store delivery systems for LRBs, we understand innately the competitive advantage of controlling last mile distribution in our industry. This particular transaction will grant us full control of our brands distribution in Arizona, a strategic and fast-growing state. And with it, the ability to optimize and extract even more leverage from our local DSD assets.\nWe are moving quickly towards completing the acquisition of Kalil's production, sales and distribution operations in Q3, and we are honored that the Kalil family has entrusted us to carry on the legacy of their multigenerational business.\nPerhaps less externally visible in any single quarter is the significant work we're doing to dial up our productivity and fuel for growth engine. With consumer health mix, pockets of inflation returning, like in the case of green coffee, and currency volatility increasing, we are reinforcing our attention on driving productivity, network optimization, structural cost discipline. These focus areas are essential to securing additional near-term flexibility and room for reinvestment, and they are enablers of consistent delivery over the long term. We have an active agenda to support each element in 2024 and are laying the groundwork for meaningful further actions that will benefit us well beyond this year.\nAlso woven throughout our strategic agenda is a commitment to corporate responsibility and being a force for positive change. I'm proud of how our people incorporate this focus into everyday activities and decision-making, while also pursuing a set of ambitious multiyear targets. We highlighted this important work once again in our 2023 Corporate Responsibility Report published just last month. I encourage you to give it a read to track our progress and to witness how we live up to our Drink Well. Do Good purpose.\nNow let's turn to our Q2 segment top line performance, Sudhanshu will then discuss segment performance in more detail, including the strong margin expansion we deliver across the board. Starting with U.S. refreshment beverages, revenue grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. Our performance was led by CSDs, which remained an outperformer in the liquid refreshment beverage space by offering compelling everyday value and variety. Within the CSD category and as expected, our relative market share trend improved as Q2 progressed and as our 2024 innovation slate and brand activations layered into the market, resonating with consumers.\nBrand Dr Pepper maintained its long-term track record of market share growth on the back of this year's dirty soda-inspired Creamy Coconut LTO and the marketing excellence behind our new It's a Pepper Thing campaign. Our ability to steadily grow Dr Pepper by staying on top of trends and continually tapping into the cultural [indiscernible] is a defining characteristic of the brand. It's on track for its eighth consecutive year of market share outperformance, and yet there is still substantial untapped opportunity to further expand its preferred status.\nBeyond CSDs, we also delivered another strong quarter of growth for C4 energy. Despite the energy category's recent moderation, it remains a highly attractive space with consistently faster volume growth than all major beverage categories, including on a year-to-date basis. With C4, we also have a uniquely positioned brand that is gaining share with meaningful growth runway still available for us to realize. In some parts of the still beverages portfolio, we continue to see a more pronounced macro impact, leading to softer category growth rates.\nAs a result, we're taking steps to ensure our brand's value propositions are clearly resonating. This includes targeted channel-specific promotions, price pack work, like smaller bottles and multipacks, and a focus on value-oriented channels like club and dollar. Simultaneously, we are investing to drive demand through innovation and brand activations, such as this year's rollout of reformulated by WonderWater and the Summer Olympics gymnastics tie-in for Core Hydration.\nMoving to U.S. coffee. We made further progress against key priorities during the quarter. While overall at-home coffee category trends remain subdued, our relative performance is strengthening, with pod shipments improving to flat year-over-year in Q2. This outcome reflected market share gains across our owned and licensed brands, including initial traction across our 3 focus areas; affordability, premiumization and cold coffee. Together, these initiatives reflect a barbell strategy intended to highlight value for those consumers who are feeling stretched, and provide premium options for those with more spending power.\nWhen it comes to affordability, during Q2, we began rolling out smaller pack sizes intended to optimize the cost per package of K-Cup pods. Because of its multiserve nature, coffee is one of the highest dollar ring food and beverage categories, and these price pack adjustments enable us to hit more attractive everyday and promoted price points across grocery and club channels. At the same time, we launched digital campaigns that emphasize the affordability of consuming coffee at home instead of at coffee shops, which we see as particularly resonant messaging in the current environment.\nOur Q2 affordability strategy also extended to brewers where we drove sizable Keurig share gains, led by entry-priced machines and supported by some targeted value investments. Shifting to premiumization, the combination of brewer innovation and an increasingly well-developed set of super premium pods is strengthening Keurig system credibility with coffee connoisseurs and tapping into more affluent consumers. This includes our work with Lavazza, now a licensed brand within our portfolio as of Q2. With greater commercial influence, we have already secured expanded distribution for the brand and are just getting started on the activation agenda.\nMoving to cold coffee. We are actively pursuing the significant number of iced occasions currently occurring away from home. Cold coffee represents less than 20% of at-home occasions, while at certain coffee shops, cold beverages account for upwards of 70%. One way we are pursuing this white space is through K-Cup innovation, with significant activity during Q2, including refreshers and cold brew pods. These items performed well in the quarter with wider distribution and support slated for the back half. We're excited to further address the cold opportunity through brewers, including the upcoming launch of our new K-Brew + Chill brewer in Q3, as well as through the continued expansion of La Colombe ready-to-drink coffee.\nAll in, we're encouraged by the progress we are seeing from our multiple coffee initiatives, which is visible in improving market share for both K-Cup pods and brewers. Even so, and as with many food and beverage categories today, demand trends across the larger at-home coffee category are soft. In single serve, a promotional environment that is at odds with significant green coffee inflation, also persists. This softer demand backdrop supports why we constructed our 2024 outlook, assuming a muted revenue growth contribution from U.S. coffee, which remains an appropriate planning stance.\nTurning now to international. Impressive segment performance continued in the second quarter, with double-digit constant currency growth on the top and bottom lines and broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In cold beverages, strong in-market execution in both Mexico and Canada powered our results. Compelling Peñafiel line extensions, momentum behind Clamato and Canada Dry, and Atypique share gains in the low and no-alcohol category led the growth.\nOur Canadian coffee results were also robust in the quarter, driven by our owned and licensed brands and supported by Nuance portfolio management. With exceptional strength in the international business in Q2, we also seized the opportunity to reinvest in our brands and capabilities to seed future growth, adding to our confidence in sustained segment momentum.\nIn closing, we're pleased with our overall second quarter performance and remain on track to our full year outlook. At the same time, we are activating our strategic agenda. Our consumer-centric approach to brand building is resonating in market. Successful portfolio expansion into higher growth categories, like energy, sports hydration and ready-to-drink coffee, continues. And multiple initiatives to strengthen an already potent route to market are underway, including our pending transaction with Kalil Bottling.\nWe also remain highly focused on furthering our enterprise-wide efficiency and agenda, which will underpin our visibility for the balance of the year and our ability to invest in the future. And throughout, our capital discipline is unwavering. And with a strong balance sheet and improving free cash flow, our ability to strategically deploy our cash is robust.\nWith that, I'll turn the call to Sudhanshu.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our solid Q2 financial performance speaks to KDP's strength of execution. Net sales growth sequentially accelerated, with margin expansion powering double-digit operating income growth and high single-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow conversion also strengthened. We are pleased with our progress year-to-date and have visibility to our full year outlook.\nOur constant currency net revenue grew 3.4% in the quarter. Performance was led by a strong double-digit growth in our International segment and healthy trends in U.S. refreshment beverages, balanced against continued muted performance in U.S. coffee.\nConsolidated volume mix grew 1.8% year-over-year, inflecting back to growth as new partnerships scaled and our innovation gained traction in the marketplace. We saw broad-based volume/mix progress across the business with positive growth in each segment. 1.6 points of pricing also added to consolidated net sales growth. This reflected a more normalized level of net price realization in U.S. refreshment beverages relative to recent quarters and ongoing gains in international. This was partially reduced by the impact of previously discussed price cap adjustments in U.S. coffee.\nGrowth margin expanded strongly, up 130 basis points versus prior year, driven by the favorable net impact of productivity, pricing and inflation. SG&A grew at a slower rate than net sales, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of leverage in the quarter. All in, total company operating income grew strongly, up 11% versus prior year. Even with some offset from below-the-line items, EPS growth was a healthy 7% in Q2.\nMoving to the segments. U.S. refreshment beverages net sales grew 3.3% in the quarter, led by 2.9 percentage points from net price realization. The pricing contribution reflected increases in CSDs taken in early 2024, partly offset by targeted value investments across other parts of the portfolio. As expected, segment volume/mix returned to growth in Q2, increasing 0.4%. This performance reflected a ramping benefit from the successful transition of Electrolit volume to our DSD network, as well as our Q2-weighted innovation calendar.\nOur new products are resonating in the marketplace as evidenced by improving share trends for brands like Dr. Pepper and Canada Dry. We expect the building benefit from partnerships and innovation over the balance of the year to yield accelerated volume/mix growth in the back half. Segment operating income grew 11.9% in the quarter and margins expanded 230 basis points primarily reflecting tailwinds from net pricing and productivity. We continue to expect healthy operating income growth in U.S. refreshment beverages for the full year, though not at the same magnitude as we saw during the first half.\nIn U.S. coffee, net sales declined 2.1%, with volume/mix growth of 0.8%, offset by a 2.9% net pricing decline. We have made sequential progress in driving improved K-Cup trends over the past few quarters, and we were pleased to see port shipments stabilized in Q2 with 0.2% growth. As Tim described, [ unrealized ] share gains were a major driver with traction across our strategic initiatives. Our market share momentum sustained into the back half. At the same time, we built our full year plan, assuming only muted at-home coffee category trends, which is what we have experienced year-to-date. We are expecting similar category dynamics for the balance of the year.\nBrewer shipments increased 2.1% in Q2 with the rolling product trend improving to 1.4% growth. Our innovation and commercial strategies are driving meaningful share gains, particularly from our value brewers, and we expect this share momentum to persist in second half. Segment net pricing decreased 2.9%. Similar to last quarter, this reflected investments to appropriately manage price gaps in a competitive single-serve environment. U.S. operating income grew modestly versus prior year, and margins expanded 70 basis points, with productivity savings and cost discipline effectively neutralizing the profit impact of price investments.\nAs expected, our year-over-year margin trend is moderating as we calibrate our growth drivers to achieve greater balance between our top and bottom line delivery. This may likely play out to an even greater degree in the back half as we lap more difficult company issues and combat inflation, so we still expect segment margin expansion on a full year basis.\nInternational net sales grew 15.5% on a reported basis and 14.7% in constant currency. Segment growth was comprised of very strong 10.4% volume/mix growth and a 4.3% increase in price. Our performance reflected growth across markets and categories, including Canada Coffee and Latin American LRBs, driven by excellent execution. Segment operating income advanced significantly, increasing 30.2% in constant currency terms. Growth was driven by net sales gain and net productivity, which more than offset a significant increase in marketing. We will continue to make high-quality investments as they execute our strategy to capture the outsized growth opportunity in our international business.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow. In Q2, we generated $543 million in free cash flow, reflecting a combination of typical seasonality, capital discipline and a more modest impact from our supplier financial program reductions. For the first half in total, free cash flow grew roughly 50% versus prior year and conversion improved. We expect back half free cash flow conversion to improve further relative to the first half. The accelerating free cash flow profile supports an unchanged capital allocation agenda.\nOur priorities remain organic and inorganic investments to further our growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and the opportunistic share buybacks. We dynamically manage these options in the short term with a balanced approach over the long term. For example, following our significant share repurchase activity in Q1, we had more modest discretionary cash outlays in the second quarter, resulting in a slight reduction in management leverage during the period. We remain committed to our long-term leverage target of 2x to 2.5x, though are comfortable following a nonlinear path.\nMoving now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans embed a net sales acceleration over the back half of the year, which is based largely on factors within our control, like partnerships and innovation. Even so, we are cognizant of mixed consumer environment and are focused on strong execution to secure full year delivery.\nEven as revenue growth accelerates, we do expect back half EPS growth to moderate sequentially, that is the strong first half EPS profile provides us with sufficient flexibility to manage through accelerating inflation, product headwinds and ongoing investments in the back half of the year, while delivering on full year expectations. From a phasing perspective, we expect roughly similar rates of EPS growth in quarter 3 and quarter 4.\nOur full year 2024 outlook embeds the following unchanged below-the-line assumptions: interest expense in a $625 million to $645 million range, an effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately 1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In closing, we are quite pleased our second quarter results and feel good about our ability to deliver the year, while also advancing key strategic initiatives with multiyear payback windows.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Tim to close.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. Now halfway through the year, 2024 is progressing well and according to plan. We knew that our top line momentum would build quarter-over-quarter, and it has. Improving market share trends and strength of execution should support further net revenue acceleration in the back half. We also knew that margin and EPS gains will be tilted towards the first half, and we delivered. With 9% EPS growth in the first 6 months of the year, we have good visibility to delivering on-algorithm performance in 2024, while solidifying our focus on the strategic initiatives that will fuel consistent growth over multiple years.\nBefore moving to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our greatest source of competitive advantage, our talented people. I'm thankful to our 28,000 colleagues for the hard work and dedication reflected in our Q2 results, and in the strategic agenda we are simultaneously activating that will benefit us in the future.\nThank you for your time, and we're now happy to take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce the company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Please go ahead.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives\n\nThank you. And hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our first quarter results, which we will discuss during this conference call. We have also added a slide presentation to our earnings material. The slides accompany our prepared remarks and can be tracked in real time on the live webcast. They will be archived on our IR website afterwards.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements, which reflect KDP's judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nConsistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q1 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings materials.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr. Peppers Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; incoming CEO and Chief Operating Officer, Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.\nI'll now turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane. And good morning, everyone. It has been a busy and exciting start to the year at KDP. First quarter performance was strong, with solid consolidated sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. Momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and International segments remained healthy, and U.S. coffee results showed meaningful sequential recovery. We invested in marketing and capabilities across the business while also delivering attractive broad-based margin expansion. The strong start to the year enhances our visibility to an unchanged on algorithm 2024 growth outlook.\nIn Q1, we also advanced several strategic initiatives that position the company for multiyear success and demonstrate our confidence in the value creation opportunity ahead. First, we unveiled a revolutionary future vision for the Keurig brewing system that has been years in the making. When launched, our new proprietary K-round plastic and aluminum free pods and Keurig Alta brewers will enable consumers to brew a wide variety of hot and cold Barista-style beverages from a single machine using a pod that can be easily and sustainably disposed. This system has the potential to redefine how consumers brew coffee for decades to come, and we're excited to begin beta testing later this year. At the same time, we are committed to growing our preeminent existing K-Cup system, including through a strong slate of innovation in 2024.\nSecond, in Q1, we also took advantage of a highly-compelling and dislocated stock valuation by executing a $1.1 billion buyback of 38 million KDP shares. This was our largest quarterly share purchase -- repurchase in our history, and we have progressively increased our buyback activity over the past several years. And with another $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, we intend to stay [indiscernible], which we failed at an Investor Day hosted last month. This strategic framework combines many of the philosophies and practices that KDP has developed for the last 5 years with new elements intended to drive strong and self-reinforcing growth in our next chapter as a public company [indiscernible] first quarter results.\nFinally, this morning, we announced that Tim has been appointed KDP CEO and will join our Board effective tomorrow, marking the culmination of a robust transition process that began when he joined us in November. I have worked closely with Tim over the past several months and have seen firsthand how our company is benefiting from his deep and diversified CPG experience, strategic [indiscernible]. I look forward to continuing to partner with Tim and the broader leadership team in my ongoing capacity as KDP's Executive Chairman and could not be more confident in their stewardship of the company's next chapter.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Let me start by once again expressing my appreciation to Bob and our Board of Directors for the honor and privilege of leading this dynamic company into the future. I'm energized to partner with our 28,000 colleagues across the globe to build on KDP's strong track record and to guide our next chapter of growth and value creation.\nI see a tremendous amount of upside ahead. At our recent Investor Day, I shared the many elements behind my conviction and discussed how we intend to unlock this future opportunity. If you've not yet had the chance, I would encourage you to watch the replay of that event.\nNow as Bob mentioned, we recently introduced an Evolve strategy, which is anchored by 5 strategic pillars. These are effectively a road map to guide each of our employees' actions every day, and it includes directives to champion consumer-obsessed brand building, shape our now and next beverage portfolio, amplify our route-to-market advantage, generate fuel for growth and dynamically allocate capital. This strategic framework will guide our company over the next few years and is designed to deliver a sustainable cycle of growth. Each element of this strategy featured in the first quarter, which represented a strong start to the year.\nNet sales growth accelerated sequentially with continued momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages and international [indiscernible] in U.S. coffee. Gross margin expanded significantly, driven primarily by robust net productivity, which funded reinvestment to support our future growth and drove strong earnings growth in the quarter. And we flexed our capital allocation priorities toward direct shareholder returns, taking advantage of a unique opportunity to efficiently repurchase a large number of shares at an attractive valuation. Overall, our first quarter performance demonstrates the health of our business and provides enhanced visibility to our unchanged full year outlook for mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth.\nTaking a closer look at the intersection of strategy and Q1 results, we were encouraged by the quarter-over-quarter acceleration in net sales growth to nearly 3%. Though top line momentum remained pricing-led, volume mix improved to nearly flat, following declines during 2023.\nConsumer-led innovation leveraging our comprehensive demand space framework was an important contributor to this improvement. Here are 2 quick examples. In U.S. refreshment beverages, we launched Canada Dry Fruit Splash, a flavor extension of our second largest CSD brand. The innovation is performing well during the early launch phase, proving incremental to the Canada Drive franchise and driving market share gains. In international, we introduced Schweppes mocktails as the first can mocktail product in Mexico, securing distribution with several large customers and generating very strong initial consumer acceptance. The launch is already exceeding our plan, and we have yet to turn on the advertising. Innovation activity ramps across our portfolio in Q2, and we're excited to build on our initial momentum as we move through 2024.\nOur top line growth during the first quarter also reflected the continued successful execution of our partner strategy. Electrolit sales and distribution commenced in the quarter, and lock alone ready-to-drink beverages are now ramping through the system with smooth distributor handovers and early traction, also continues to grow strongly, and we achieved further key performance milestones in Q1. DSD execution is a key enabler to this success and we continue to invest to drive greater efficiency throughout the system.\nImproving first quarter trends in U.S. coffee owned and licensed brands illustrate our commercial and route-to-market effectiveness. Our owned and licensed market share began a recovery, which steadily strengthened throughout the quarter. Distribution growth, increased display activity, price gap management and increased marketing all contributed, and this better trajectory has sustained quarter-to-date with more high-quality activation to come later this year.\nTotal KDP gross margin expanded 350 basis points in the first quarter, and gross profit dollars grew approximately 10%. This strong performance reflected an enterprise-wide focus on productivity, which yielded meaningful benefits during the quarter and more than offset persistent inflation as well as the benefit from an additional C4 performance incentive. Our gross profit progress provided important fuel for growth funding reinvestment, including a double-digit increase in marketing and also contributed to the very strong bottom line results in Q1. Specifically, operating income grew an impressive 17.5% year-over-year and earnings per share advanced 12% ahead of our ingoing expectations.\nWith top line momentum expected to build from here, I'll now spend a few minutes discussing each of our segment's Q1 net sales performance and why we have confidence in the balance of the year.\nLet's start with U.S. refreshment beverages. Revenue momentum remained healthy with mid-single-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Our performance was led by solid growth in CSDs and our expansion in energy and sports hydration, partially offset by softer trends in certain still beverage categories. As anticipated, segment growth moderated from Q4 as we lapped year-ago pricing measures and due to innovation timing, which phases later in '24 when compared to 2023. In Q1, we anniversaried the launch of Dr. Pepper Strawberries and Cream, which was a standout success and went on to become the #1 CSD category innovation of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect an exciting 2024 innovation and brand activation slate to drive a larger sales contribution in future periods.\nOur Dr. Pepper Creamy Coconut limited time offering is launching as we speak, just in time for the summer season, and it capitalizes on the popular dirty soda social media trend. The complete restage of by Wunderwater is just beginning to roll out, and our core hydration partnership with U.S. Gymnastics will be activated during the summer Olympics. We expect these collective activities will have a larger impact in the back half. In addition, our partnership with CR should continue to enjoy good momentum, and our sales and distribution of Electrolit will build over the course of the year.\nWhile the magnitude of overall U.S. refreshment beverage pricing should moderate going forward as we increasingly anniversary year ago activity, modest incremental pricing across CSDs was announced earlier this year and will contribute to growth. We also continue to optimize price pack architecture to fit consumer needs across the portfolio and various channels.\nMoving now to U.S. coffee. As expected, net sales strengthened considerably relative to the fourth quarter and decreased at a more modest low single-digit rate in Q1. Notably, volume mix was basically flat, improving from a high single-digit decline last year. There were a number of green shoots in the quarter for U.S. coffee. Let me outline 5 key elements that bolster our confidence in continued top line recovery in this segment.\nFirst, our pod shipment trends improved sequentially. Though at-home coffee category consumption growth remains muted, the trend modestly recovered relative to Q4. More importantly, Keurig's own volume momentum accelerated throughout the quarter.\nSecond, our owned and licensed brand market share momentum is building, which is a mix accretive trend. In Q1, we grew owned and licensed total distribution points at a double-digit rate. We increased activity and supported our brands with higher marketing. In addition, we made tactical adjustments to appropriately align our promotion strategy. This is already having an impact and will allow greater innovation, marketing and activation to shine through in the balance of the year. owned and licensed share momentum progressively strengthened throughout the quarter, and we expect the trend to continue supported in part by upcoming price pack architecture changes to strengthen the value proposition.\nThird, within the coffee maker category, Keurig and Keurig compatible brewers also continued to gain share in Q1, extending a multiyear track record of outperformance. And exciting innovation like K-Brew + Chill, which has not yet launched and will hit retailer shelves later this year should further support our performance.\nFourth, as our volume in U.S. coffee improves, so does our ability to manufacture at a more attractive cost profile. We generated strong productivity during the first quarter, which drove healthy segment margin expansion and funded reinvestment. We're also beginning to optimize our manufacturing footprint to favor high-efficiency locations like Spartanburg, where capacity is ramping and unlocking further network optionality, which should also generate fuel for growth.\nAnd finally, fifth, the Keurig partnership proposition remains very strong as evidenced by multiple recent brand additions to our ecosystem. Lavazza will transition from a partner to a licensed brand during the second quarter. Also in Q1, we reached agreements to welcome Brooklyn Roasting Company, Shark Tank favorite Kahawa 1893 coffee and Canadian super premium brand ticking horse to our roster. And just this morning, we are announcing the addition of Black Rifle Coffee as a new partner. Black Rifle Coffee's success in the coffee industry is already well established, and their decision to evolve to a Keurig system partner speaks to the full view proposition of our stewardship of the single-serve category. Our lock-alone, ready-to-drink coffee partnership is yet another proof point and is just now beginning to scale. In total, these exciting partnerships will begin to contribute to U.S. coffee segment volume growth later in 2024.\nMoving on to international, which is becoming an increasingly significant part of our business and is a core part of our strategic agenda. The segment's strong sales performance continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth on a constant currency basis and broad-based strength across categories and markets.\nOur cold beverages portfolio performed particularly well in Latin America, reflecting continued strong DSD execution. Performance was led by our Powerhouse Penafiel brand, which continues to enjoy strong base momentum even as we extend the brand into new adjacencies. For instance, we recently launched Penafiel soft seltzers, which offers sparkling mineral water with a refreshing touch of flavor, no calories, no sugar and with 100% natural flavors. We also further grew our segment presence in the low and no alcohol alternatives category, with continued share gains for Atypique in Canada and strong retail and consumer reception for our launch of Schweppes mocktails in Mexico. In our Canadian coffee business, market share grew for Keurig brewers and for our owned and licensed pod portfolio led by the Van Houtte brand.\nAs in the U.S., we continue to strengthen our international route to market. And earlier this month, we announced a multiyear partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays for poor rights at their ballpark. We're excited to expand Canada Dry, Dr Pepper, Clamato, Crush and Atypique.\nIn short, we're pleased with the promising start to the year. We demonstrated sequential top line progress in the quarter and delivered broad-based growth in adjusted operating income [indiscernible] will speak more about our margin progress and our intention to continue balancing growth and reinvestment in the coming quarters. We're confident this approach will reinforce our 2024 outlook for on algorithm, top and bottom line growth, which remains unchanged while also powering a virtuous cycle of growth over a multiyear time frame.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Sudhanshu.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results were strong, demonstrating sequentially improving net sales growth, continued meaningful gross margin expansion and incremental investments in marketing and capabilities [indiscernible] and as buffer against pockets of reemerging commodity inflation.\nFirst quarter net revenue grew 2.8% in constant currency. Healthy momentum continued in our U.S. refreshment beverages, and International segments [indiscernible]. Net pricing up 3.1% year-over-year. This was driven by favorable pricing in our U.S. refreshment beverages and international portfolios, balanced against previously flagged targeted price investments in U.S. coffee. Importantly, consolidated volume mix improved to nearly flat year-over-year, showing a modest 0.3% decline in the quarter. Gross margin expanded significantly up 350 basis points, driven by the favorable combined impact of productivity, pricing and normalizing inflection. Gross margins also reflected a performance incentive related to strong commercial execution of our C4 partnership. This benefit contributed slightly over 100 basis points to the gross margin in the quarter and now offers us extra flexibility to drive future investment. SG&A deleveraged 50 basis points in Q1 due in part to a double-digit increase in marketing. All in, total company operating income grew very strongly [indiscernible]. Net sales grew [4.3%].\nMoving to the segments. U.S. refreshment beverages net sales grew 4.3%, led by 5.6 percentage points of pricing. [indiscernible]. As expected, our relative market share and net sales performance reflected a later innovation cadence relative to 2023, particularly in CSDs. These calendar differences will normalize as new products get introduced and our innovation gains traction. In other words, segment net sales drivers should rebalance further towards volume mix as market share performance improves in quarter, and margins expanded 440 basis points. Tailwinds included pricing, strong productivity, and the C4 performance incentive I mentioned earlier. This combination of factors helps fund higher marketing in the quarter. All in, we have good line of sight to continued operating income gains in U.S. refreshment beverages over the balance of the year though not at the same magnitude as we experienced over the last couple of quarters.\nU.S. coffee top line trends significantly recovered relative to Q4 as expected, while net sales declined 2.1% volume [negatory] and decreased down a modest 0.3% [indiscernible] driven by a steady recovery is 1.1%, This progress was driven by a steady recovery in volume and market share momentum across our owned and licensed portfolio during the quarter. With multiple elements underpinning this trend, including greater distribution and display and a more appropriately aligned promotional strategy, we expect innovation and activation to begin having an even greater impact in the balance of the year.\nBrewer shipments increased 26% in Q1 due to a combination of improving trends in the coffee maker category, continued Keurig market share gains and timing benefits. On a rolling 12-month basis, which smooths out some of the inherent quarterly brewer volatility, shipments are still down just under 2%, representing an improving trend versus the double-digit decline we experienced in 2023. Segment net pricing decreased 1.8%, primarily due to previously discussed promotional adjustments across our owned and licensed portfolio. This is in response to competitive activity began in Q3 last year and continues today. These recalibrations more than offset the continued benefit of pricing we are realizing through partner contracts while improving segment mix.\nU.S. coffee operating income advanced 1.4% and margins expanded 110 basis points versus the prior year driven by productivity savings and easing cost pressures, partially offset by higher marketing spend. As expected, the rate of segment margin expansion moderated versus the back half of 2023 as we are managing towards a more balanced top and bottom line outcome in this [indiscernible] the progress we made during quarter 1.\nInternational segment net sales grew 11.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%, with very solid volume mix growth of 4.8% and pricing up 2.2% year-over-year. Our performance included growth across market and categories with particular strength in Latin American LRBs. Segment operating income advanced very strongly, up 25% in constant currency terms. Volume mix growth, pricing and productivity netted favorably against inflation and higher marketing. We also continued to invest in route-to-market capabilities including the on-premise expansion in Canada that Tim mentioned and by strengthening our DSD network in Mexico. Given its outside growth potential, investing in our international business is a significant priority and should support an increased top and bottom line contribution from the segment in 2024 and over time.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our Q1 free cash flow represented a use of $73 million. Cash generation is seasonally lower during the first quarter, and the year-over-year difference in free cash flow versus Q1 2023 was largely a function of a front-loaded cadence to our CapEx investment this year. In absolute terms, free cash flow also remained weighed down by roughly $400 million of reductions in supplier financing arrangements. We expect the impact of the carryover effects of these changes to moderate over the coming quarters and for free cash flow to accelerate with full year conversion projected considerably ahead of 2023 levels. This will support our capital allocation agenda [indiscernible] returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend, and we are opportunistic share buyback.\nWe will remain dynamic in managing across these priorities at any point in time with a balanced approach over the long term. For example, in Q1, we repurchased 38 million shares for a total of $1.1 billion, taking advantage of an attractive valuation and the liquidity event presented by JV secondary offering. Though our management leverage ratio increased modestly as a result, we remain committed to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5x.\nMoving now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans continue to embed strong top line momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and International segments with a relatively muted growth contribution from U.S. coffee. We expect productivity savings to help offset a more normal level of inflation. There are, however, pockets of reemerging commodity inflation, for instance, in the green coffee price. We will need to monitor and manage these, particularly in the back half.\nThroughout the balance of the year, we also plan to continue to deploy investment dollars behind brands and capabilities. The incremental flexibility afforded to us by our Q1 outperformance should enable us to balance these concentrations. As a result, we continue to anticipate healthy operating profit growth and full year operating margin expansion on a consolidated basis.\nConsistent with our original guide, we expect some of this operating momentum to be offset by a net headwind from below-the-line items, constraining operating profit flow-through to EPS. Our '24 outlook embeds the following below-the-line assumptions, which now reflect share repurchase and financing activity from Q1. Interest expense in [indiscernible] approximately 1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nIn closing, we are pleased with the stronger-than-anticipated start to the year which bolsters our confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance while filling a virtuous cycle for the long term.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back to Tim to close.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. Before we move to Q&A, I want to thank our KDP colleagues for embodying our company's challenger mindset every day. In Q1, we collectively put the business on an accelerating path in a dynamic macro environment. Strong execution was visible across our results and in every country end market in which we compete. [indiscernible] for KDP's Evolve strategy, which was particularly evident at this month's annual so of the company's top leaders. Together, we're excited to activate this strategy to unlock considerable future value for our shareholders.\nThanks for the time, and we're now happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n[Operator Instructions]\nThis conference call is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce the company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, you may begin.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. We appreciate your attention, recognizing that many of you are also attending an industry conference. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our fourth quarter and full year results, which we will discuss during this conference call.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements which reflect KDP's judgments, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K, which will be filed with the SEC later this morning. We will also discuss non-GAAP measures of our performance. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings release. We will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our body armor lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and the change in accounting policy for stock compensation.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; Chief Operating Officer; Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudanshu Priyadarshi. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a year of significant progress for KDP as we grew share across the majority of our business, entered multiple high-growth white spaces, such as ready-to-drink coffee and sport hydration through highly capital-efficient partnerships, began to rebuild margins while simultaneously driving high-quality reinvestment, returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders, including a 7.5% dividend increase in the opportunistic repurchase of 22 million shares and delivered our financial outlook, while significantly improving the composition of our earnings and strengthening our balance sheet. .\nFull year constant currency net sales grew nearly 5% and EPS advanced 6%. On an underlying basis, our EPS growth was even stronger and in the double digits as we largely eliminated the contribution from nonoperational gains that benefited the prior year. Pricing actions and a near doubling of year-over-year productivity savings, more than offset continued inflationary pressure, supporting earnings growth even as we funded a double-digit increase in marketing. Our 2023 performance demonstrated the resilience inherent in our broad portfolio with continued momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages and international offsetting short-term pressures in U.S. coffee.\nWe also initiated a thoughtful succession process that balances continuity and new perspectives across the company's most senior leaders. Tim and our refreshed executive team have merged seamlessly are building momentum and add to my confidence in KDP's future success. Our hard work in 2023 sharpened our strategic road map and bolstered our capabilities and financial profile providing a platform for growth and value creation in 2024 and over the long term.\nMoving now to our fourth quarter results. A primary focus for us last year have been rebuilding our margin structure. We made impressive gains in Q4, driving the strongest quarterly gross margin expansion in our history and the fastest rate of operating margin improvement in multiple years. This improvement was broad-based across each of our segments and enabled us to deliver EPS above the outlook we shared last quarter despite the impact of some transitory top line headwinds.\nQ4 constant currency net sales grew 1.1%, with net price realization more than offsetting a volume/mix decline. This result is not representative of our ongoing momentum and was, in part, weighed down by short-term factors in our U.S. coffee business that we do not expect to persist. We have good visibility to mid-single-digit consolidated net sales growth in 2024, which Sudhanshu will address in a few minutes.\nQ4 gross margin expanded 450 basis points, translating to gross profit dollar growth of 10% and helping to fund increased investments. Operating income increased at a high single-digit rate and EPS grew in the double digits. Notably, normalizing for nonoperational items in 2022, our Q4 underlying EPS growth rate was in the high teens. We continue to enjoy strong momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages. Net sales grew at a high single-digit rate in Q4, led by still very healthy net price realization and manageable elasticities with volume mix declining only modestly in the period, redouble focus on productivity and cost discipline along with strong C4 energy partnership execution, translated this topline to double-digit operating income growth.\nQ4 segment margins expanded meaningfully even as marketing continued to grow. As we observed back in October, though consumers remain largely resilient, value is a key shopping consideration. Many consumers are making trade-off decisions to manage stretch household budgets. As a result, value-oriented channels, such as club stores continue to outperform and consumers are inclined to shop more during deal periods such as holiday weeks.\nOur U.S. refreshment beverages business model is well suited to a dynamic macro environment. The breadth of the beverage occasions we serve and the depth of our distribution allow us to spot changing consumer trends with speed. We then flex our plans to deliver on the key tenets of our growth strategy, driving category growth, market share gains and white space expansion regardless of the operating environment.\nFourth quarter was no exception with dollar sales growth and share gains across 85% of our U.S. refreshment beverages business. CSDs grew nicely, led by Dr. Pepper, which was the largest market share gainer among the top 10 category brands for both the quarter and the year. During Q4, we once again activated our Fansville marketing campaign, the fuel awareness and drive demand. And despite Dr Pepper's existing scale, we grew incremental display and ACV for key varieties and pack sizes.\nDr. Pepper, strawberries and cream also remained highly resonant, finishing 2023 as the #1 innovation launch in the CSD category. In other parts of our portfolio, we leverage revenue growth management to ensure we are offering consumers continued compelling value across all channels and formats. For instance, in Q4, we deployed more multipacks and tailored promotional and merchandising strategies by channel for core hydration and Avion. As a result, our premium water portfolio grew retail dollars and notched market share gains, overcoming some consumer trade down to mainstream water.\nOur pursuit of white space opportunities continued in Q4, wrapping up a very active year. We exited the first year of our sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy with momentum. C4 commands less than a 3% share in energy today with meaningful upside ahead, and we have strong commercial plans to add significant further scale in 2024. We also just started shipping electrically through the KDP system, which will build our exposure to the fast-growing sports hydration category and multicultural consumers. A full innovation slate adds to our 2024 excitement. These include the launch of Dr. Pepper Creamy Coconut, just in time for the summer season. Canada Dry Fruit/CSD, Apple Mini bottles, the restage of Buy Wonder Water, 4 hydration partnering with Teen USA Symnastics and the national U.S. rollout of Penafiel, our powerhouse mineral water brand from Mexico.\nWe intend to leverage continued U.S. refreshment beverages top line growth to drive a balance of reinvestment and bottom line delivery in 2024. Over the past year, our commercial and supply chain teams have grown increasingly integrated, yielding significant efficiencies. As a result, our productivity savings run rate step changed in 2023, and we began 2024 with healthy carryover savings and a robust pipeline of additional projects to support P&L flow-through.\nIn U.S. coffee, we continue to control the controllables in the context of a still sluggish at-home coffee category. Our Q4 pod shipment trends improved relative to Q3, and we delivered another quarter of strong segment margin recovery and underlying operating income growth. We also ended this year having added approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig ecosystem in line with our target. That said, net sales declined 10% year-over-year as some short-term dynamics weighed on Q4 segment performance. As Sudhanshu will describe in detail, a combination of transient factors accounted for roughly half of the top line decline, and we expect these to dissipate in 2024.\nBigger picture, volume consumption in the at-home coffee category declined about 3% in 2023 in IRi tracked channels gradually recovering from a mid-single-digit decline in 2022. Q4 category trends were largely consistent with the full year. In both the quarter and the year, single-serve coffee continued to grow as a percent of total at-home coffee servings. And Keuring compatible brewers also gained meaningful share.\n2023, 4 out of 10 brewers sold were Keuring compatible. And in Q4, that ratio approached 50%. These are clear indications of our ecosystem's ongoing appeal to coffee drinking households. While at-home coffee category consumption is taking longer than we anticipated to return to growth to the back half of '23 was clearly stronger than the first, and we expect the gradual recovery to continue. Our 2024 U.S. coffee strategy incorporates a balance between long-term growth initiatives and short-term actions that address current macro realities. We will continue with high-quality brand and ecosystem building activities to drive incremental household penetration, increased pod usage among existing and new households and accelerate growth in ready-to-drink coffee. At the same time, we will emphasize affordability through revenue growth management initiatives such as engineering brewers to hit important entry price points. and highlighting the relative value of consuming coffee-at-home versus in coffee shops.\nFor higher income consumers, we continue to build out super premium solutions. These actions should support a broader at-home coffee recovery and ultimately help return the single-serve category to its long-term growth trend. Even so, we are building our 2024 financial plans around more prudent category growth assumptions. With more than 50 million coffee drinking households in the U.S. yet to convert to single-serve, there is significant runway to steadily grow penetration. We have an ambitious vision of Keuring future, some of which we will begin to share publicly starting this spring. At the annual Houseware Show in a few weeks, we will preview an exciting pipeline of disruptive innovation of Keuring brewers, and we will be making a public announcement about these innovation plans shortly before that event.\nOur 2024 pod program is equally robust. Innovation will span cold and hot occasions and a spectrum of brews and flavors. Along with incremental promotional and marketing support, these new products will directly bolster our owned and licensed brands. Products like refreshers will benefit our indulgent donut shop brand, while our high-profile collaboration with Kevin Costner will elevate Green Mountain. This is Costner's first brand campaign in 30 years and will feature the co-creation of a unique set of blends and integrated marketing events to highlight our shared passion for coffee quality and sustainability.\nWe remain focused on building out the super premium tier of pods, which reinforces Keurig's reputation for quality and supports premiumization in the category. Our latest activities began in Q4 with the introduction of lock alone licensed pods and continue in early 2024 with the conversion of Lavazza to a licensed relationship, which will unlock more growth and efficiencies for the brand.\nOur ready-to-drink coffee efforts are also gaining momentum. In Q4, we commenced our sales and distribution partnership for lock-on ready-to-drink coffee now with renovated products and packaging. Wrapping up on U.S. coffee, while we are not satisfied with our 2023 performance, we are taking steps to support a stronger 2024. We are acting as a category leader to revive long-term category growth, thinking expansively and disruptively with the vision, capabilities and willingness to invest in the future growth opportunities for ourselves and on behalf of our partners. In other words, we are being open-minded and ambitious and positioning KDP to benefit from an at-home coffee category rebound, while also planning 2024 in a measured way.\nMoving now to our International segment. Revenue grew at a double-digit rate on a reported basis and high single-digit rate in constant currency with continued balance between pricing and volume mix. As with our other segments, operating income grew faster than net sales, resulting in significant margin expansion. Our performance reflected healthy growth across country markets. Our results were led by strong trends across our cold beverages portfolio, primarily driven by Penafiel and Clamato in Latin America, Canada Dry and Dr. Pepper CSDs in Canada, and our continued expansion of our ready-to-drink alcohol and alcohol alternatives products.\nIn our international coffee business, we delivered strong household penetration growth in 2023 and this will remain a 2024 priority. For that aim, we recently inked an agreement to make sure the official coffee maker of the NFL in Canada, capitalizing on the sports growing popularity. Our international momentum is supported by broad-based capability investments, including in areas such as distribution and consumer insights. As in the U.S., our DSD system in Latin America represents a competitive advantage. During 2023, we bolstered our reach by expanding our routes and building out more dedicated coolers at retail and plan to do so again in 2024.\nMeanwhile, our innovation pipeline marries local expertise and enterprise-wide insights. For instance, the launch of Schweppes mocktails in LatAm will build on our experience in ready-to-drink low and no alcohol products in Canada. While the upcoming introductions of Dr. Pepper Dark Berry in Mexico, an expansion of 0 CSDs in Canada, leverage successful playbooks out of the U.S. Since merger, we have grown our international business at a strong double-digit CAGR from slightly over $1 billion in annual sales to almost $2 billion. We continue to see outsized growth potential in this segment, and it will remain a meaningful contributor to KDP's total results in 2024 and beyond.\nWrapping up, 2023 represented another year of delivering on our commitments while also advancing key strategic priorities. The operating environment is as ever demanding but our all-weather business model and energized teams are up to the challenge. Our focus remains on sustainably and thoughtfully extending our leadership position in the beverage industry while consistently delivering strong and predictable financial outcomes, including a return to our long-term algorithm in 2024.\nOn March 19, we will be hosting a webcasted investor event to dive deeper into our strategy and the multiple value creation opportunities we see across the business. We hope many of you will join or tune in.\nI will now turn the call briefly over to Tim, after which Sudhanshu will walk us through the detailed financial results and outlook.\n\nTimothy P. Cofer\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Central Garden & Pet Co.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. After joining KDP in November, I've spent the past 3 months fully immersing myself in the business as Chief Operating Officer, and in preparation for the CEO succession later this spring. My onboarding has exposed me to nearly every aspect of KDP, and most importantly, to its people. At the top of that list, Bob, Sudhanshu, our Board of Directors and the broader executive leadership team, with whom I've already forged strong and collaborative partnerships. I've spent time in multiple KDP locations from our headquarters in Dallas and Boston to the front lines of DSD retail as well as our cold and coffee manufacturing plants. I've met with many of our customers and partners and above all, listen to the valuable feedback from our employees.\nI also had an active hand in developing the 2024 plan that we're sharing with you today, and I echo Bob's confidence in KDP's ability to continue to deliver and create value for our shareholders. The investor event in a few weeks will be my first opportunity to share a more comprehensive view of my observations on the beverage industry, KDP as a market leader and our strategy to extend that leadership in the years ahead. I look forward to kicking off a deeper discussion at that time. For now, let me just say that I'm equally impressed by KDP's current strength as I am excited about the company's future potential. We are a leader in a very attractive industry. We steward many iconic brands that consumers love.\nOur commercial and distribution capabilities are differentiated. We are a preferred partner and have demonstrated an ability to evolve our portfolio in a way that broadens growth exposure and accomplishes it with capital responsibility. Finally, one of our greatest strengths is that we act with a challenger mindset. This is an important cultural element that attracted me to KDP and one which we plan to build upon going forward. Although Keurig Dr. Pepper is still a young company, our track record of strong and consistent financial delivery over a historically dynamic past 5 years is testament to our resilience and potential. I'm honored to build on such a formidable foundation and look forward to partnering with the Board and my colleagues to drive the next chapter of KDP's success. We have strong alignment and our commitment to deliver value to all stakeholders, including our shareholders. We're fortunate to have many long-term investors who have supported KDP since the merger, and we look forward to delivering for all of you in the years ahead.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Sudhanshu.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I will focus my remarks this morning primarily on our quarter 4 results and the 2024 outlook. Our Q4 performance demonstrated strong execution in a dynamic operating environment. We further rebuilt our margin structure, invested to seed future growth opportunities and delivered a strong EPS growth that was slightly ahead of our outlook. .\nFourth quarter net revenue advanced 1.7%, with 1.1% constant currency growth. Net price realization increased 4.8%, which was partially offset by a 3.7% decline in volume mix. We enjoyed strong momentum across approximately 70% of our business namely in U.S. refreshment beverages and international, but our top line growth was pressured by temporary headwinds in U.S. coffee. Gross margin expanded a record 450 basis points year-over-year, driven by a favorable net impact of pricing, productivity savings and moderating inflation. We also earned performance incentives relative to our strong commercial execution of the C4 partnership, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to gross margin.\nSG&A deleveraged 170 basis points, in part reflecting a double-digit increase in marketing. Total company operating income grew 6.5%, which, along with modest below-the-line leverage drove 10% EPS growth. Excluding the year-over-year reduction in nonoperational gains, EPS would have grown in the high teens. In 2023, we essentially eliminated nonoperational benefits. We now move into 2024, looking to build on this solid earnings base.\nMoving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages grew net sales 6.8%, led by 7.5 percentage points of pricing. Volume/mix declined a modest 0.7% with manageable elasticities, broad market share gains and a healthy growth contribution from C4 Energy. As Bob discussed, in 2024, we will build on our commercial momentum with a robust slate of innovation though our cadence of launches differ slightly from last year. For instance, our Dr Pepper Creamy coconut rollout will begin in quarter 2 and gain steam into the summer as opposed to the very successful launch of strawberries increased in quarter 1, 2023.\nWhile the calendar difference is made temporarily weigh on our market share comparison early in 2024, we remain confident in another great year for U.S. substation Beverages relative market performance. Segment operating income grew 20.2% in the quarter and margins expanded 360 basis points. This growth reflected the net sales momentum, a favorable impact of productivity net of inflation and the C4 performance incentives partially offset by higher marketing.\nIn U.S. coffee, we made good progress across multiple dimensions. Share gains for the single subsegment, and for Keuring continued. We executed a successful holiday approval program to end the year with 40 million Keuring households and the segment margins came in at the highest level in 10 quarters. These markers survive, we do not view the headline 9.9% net-well decline in quarter 4 as overly indicative. With pricing, a positive contributor, just shy of 1%, segment sales were pulled down by a 10.7% decrease in volume mix.\nLet me deconstruct drivers to give you a sense of why we see roughly half of the decline as transient. Brewer revenue decreased 21%, primarily due to a 14% decline in brewer shipments and reflecting a return of normal seasonal shipment patterns against a steadier point of sales trends. Looking at the back half in total is more telling with brewer shipments in line with point-of-sale purchases. As context, full year approval shipments in 2023 were 13% higher than pre-pandemic shipments in 2019, representing a 3% CAGR. Pod revenue declined 7% in the period, even with the continued impact from previously discussed private label exits, pod shipment trends sequentially improved as expected, down 3% in quarter 4 versus 8% last quarter. Pod revenue in the period was also unfavorably impacted by mix, given a lower percentage of sales from on in-licensed brand relative to last year.\nThe temporary headwinds in quarter 4 included the brewer decline, private label exits and a modest impact of lapping an extra week last year. Though quarter 1 will continue to reflect still sluggish category dynamics, we do expect these discrete factors to be less impactful beginning next quarter.\nMoving to segment operating profit and margins. Although quarter 4 operating income dollars declined 2.8% year-over-year, this was entirely due to the impact of lapping more than $50 million in nonoperational benefits. On an underlying basis, our operating income grew in the double digits. U.S. coffee operating margin expanded 260 basis points relative to the prior year. Drivers of this expansion included an improving relationship between pricing and inflation, continuous productivity benefits and overall cost discipline.\nIn 2024, reinvestment will be an important priority in the segment and will source from these margin tailwinds. International segment net sales grew 11.5% in the fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 6.5%, with pricing up 3.6% and volume mix growing 2.9%. We continue to deliver strong results across markets, despite tough year-over-year comparisons in Mexico from lapping the World Cup last year. Segment operating income increased a very strong 25.6% on a reported basis and 19.8% in constant currency terms, thanks to pricing, operating leverage and productivity mating favorably against iteration.\nAs President of our International segment, I see a tremendous multiyear top and bottom line growth opportunities across this business, including in 2024. Moving to balance sheet and cash flow. Our ongoing cash generation remains strong. However, we chose to deploy a significant component of our 2023 cash flow to strategically reduce our supplier financing program, a decision that optically weighed on our free cash flow even as it to strengthen our balance sheet.\nPut another way, our free cash flow for the year measured just north of $900 million, but included a $1.6 million use of cash from accounts payable, primarily due to our discretionary decision around the supplier financing program. Our business remains highly cash generative and on an ongoing basis, we continue to expect conversion commensurate with other leading beverage players. However, we will be below this long-term level in 2024 due to a continued a bit more modest impact from reducing supplier financing. How we intend to allocate our capital remains very much intact. Our priorities include making organic and inorganic investments to support our growth further strengthening our balance sheet, consistent with our long-term net leverage target of 2 to 2.5x and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and opportunistic share buybacks.\nIn any given year, we may over-index to 1 or more of our priorities based on short-term opportunities, but over time, we will take a balanced approach. For example, direct shareholder returns were a focus area during 2023, representing a cash deployment of over $1.8 billion. We saw value in our stock and repurchased 22 million shares during the year, including more than 8 million shares in quarter 4, with over $2.9 billion remaining on our buyback authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic. We also raised our dividend 7.5% during 2023, marking our third consecutive annual increase.\nMoving now to our 2024 guidance. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit constant currency net sales growth and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, consistent with our long-term algorithm. Based on our current FX outlook, we expect reported results to also incorporate roughly 50 basis points, top and bottom line currency headwind in 2024. Our plans reflect continued strong momentum in our U.S. Refreshment Beverages and international segments, while contemplating a relatively muted contribution from U.S. coffee.\nNew strategic partnerships will contribute approximately 200 basis points to overall top line growth which will also benefit from the combination of carryover pricing and selected new price actions consistent with a more normalized inflationary environment. We are projecting another year of robust productivity savings to help offset this more normal level of inflation. Even with planned reinvestments in our brand and capabilities, we expect healthy operating profit growth, reflecting net sales growth and full year operating margin expansion. However, we also anticipate some below-the-line headwinds primarily in interest expense. This will constrain some of the operating profit flow through to EPS, though we retain good visibility to bottom line growth within our high single-digit target range in 2024.\nOur full year outlook includes the following below-the-line assumptions. Interest expense in a $560 million to $580 million range, an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. From a phasing perspective, we expect our top and bottom line momentum to build throughout the year. This quarterly EPS flow is typical for us and accounts for our innovation and investment calendar as well as building contributions from electrolyte and lacalome in the back half.\nReflecting these dynamics and a slower start to the year in U.S. coffee, we forecast first quarter net sales and EPS growth in the low single digits. In closing, 2023 was a significant year for KDP. We grew share across most of our portfolio, increased gross margin through efficient pricing and record productivity, invested in key growth factors, improved the composition of our earnings profile and to strengthen our balance sheet. We expanded into attractive bite spaces through capital-efficient strategic partnerships and return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our 2023 performance was the product of hard work and strong execution across our whole organization, which enabled us to achieve a good set of operating and financial outcomes that were in line with our original projections. Our results also underscore our proven ability to deliver consistently and predictively in a dynamic operating environment. We have strong confidence that we will do so again in 2024.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back to Bob to close.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. Five years out from having played a key part in creating KDP, my excitement about its future continues to build. Our performance track record speaks for itself. In the 5 years since merger, net sales have grown at a 6% CAGR and EPS at an 11% CAGR. We have generated almost $11 billion in cumulative free cash with roughly half redeployed to bolster the business through transformational capital investments and disciplined M&A and partnership deals, which further enhance KDP's growth profile. .\nWe returned the other half to shareholders, enhancing our TSR delivery. We are looking forward to seeing many of you in mid-March and to sharing more about our go-forward strategic road map. KDP's priorities are very clear. They reinforce our role as a disruptive and dynamic force within the beverage industry and lend visibility to continued delivery against our attractive long-term growth algorithm. My confidence is made all the stronger, given the refreshed management team now in place with Tim's vision and energy already taking root and propelling KDP into its next chapter.\nThank you for dialing in during a busy day of cagny, we are now happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Third Quarter Of 2023. This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Special Projects, Wayfair, Inc.\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued two press releases, the first, detailing our third quarter 2023 results and the second, announcing our sales and distribution partnership with Grupo PiSA for Electrolit.\nDuring today's call and consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q3 performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes -- affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis while not in accordance with GAAP, provides investors with meaningful comparisons and appropriate insight into our business and operating performance trends. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.\nDue to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. We'll also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BodyArmor lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation.\nFinally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.\nHere with us today to discuss our results our KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; and our Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our Q3 results. KDP's diversified beverage portfolio and strong execution continue to support consistent delivery of our company goals and commitments, even as the operating environment around us remains dynamic.\nIn Q3, healthy organic sales growth and significant gross margin progress fueled reinvestment and bottom line growth, reinforcing the ability to our full year outlook, which remains unchanged.\nThird quarter constant currency net sales grew 4.1%. As expected, net price realization moderated from the first half but remain the primary top line growth driver, while volume mix strengthened sequentially.\nOur performance reflected continued share gains in U.S. Refreshment Beverages, gradual recovery in U.S. coffee segment results and strong momentum in our International business.\nGross profit margin expanded significantly, up 100 basis points year-over-year and the largest improvement in 4 years, reflecting an improved balance between ongoing inflation, pricing and productivity. Gross profit growth enabled us to continue reinvesting in the business, including increased marketing for the third consecutive quarter, while simultaneously driving bottom line growth which was slightly above the expectations we shared with you back in July.\nAs we move through Q4 and plan for next year, we expect our revenue growth drivers to continue to normalize as pricing moderates relative to recent history and volume mix continues to improve. To be clear, pricing is expected to remain a key part of the top line equation, especially considering that inflation is likely to persist, albeit at more moderate levels than over the last couple of years. Simultaneously, our focus will be on supporting volume mix by balancing margin flexibility between reinvestment and future top line growth and earnings flow-through.\nLet me take a step back and frame how we assess consumer health, our portfolio and our strategy in the macro environment. The consumer remains healthy with demand resilient and category elasticity is manageable. Even so, consumers are closely calibrating where and how they [ shop ]. For instance, growth in club and other value-oriented channels has accelerated while the convenience of e-commerce and pickup and delivery services continues to resonate well after any pandemic-related uplift would have normalized.\nConsumers remain responsive to high-quality innovation and activation, but price and package architecture is another increasingly important dimension, including smaller pack sizes that hit key price points and multipacks that offer value and convenience.\nOn the [ margin ], we also see some migration of lower to middle income households towards at-home meal and beverage occasions, which should benefit our more essential categories like CSDs and coffee. The business is well positioned against this backdrop, thanks to a compelling all-weather growth model. The ability to seamlessly meet the consumer across all beverage need states and to service those occasions across all channels is at the heart of why we formed this modern beverage company. Since then, we've made even more progress as we significantly grew the portfolio reach and strengthen our internal capabilities.\nLooking forward, our distribution prowess across retail is broad-based with very strong in-market execution yet we also enjoy a scaled online business, particularly on the coffee side. Our robust 2024 innovation pipeline has been well received by the trade and spans product, format and packaging news. It captures a combination of value and premium price points as well as low and no calorie and indulgent beverages. We also continue to price nimbly across the entirety of our portfolio, including by leveraging our strong mix management capabilities.\nIn short, the consumer is resilient but choiceful and KDP is positioned to drive attractive top line growth through a combination of volume, mix and price levers.\nOur successful growth model rests on our exclusive focus on North American beverages and a winning strategy. It begins with KDP's powerful twin distribution assets, our multichannel cold beverage distribution system, including DSD, and an installed base of nearly 40 million active households using the Keurig system. This is an unparalleled combination in the industry, which enhanced by strong R&D and commercial backbone, enables us to grow our categories and gain share across our base business and further build out our portfolio through high-value M&A and partnerships with counterparties who increasingly seek us out.\nWhen we fill in category white spaces, such as through our announcement today of the partnership with Electrolit, fuels a virtuous cycle of growth, investment and growing returns on that investment.\nAs the new brand scale and our portfolio expands, our capabilities get stronger. Drop sizes get bigger, our merchandising gets more impactful, we service each store and household more frequently and our commercial and consumer relationships tighten. This enables further investment in growth that begins to cycle anew.\nWe have proven this model over multiple years. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, we have consistently outperformed our categories, growing dollar share in at least 75% of our business in all but 2 quarters since the beginning of 2019.\nWe also entered multiple strategic white spaces within the past 12 months such as ready-to-drink coffee, energy and after today's announcement, sports hydration, all were achieved in a very capital-efficient manner.\nThe growth path ahead is increasingly evident with both owned and partner brands. The latter, where our relationships are strategic and long term, growth and mix are positive, and our economics are attractive.\nCoffee, the single-serve segment has continued to steadily gain share of at-home coffee, cementing Keurig's leadership position with this important category. At the same time, we are expanding our total coffee strategy to encompass iced, ready-to-drink and other forms of coffee within and beyond the K-Cup format.\nAnd in Canada and Mexico, we have leveraged similar strategies across our Refreshment Beverages and coffee business as well as deeply experienced local teams to build a combined business approaching $2 billion in revenue, with a mid-20s operating margin. As a result, our International segment has become a scaled contributor to the overall portfolio with significant growth runway ahead.\nI'll now briefly discuss how this strategy played out in Q3, with Sudhanshu to follow with greater detail and guidance. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, 82% of our business outpaced category growth in the quarter. CSD business is healthy. Dr Pepper building on the momentum of strawberries and cream earlier in the year, with a successful sixth season of the iconic Fansville marketing campaign.\nOther brands such as Canada Dry and Squirt also saw -- gains. And Polar's momentum continued in sparkling water, where it now commands the #2 volume share position.\nCORE and Evian remains strong drivers in premium waters with CORE, in particular, seeing great traction from our partnership with U.S. gymnastics. That said, work to do elsewhere in the still portfolio including with buy, is undergoing a significant restage and reformulation next year.\nImportantly, our partnership with Nutrabolt on C4 is proceeding very well. In Q3, C4's market share and earned display accelerated while velocities remain strong across those regions where KDP has taken control of the brand throughout the market. Even as the C4 rollout continues in its first year, we have significant room for future growth in energy, where KDP's market share is only 3%, and C4 has tremendous potential.\nWith the Electrolit announcement today, we are extending our portfolio into the large and important sport hydration category, another quickly growing mix accretive white space for KDP. Electrolit is a brand that has established a strong regional foothold, thanks to its unique product attributes, scientific heritage and extremely loyal customer base.\nThe brand is the market leader in sports hydration in Mexico, and that popularity extends to the U.S. where Electrolit enjoys broad multicultural -- but over-indexes with Hispanic consumers. Though it has good scale today in the U.S. and already generates more than $400 million in retail sales, representing more than a tenfold increase over the past 5 years, Electrolit has significant upside potential.\nWe are excited to partner with Grupo PiSA, Electrolit's parent company, to meaningfully expand the brand's distribution breadth and depth in the U.S. and across all channels while also leveraging KDP's commercial expertise to further enhance the brand's position at retail.\nWith C4, -- and Electrolit having entered our portfolio over the last 12 months, we have meaningfully increased the growth potential for each of these brands while extending a positive halo on the rest of our business. For example, our total volume in chain convenience stores will increase by approximately 50% after incorporating these brands, providing scale and efficiency benefits across the entirety of our portfolio. This is the virtuous cycle that I described just a few minutes ago and which will continue to fuel KDP's success.\nTurning now to U.S. coffee, where our back half is focused on driving segment margin improvement in the context of gradually improving at-home coffee category volumes. With visible progress on both fronts, let's address each in turn.\nI'll start with the segment margin improvement. We have a greater ability to control in the short term than we do with category trends. Q3, we began to deliver against our objective with a strong inflection in segment margins and operating income, which meaningfully improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Importantly, we expect the margin improvements to continue.\nWe previously said that delayed pricing would flow through our partner brands, and it has. We have now strengthened the pricing protocols across these long-term partnerships and do not expect any significant lag between inflation and pricing to recur in the future. Plus, commodity cost headwinds are now moderating and productivity is building across the segment, enhancing our visibility to continuing to grow the bottom line even with ongoing reinvestment.\nMoving to category performance. At-home coffee category volume growth accelerated relative to Q2 but the pace of recovery is admittedly gradual. From Q2 to Q3, volume trends across the broader category strengthened by about 100 basis points in measured channels though volumes are still modestly lower year-over-year.\nSingle-serve continues to gain share of at-home coffee with our proprietary data, which is more comprehensive spanning both measured and untracked channels, indicating that Q3 Keurig's compatible pod consumption volume was approximately flat versus a year ago, proving from down approximately 3% in Q2. These green shoots are encouraging, and we will continue to nurture them as the single-serve market share leader.\nDuring the quarter, we saw our competitors begin to lean more aggressively into price promotions in the single-serve category, resulting in some share shifts across the various brands in the ecosystem. As a reminder, because we manufacture nearly 80% of all Keurig compatible pods in the U.S., we tend to participate even share changes occur between our branded and private label partner brands and our owned and licensed brands. Nevertheless, we must responsibly manage our owned and licensed brands price gaps within the category and intend to stay nimble to the changing operating conditions around us. Importantly, as we choose to surgically respond to the recent price activity, we expect segment margins to accelerate in Q4.\nWe also do not expect the competitive pricing activity to meaningfully accelerate at-home coffee category buying, which we know are far more responsive to high-quality activities that influence consumer choice and lean into emerging trends.\nAs the single-serve leader, KDP will continue to drive category growth as we always have through innovation, renovation and white space expansion that build penetration with new households and increased usage among our existing consumers. With 90 million U.S. households drinking coffee at home, of which fewer than 40 million are actively using Keurig brewers, there is a significant multiyear opportunity ahead.\nIn 2024, we will continue to pursue that growth through new consumables like cold brew, expanded ice varieties and refreshers. New brands like La Colombe, which, by the way, begins to ship in ready-to-drink and K-Cup format starting in Q4, significantly new innovation in brewers, all supported by strong marketing and brand activation activity, including exciting new collaborations across our owned and licensed brands.\nMoving on to our International performance in Q3, which remained impressive with revenue growth once again, in double digits and continued segment margin expansion. Both our Coffee and Refreshment Beverages businesses performed well.\nCanada, the ready-to-drink alcohol and no alcohol segment is growing, and we are contributing to that growth. ATP gained significant share as velocity and distribution built and a blast from the past, vodka-based [ Tahiti Treat RTD ] generated exceptional consumer demand.\nIn Mexico, our powerhouse [ Pennytel ] and Squirt brands, both grew at a double-digit rate, leveraging our strong go-to-market and DSD capabilities behind which we continue best. In Mexico, like in the U.S., we have significant growth potential ahead across both our core portfolio and through partnerships as we leverage these unique distribution assets.\nKDP's strong balance sheet and cash generation profile are powerful enablers of our broader growth strategy with today's Electrolit announcement yet another example of how we can grow our portfolio and market reach in a highly capital-efficient manner. As a result, our financial policy approach can be flexible and dynamic.\nThis year, we are deploying some of our cash flow to strategically reduce our supplier financing program. Simultaneously, we announced a 7.5% increase in our annual dividend furthering our track record of regularly growing dividend income for our shareholders.\nWith over $3 billion remaining on our share buyback authorization and having already repurchased 24 million shares of KDP stock over the last 2 years, we have substantial flexibility to opportunistically lean in when we see compelling value in the business we know best.\nWrapping up, our third quarter results represented another period of consistent delivery against our commitments. Our top line growth was strong and resilient and we reinvested in our brands and differentiated capabilities. We also achieved important proof points in our margin recovery journey this quarter as visible in our consolidated gross margin progress, and in U.S. Coffee segment results.\nOur Q3 results provide enhanced visibility to our unchanged 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. We expect to close out 2023 having significantly improved our composition of earnings profile, lending further support to our aspiration to be on algorithm in 2024.\nI'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated third quarter results were solid. Top line growth was resilient, and supported future momentum by reinvesting in the business and we delivered modest EPS upside relative to the expectations we shared with you last quarter.\nRevenue advanced 5.1% to $3.8 billion with healthy constant currency sales growth of 4.1%. Pricing remained the primary growth driver, contributing 5.5 points as expected by the moderation from the second quarter as prior year pricing actions were lapped. Volume/mix strengthened sequentially, posting a modest 1.4% decline year-over-year. Gross profit margin inflected positively in the quarter and expanded a strong 100 basis points year-over-year as pricing and efficiency gains begin to offset input cost inflation.\nTotal SG&A deleveraged 130 basis points year-over-year, reflecting our focus to reinvest in our brands and capabilities while combating sustained inflation. SG&A saw another quarter of double-digit increases in marketing spending, while transportation, warehousing and other corporate costs such as labor remains [indiscernible].\nAdjusted operating income grew 3.1%, which, combined with below-the-line leverage, resulted in mid-single-digit EPS growth to $0.48, slightly ahead of the guidance we shared last quarter. We achieved this result without the benefit of any nonoperational gains in the quarter as we continue to make progress on reinforcing our earnings base looking out to next year.\nMoving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages grew net sales 5.9%, led by 7.1 percentage points of pricing. The price contribution moderated quarter-over-quarter as anticipated as we begin to anniversary some of the last year's pricing activity. Volume/mix declined 1.2%, reflecting outperformance versus our categories across the vast majority of our portfolio and the growth contribution from C4 Energy. As Bob said, we expect price to remain a continued driver of the top line growth algorithm in quarter 4 and into next year, even as growth rebalances across volume, mix and pricing contributions. Consumer is resilient, category elasticities are manageable and inflation -- moderating remains a headwind.\nSegment operating income grew 6.1% in the quarter and segment margins were approximately flat year-over-year. This performance reflected the favorable impact of pricing and productivity, net of inflation, offset by increased investment in marketing.\nIn U.S. Coffee, net sales decreased 3.2%, improving versus the second quarter trough as expected. Pricing sequentially strengthened and contributed 3.1 percentage points of growth. Some of this reflected pricing that lagged realized inflation across our partner portfolio and is now flowing through after a delay. In future cycles, we expect the pricing pass-through necessary to offset inflation to be more seamless. Volume/mix declined 6.3% year-over-year in quarter 3.\nBrewers grew 8% as we moved past destocking in the first half and shift in for the important holiday period. For the back half, as a whole, we expect brewer shipments to track point-of-sale strength, which remains softer in today's macro environment and are still declining in the mid- to high single digits compared to last year. Importantly, Keurig brewers continue to gain share within the coffee maker category and we still expect to finish the year having grown penetration to approximately 40 million households in the Keurig ecosystem as compared to approximately 38 million at the end of 2022.\nAll shipments declined 8%, similar to last quarter. However, by our measure, category consumption volume in single serve were flat year-over-year across all channels, a sequential improvement relative to quarter 2.\nAs we previewed would happen last quarter, shipments lagged category consumption in the period due primarily to two factors: First, the competition against a year ago channel inventory build; and second, the volume impact from our decision to exit certain low-margin private label contracts. We anticipate a smaller combined impact from these factors in quarter 4 and expect all shipments to sequentially strengthen relative to quarter 3.\nOffice segment operating income grew 5.7% and operating margins expanded strongly. At near 33%, segment operating margins increased 280 basis points versus the prior year and also compared very favorably relative to 30.4% in the first half. The significant infection was driven by pricing, productivity and moderating inflation, and we expect it to sustain.\nAs Bob mentioned, the part of the expected revenue recovery is slightly altered relative to our original plan due to some prudent price arrangement in a competitive environment. Nevertheless, margin trends are expected to accelerate further in quarter 4. Fundamental progress is expected to drive continued solid operating income growth year-over-year even as we lap a difficult comparison given nonoperational benefits partially contributed to U.S. Coffee operating income last year.\nInternational segment sales increased 20.8% in the third quarter against a double-digit growth [indiscernible] in the year-ago period. Constant currency sales growth was very strong at 12.9%, with volume/mix increasing 9% and pricing up 3.9%. Our top line momentum are broad-based across Mexico and Canada.\nSegment operating income grew very strongly at 39.4% on a reported basis and 31.7% in constant currency terms, thanks to operating leverage and efficiency gains netting favorably against inflation. And anticipated, our free cash flow conversion strengthened sequentially in the third quarter to $459 million, reflecting the combination of profit growth and moderating working capital users and consistent with our expectation for free cash flow conversion to strengthen in the second half.\nOur capital allocation approach remains unchanged. Our priorities include organic and inorganic investments to support our growth, further strengthening our balance sheet, consistent with our long-term net leverage ratio target of 2 to 2.5x, and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share buybacks. We dynamically adjust between these priorities on an ongoing basis.\nIn quarter 3, we closed on the highly strategic La Colombe partnerships first introduced in July, which included a $300 million equity investment. Today, we announced another important partnership with Grupo PiSA to sell, distribute and merchandise Electrolit in the U.S. This is a meaningful step forward into sports hydration for KDP and establishes another mix accretive growth platform, even as it comes with minimal capital commitments.\nAs Bob pointed out, with entries into energy, RTD coffee and sports hydration over the past 12 months, we have penetrated three large and important white spaces for a relatively modest capital outlay of less than $1.3 billion.\nWe also have the ability and desire to continue to return cash to our shareholders. In September, we announced a 7.5% increase, marking our third consecutive year of growing our dividend and representing a cumulative 43% increase over that time. Our CRE purchases will remain opportunistic and we have demonstrated a willingness step in when our share price becomes dislocated from the long-term value we expect to create. The approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, we will continue to assess the market for such opportunities.\nMoving now to guidance. We are reaffirming our consolidated outlook for 2023 and continue to target constant currency net sales growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. Our EPS outlook assumes minimal benefits from nonoperational items in 2023, implying double-digit EPS growth on an underlying basis.\nOur guidance for below-the-line items is consistent with last quarter. For the year, we continue to expect interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range, effective tax rate of 22% and approximately $1.41 billion diluted -- average shares outstanding. We expect a strong end to the year in quarter 4 with similar top line dynamics in quarter 3 and even a stronger gross margin expansion. At the same time, we will be lapping approximately $67 million of nonoperational gains in last year's fourth quarter, primarily concentrated in the U.S. Coffee segment, which creates a challenging comparison. Blending these factors together, we expect Q4 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.54 or 8% year-over-year growth. On an underlying basis, this represents strong double-digit EPS growth.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. I'd like to close by saying how excited we all are that [ Tim Cofer ] has joined KDP as Chief Operating Officer on November 6. From there, we are looking forward to a smooth CEO transition between Tim and me in Q2 next year in continuity as I serve as KDP's Executive Chairman thereafter.\nUpon joining KDP, Tim's immediate focus will be immersing himself in the business. He will also partner with Sudhanshu, the full executive leadership team and me to drive our annual operating planning process for 2024. A lot of robust work is underway, and we expect to provide you with a detailed outlook when we report our Q4 results.\nFor now, let me just say that our entire organization is focused on delivering a strong finish to 2023. We expect that Tim will join Sudhanshu and me in this forum in February and I know you will enjoy meeting him after that.\nI'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.",

KDP second quarter once again demonstrated our portfolio's resilience and ability to consistently deliver on our total company commitments. Our solid performance was driven by strength in U.S. refreshment beverages, encouraging developments in U.S. Coffee and continued momentum in international.\nConsolidated Q2 results were healthy, with strong revenue momentum and sequentially accelerating operating income and EPS growth. Net sales advanced more than 6%, supported by net price realization, modest category elasticities and good share performance across much of our portfolio.\nFor the first time since Q3 2021, reported gross margins expanded as an improving balance between pricing, inflation and productivity began to emerge. Gross profit dollar growth funded marketing increases across all segments and helped to offset continued cost pressures in transportation, warehousing and labor.\nAs we forecasted, we are in the early stages of a margin recovery that we expect to become more visible in the back half. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we are raising our 2023 net sales growth outlook to 5% to 6%. While our full year EPS outlook is optically unchanged, it in fact represents greater than originally anticipated underlying growth with an enhanced composition to our earnings profile.\nAs Sudhanshu will discuss in more detail, we now expect minimal nonoperational items in 2023, setting KDP up for strong and sustainable earnings base from which to grow in 2024 and beyond. U.S. Refreshment Beverages performance in Q2 was outstanding; double-digit revenue growth and strong operating margin expansion.\nSimilar to last quarter, category growth and our own momentum remained pricing-led. Limited volume elasticities across the portfolio. Though demand is resilient, we are mindful of the various pressures facing our consumers and are proactively meeting their needs through product and package innovation along with strong in-market execution. When these elements come together, we see market share gains.\nQ2, these were most notable across our CSDs, sparkling water, coconut water and juice portfolio. Even as price realization begins to moderate in the back half, we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive organic growth by creating value among 3 key dimensions.\nFirst, by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation. Second, by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships. And third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system.\nWe delivered on each of these dimensions in Q2. Focusing first on our core brands. For the second consecutive quarter, Dr Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category, bolstered by the success of Strawberries & Cream and the continued strong momentum of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, which was once again named a top 2 food and beverage product in IRI-Sircana's new product pacesetter innovation rankings.\nKeurig also continue to outperform driven by its multicultural appeal. In unsweetened sparkling waters, our partnership with Polar has now boosted the brand to the #2 volume share position nationally. We also brought significant excitement to our juice categories where Mott's’ and Hawaiian Punch are driving innovation and gaining share.\nWhen it comes to partnerships, our C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. 2023 is a year of transition and investment and though it is still early days in our distribution rollout, we are driving gains across multiple metrics and remain confident in the growth potential of C4.\nIn KDP distributed geographies, total points of distribution increased nearly 60% versus prior year, and weighted weeks on display across large format food outlets are up nearly 15% relative to the beginning of 2023. These gains translated into continued velocity and share momentum for C4 and accelerated the brand's already strong revenue growth even further.\nClearly, our partnership approach continues to create win-win outcomes, making this model increasingly attractive to other high-potential companies including La Colombe, which I'll speak more about shortly.\nThe effectiveness of our selling and distribution engine underpins our success across all the examples I cited. I want to acknowledge the hard work our teams have done to drive improvement across the system where it showed signs of strain during the pandemic.\nCustomer service levels are now significantly improved relative to where we were during the COVID period and, in some cases, exceed prepandemic comparisons. Though our work here is never complete, these strides are leading to even tighter in-store and on-shelf execution as our market share momentum demonstrates.\nTurning now to U.S. Coffee, where exiting Q2, we saw several encouraging developments that are expected to benefit segment performance over the coming quarters. On our last earnings call, I identified 3 key tenets underpinning our expectations in this segment.\nFirst, that at-home coffee category momentum would begin to recover in the back half as mobility comparisons ease. Second, that we would add approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig's ecosystem in 2023, aided by brewer and pot innovation and the addition of new brands. And third, that segment operating margins would improve meaningfully in the back half, supported by a better balance between pricing, inflation and productivity.\nWe have even more visibility to these elements playing out today with Q2 marking an expected trough in both top line growth and margins.\nLet's address each point in turn. First, as anticipated, at-home coffee category momentum began to improve towards the end of the second quarter and has continued to do so in July. Amount of time our consumers are spending at home this year versus last is continuing to normalize. Since we believe time spent at home is the single largest variable driving at-home coffee consumption, it follows that volume trends are recovering too.\nWe are observing this across broader at-home coffee within which single-serve continues to gain share. Category recovery is very clear when looking at publicly syndicated data. In Q1, Keurig compatible pod volumes, good proxy for the total single-serve category, declined nearly 4% across measured channels.\nQ2, these declines moderated to less than 2%, with improvement particularly notable towards the end of the quarter. For the last 4 weeks, category volumes are flat to up slightly. Notably, category and KDP volume performance has been even stronger in nontrack channels, such as e-commerce and unmeasured club.\nCategory trend is a positive leading indicator for our business, and we would expect sequential improvement in net sales growth in the back half. That said, we are prepared for our volume growth to lag the single-serve category in the shorter term as we focus on optimizing profitability. Pricing across all subsegments of our K-Cup portfolio is now more fully flowing through our financials, including from our partner brands, consistent with our previous expectation that pricing would catch up to inflation but at a delay.\nWe also exited some of our lowest margin private label contracts. Both of these elements are now filtering through our results and the syndicated data. Longer term, our growth in U.S. Coffee will remain underpinned by driving incremental household penetration for the Keurig system and increasing revenues from our existing 38 million active households, which brings me to the second tenet of our coffee outlook, driving incremental household penetration.\nIn Q2, we furthered this growth strategy by elevating our presence in cold coffee, which is an important trend among younger consumers. This spring, we nationally expanded the K Ice Brewer platform and specially formulated iced K-Cup pods, strong marketing and activation activities across all media and digital channels, including a special limited edition Rolling Stones K Ice Brewer that sold out in less than 24 hours.\nThese innovations are off to a very strong start with the K Ice Brewer family performing extremely well and our ice pods proving highly incremental to our base business. Just last week, we announced a strategic partnership with La Colombe, super premium and award-winning coffee brand with wide appeal and untapped potential.\nPartnership, which includes an equity investment, a sales and distribution agreement for RTD Coffee and a K-Cup pod licensing agreement is a compelling example of our ability to add value to a single partner across both hot and cold beverages, which KDP is uniquely positioned to deliver.\nOur collaboration with La Colombe will encompass several exciting strategic avenues. We will leverage our sales and distribution capability to scale La Colombe across major retail classes of trade.\nAlong with the brand, we are creating a ready-to-drink coffee platform, which will enable us to better serve the needs of our consumers and retail customers in this important category. We will also work closely with La Colombe to formulate and introduce the brand into the Keurig ecosystem in a K-Cup format.\nHere too, we are building a super premium platform as La Colombe joined several recently added brands like Intelligentsia, Black & Bold and Philz. Additionally, La Colombe's vertically integrated model and specialized manufacturing knowledge are other differentiated elements that could enhance our collaboration over time. In short, this partnership has strong value creation potential that when unlocked will benefit both KDP and La Colombe through our joint ownership model.\nNow moving to the third element driving our coffee outlook. We continue to expect segment margins for the U.S. coffee segment to meaningfully improve both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. We Multiple factors led to segment margin contraction over the last 2 years and several elements, including sequential favorability in pricing, commodity costs and productivity are now starting to come together to facilitate a margin rebuild.\nPricing to offset cumulative inflation across our K-Cup portfolio, including for partner and private label brands, will now [indiscernible] fully flow through starting in Q3. Commodity cost pressures including in green coffee and packaging are also projected to ease.\nEfficiency benefits should ramp up throughout the year as we have redoubled our productivity efforts following a period focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions. We will work to further enhance these elements going forward with the expected back half margin inflection, an important marker for future profit growth.\nOur International segment continues to perform well, even as it begins to lap double-digit growth in the year ago period. Q2 Canadian volume momentum was fueled by nonalcoholic and low alcohol beverages, where we have multiple brands like [indiscernible] gaining share. This is an exciting set of emerging categories where we plan to leverage our learnings across markets.\nExecution also remained strong in our Canadian coffee business where KDP manufactured pods grew consumption dollars and gained market share during the period. Mexico, our DSD network, continues to strengthen, which is supporting broad-based share momentum across our LRB portfolio and the ongoing rollout of our partnership with Red Bull.\nAcross the portfolio, Penafiel and its [indiscernible] extensions into flavored sparkling waters as well as our CSD brands continue to perform very well.\nWrapping up our consolidated Q2 results are yet another illustration of our modern beverage company working to deliver strong, consistent and predictable company performance. We continue to develop our business for the long term through investments in innovation, partnerships and capabilities while demonstrating our ability to work through shorter-term normalization in coffee.\nWe also continue to deploy our cash to create value for shareholders. We saw this via the equity investment in La Colombe and through the opportunistic repurchase of KDP shares, which continued through Q2 as our share price remained dislocated.\nWe are raising our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth to 5% to 6% and and reaffirming our guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%, with an improving composition of our earnings profile. We now expect only minimal nonoperational benefits within the framework of this guidance implying double-digit adjusted EPS growth on an underlying basis.\nI'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu to discuss Q2 results and our balance of year outlook in greater detail.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our consolidated quarter 2 results, which represented another quarter of strong sales growth with reported gross margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year and significant reinvestment in marketing.\nReported sales advanced 6.6% to $3.8 billion with 6.1% organic growth, reflecting strong pricing and a modest decline in volume/mix. Consolidated top line momentum was driven by U.S. Refreshment Beverages and International segments, partially offset by a trough quarter in U.S. Coffee, which we anticipated.\nReported gross margin expanded slightly year-over-year to 54.8% as we made progress in offsetting ongoing inflation. This is an important change in trend after nearly 2 years. Even with continued cost pressures across transportation, warehousing and labor, we reinvested significantly in marketing with increases across each segment.\nAs a result, total SG&A and the percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 4.4% and additional below-the-line leverage helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.42, 7.7% above prior year.\nWe continue to deploy our cash in accordance with our evolved capital allocation priorities. Over the past 4 quarters, we have opportunistically repurchased nearly 22 million KDP shares, including 7 million shares in quarter 2 in recognition of a significant long-term opportunity in our stock. Combined with our quarterly dividend, we have returned approximately $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders over this timeframe.\nIn addition, since the merger, we have evolved our ownership structure to that of the modern beverage company we are today, increasing KDP's public float from 13% in 2018 to 73% today. This includes the exit of Mondelez, which earlier this month completed its final sale of the long-term strategic equity stake it took as part of the KGM Tech Private in 2016.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to strategically invest in promising partnership and M&A opportunities namely the $300 million investment we made in La Colombe announced last week.\nKDP's successful track record in scaling beverage bands and strengthening our leadership positions across our key categories make us a sought-after partner for high potential companies and brand owners. We remain and disciplined around such opportunities, seeking out only those that has compelling strategic merit, create win-win outcomes for both parties and provide significant value creation potential.\nTurning now to segment performance. U.S. Refreshment Beverages sales grew an impressive 11.8% led by 12 percentage points from pricing with virtually no volume/mix impact. This resilient volume/mix performance continued to reflect the strength of our portfolio, ongoing market share gains, manageable category elasticities in the face of significant pricing and the contribution from C4 Energy.\nSegment operating income increased 18.1% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points, as pricing and productivity benefits more than offset commodity, manufacturing and labor inflation and an increase in marketing investment. In U.S. Coffee, sales declined 5.7% with positive pricing more than offset by anticipated volume/mix pressure, which I will further explain now.\nFocusing first on the consumable pods business. As Bob indicated, we are encouraged by the improving consumption volume trends in the single subcategory exiting the first half. We see this category trend as the leading indicator for the direction of our business.\nHowever, in quarter 2, our reported pod shipment declines had yet to reflect any improvement due to 3 primary factors: first, a category volume recovery began later in the period, and therefore, had a limited impact on quarterly results. Second, we lapped a period last year when we were replenishing retailer and partnered inventories after supply chain disruptions, creating a difficult shipment completion. And third, our conjunction and shipment volumes were impacted by our decision to exit some low-value private label contracts.\nWe expect some lingering impact to our shipment volume from factors I and II as we move into quarter 3. Even so, revenue trends are projected to sequentially strengthen, driven by positive pricing and moderating volume declines.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, brewer shipments declined 11% year-over-year. For perspective, our brewer volume is still 18% higher than the comparable 12-month period ending quarter 2, 2019, which represents a clean prepandemic compression. The point here is that despite all the volatility of the last several years, surging demand during the height of COVID and the later stages of normalization we are working through, demand for Keurig ecosystem is greater today than it was 4 years ago among both consumers and retail partners.\nOur Q2 brewer shipment declined 10.9%, a sequential improvement relative to quarter 1 and were impacted by the same factors we discussed last quarter. These include softer discretionary demand for smaller appliances including brewers, which saw mid-single-digit consumption declines and additional a bit moderating pressures from trade inventory rebalancing.\nAfter 2 quarters of inventory adjustments, we believe these are largely behind us, looking out to the back half. Importantly, Keurig branded brewers, gained share of all coffeemakers sold in quarter 2, with recently launched Ki Brewers seeing good traction in the market.\nWe will further support these new brewers and highly incremental ice pods in the back half, as we continue to expand our cold coffee platform and offerings. U.S. Coffee operating income contracted 14.6% at 30.1% segment margins were similar to quarter 1 level, but 310 basis points lower year-over-year.\nVersus the prior year, this performance reflected a continued unfavorable relationship between pricing and inflation as well as a significant investment in higher marketing in part support our ICE innovation launches.\nLooking to the back half of the year in U.S. Coffee, we forecast a gradual recovery in revenue growth coupled with significantly improved margins. This combination underpins our outlook for a strong rebound in the segment operating income with positive growth in quarter 3 to be followed by very attractive gains in quarter 4.\nOur International segment performance in quarter 2 remained strong even as we lapped tougher year ago comparisons. Net sales increased 10.9% on a reported basis with constant currency growth of 7%. Net price realization contributed 6.1% and volume/mix was up 0.9% year-over-year.\nSegment operating income grew 11.5% on a reported basis and 7.7% in constant currency reflecting the benefit of the growth in net sales and increased productivity, partially offset by inflationary pressures and a significant increase in marketing investment.\nTurning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million in the second quarter. As we enter the seasonally more cash-generative back half, we would expect our absolute levels of free cash flow as well as free cash conversion to meaningfully improve from here.\nThis brings me to our consolidated outlook for 2023, which we updated in our press release this morning. Our outlook for constant currency net sales growth is now higher at 5% to 6%, and we continue to expect adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%.\nWhile our EPS outlook is unchanged on the surface, expected profile of our earnings is now further improved relative to our guidance earlier this year. Specifically, you will recall that 2022 benefited from several nonoperational items. And at the start of this year, we expected to reduce the use of these items by approximately 50% in 2023.\nI am pleased to share that our EPS forecast now includes only minimal such benefits. As a result, on an underlying basis, our EPS growth is now projected to be in the double digits versus our prior expectations for a high single-digit gain. This very strong underlying performance demonstrates the earnings power inherent in KDP's model.\nIt is also effectively an increase to our 2023 growth outlook and will preclude any further upside to EPS expectations for this year, while setting us up for a strong and sustainable base from which KDP can grow earnings in 2024.\nOur full year guidance includes the following expectations for below-the-line items. Interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range. Equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million. An effective tax rate of 22% for the year. And approximately 1.41 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nWe have covered a lot of ground stays, so I will just finish by remarking on the projected savings of earnings for the balance of the year. Given the evolution of pricing, inflation and productivity, along with the timing of planned reinvestments over the back half, we expect only modest EPS growth in quarter 3 followed by very strong results in quarter 4.\nWith a good first half in the books and the enhanced visibility to the balance of the year, we are confident in a robust finish to 2023.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. If you haven't done so already, I encourage all of you to read our 2022 corporate responsibility report, which was published last month. Highlighted within its pages is the significant work KDP is doing to further our sustainability agenda.\nWe're very proud of our progress across multiple focus areas, including in renewable energy, water stewardship and diversity and inclusion.\nTo close, Q2 was a very good quarter for KDP across multiple dimensions. Performance in U.S. Refreshment Beverages was once again exceptional and International posted another great quarter. U.S. Coffee is approaching an important inflection with improved visibility to a significant margin recovery which we expect to lead the strong operating income growth as we close out this transitional year for the segment.\nOn a consolidated basis, our efforts to offset inflation are increasingly evident in gross margin stability and marketing reinvestment across all segments. And as we discussed today, full year guidance implies double-digit underlying EPS growth with an even stronger top line outlook. These are all key elements that set us up for ongoing momentum in the back half, and ultimately, into next year.\nI will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the First Quarter of 2023. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce the company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\n\nJane Gelfand\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Special Projects, Wayfair, Inc.\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our first quarter results. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends.\nWhile the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates are not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation table included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.\nBeginning this quarter, we will discuss our performance in accordance with our recently redefined business segments, which were described in the 8-K filed last Thursday, April 20. This new segment structure is more consistent with how we evaluate the business internally and provides more visibility to our segment performance in the U.S., which is our largest market.\nWe will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BODYARMOR lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation.\nAnd finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We started 2023 with good momentum. Our overall Q1 performance came in largely as expected and demonstrated the resilience of the modern beverage company we have built. We continue to manage well against a dynamic macro environment with the diversification benefits of KDP's model evident in our results.\nThis morning, we reaffirmed our 2023 outlook, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our commitments as a company. For the quarter, consolidated net sales advanced a strong 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted EPS grew 3%. Consumer demand remained healthy driven by successful renovation and innovation, increased investment in marketing and modest elasticities across much of our portfolio.\nA narrowing gap between inflation and pricing coupled with increased productivity and favorable mix contributed to good flow-through to gross profit, though we continue to work through significant ongoing inflation in transportation, warehousing and labor costs. We expect the balance between these operating income drivers to turn more favorable in the back half of the year.\nIn U.S. refreshment beverages, which represents nearly 60% of KDP consolidated revenue, our strong performance in Q1 demonstrated the depth of our capabilities across multiple dimensions including brand renovation, marketing, distribution and in-market execution as well as our partnership philosophy and successful track record.\nAs discussed previously, we create value in U.S. refreshment beverages in 3 ways: by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation, by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships and by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including our company-owned direct store delivery system. The multiplier effect of all 3 of these elements working in unison was evident in Q1.\nWe gained share in categories representing almost 90% of retail sales. With strong momentum in core brands, particularly Dr. Pepper, Crush and Mott's. On the back of the very successful launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream, brand Dr Pepper recorded the largest market share gain in the CSD category this quarter. In fact, the brand has become the #1 flavored CSD in syndicated data over the past 13 weeks.\nFor perspective, Strawberries & Cream reached 70% ACV distribution within 5 weeks of launch, quickly gained a full share point in the CSD category and continues to experience strong momentum. Driving the early success of Strawberries & Cream is KDP's direct store delivery engine and robust consumer insights and marketing support.\nIn Q1, we also began to activate our strategic partnership with Nutrabolt, transitioning C4 energy distribution to our network. Our execution thus far has been smooth and is progressing in line with our plans. As we begin to invest behind the brand, we are securing incremental distribution points and display as well as upgrading placements. Though it is still very early days, our partnership with Nutrabolt is strong and collaborative.\nWe are excited by its potential and look forward to unlocking more value for both KDP and Nutrabolt in the quarters and years ahead. In-market execution underpins the gains we are making across our U.S. refreshment beverages portfolio. The results speak for themselves, but they are even more notable given we and the industry at large, continue to work through significant inflation.\nWe have supplemented 2022 carryover pricing with some additional pricing actions to start the year, as we protect our profitability and our ability to reinvest for the long term. The limited elasticities this business has experienced so far are a telling reminder of the resilience of the category in general and the KDP portfolio in particular.\nOur brands remain important and affordable components of our consumers' everyday lives. Still, as recessionary risks persist, we continue to closely monitor consumer health and sentiment.\nTurning now to U.S. Coffee, which represents roughly 30% of our consolidated revenue. This segment experienced a slower start to the year. The performance in pods.which as you know, is our primary focus and profit driver was as expected, with brewers softer than expected.\nPod segment's performance in the first half of the year will be difficult to analyze for longer-term trends. Let me take a step back and explain what we are seeing in the category and in our own business. Growth rates in the at-home coffee category, including the single-serve segment are being temporarily impacted by changes in mobility relative to the prior year.\nIn Q1, the category lapped the surge of the Omicron variant and lingering pandemic precautions in the year ago period are expected to continue to affect comparisons through the first half. At the same time, the category is digesting significant cumulative pricing to offset inflation. Importantly, single-serve continues to gain volume share in the at-home coffee category in the U.S. underpinning the strength and resilience of the segment and our long-term growth strategy.\nWe also see the environment for small appliances being impacted by the combination of lower consumer discretionary spending and a challenged specialty retailer environment. Sudhanshu will cover the detailed quarterly performance drivers, but let me say upfront, we expect the second half to reveal a more normalized picture of the health of the single-serve category and our ongoing momentum.\nWe are still planning to add approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig ecosystem in 2023, and we also continue to expect the back half to show strong improvement in segment operating margins.\nShort-term noise aside, the category -- the coffee category is vast and growing in the U.S. and globally. Moving out the volatility of the pandemic period, we are projecting double-digit volume growth for our at-home pods in the U.S. from 2019 to 2023, which translates to mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate. This is consistent with our previous discussions that eliminating the significant noise over the past 3 years revealed consistent and healthy long-term trends for at-home single-serve coffee.\nAs the leader in U.S. single serve, our overarching growth strategy is to continue converting consumers from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing it by the pod, which we pursue through 2 primary means. First, by driving household penetration for the Keurig system. U.S. single-serve adoption remains significantly below that in more developed single-serve markets in Western Europe and even Canada. And we expect household growth to continue for many years to come as we target adding approximately 2 million new households annually.\nSecond, by increasing revenue and profit growth from our existing 38 million U.S. Keurig households. Ongoing brewer innovation to address new and changing consumer needs, and a focus on expanding brand and variety of offerings within the Keurig ecosystem underpin our coffee growth strategy. We have news on both fronts in 2023. When it comes to meeting consumer needs, after an initial successful launch with a single customer last year, in 2023, we are expanding our K-Iced brewer platform as well as dedicated iced pods specifically designed for cold beverages.\nBoth coffee beverages are growing quickly at coffee shops and over-indexed to younger consumers. Given our ability to deliver a high-quality cold coffee experience at home for a fraction of the price, we see ice coffee as a growth opportunity for the Keurig ecosystem in 2023 and beyond.\nWe also continue to add new and exciting brands to the Keurig ecosystem. Today, we are pleased to announce that Philz Coffee, a super premium brand based in San Francisco, will be available on K-Cup pods beginning this fall. Through the new partnership with Philz as well as the additions of Intelligentsia and BLK & Bold announced last year, we are building a new super premium segment for K-Cup pods.\nOur International segment which represents just above 10% of our consolidated revenue, encompasses both our Canadian coffee and beverages business as well as our LRB businesses in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Our growth strategy for international, leverages enterprise-wide insights and capabilities to grow household penetration in coffee and to drive share gains in LRBs through brand innovation and renovation, white space expansion and strengthening our routes to market. We tailor our approach to local taste and market structures while exporting best practices and ideas across the whole of North America.\nIn Q1, we were pleased to see broad-based momentum across our brands and categories, including in mineral waters, CSDs and single-serve coffee. Our partnership with Red Bull in Mexico continues to build. And we also remained focused on expanding within the low or no alcohol category, including through our acquisition of Atypique in Canada. Both opportunities leverage our existing portfolio and distribution assets, including our DSD system in Mexico and our alcohol portfolio and expertise in Canada.\nWrapping up, we expect the operating environment to remain fluid, and we see KDP as well positioned to continue to deliver strong consolidated performance in 2023. We are reaffirming our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. On an underlying basis, this implies adjusted EPS growth that is closer to 9% at the top end of our long-term algorithm.\nIn addition, KDP has a track record of strong free cash flow generation, and we expect to continue to unlock the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation. We have evolved our capital allocation approach to better fit our development stage as a company and to respond to a higher interest rate environment.\nWe are prioritizing internal investments, partnerships and M&A, balanced against returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, which we undertook this quarter and last quarter. A recent upgrade by Moody's to a stronger investment-grade credit rating recognizes that the inherent portfolio balance of our modern beverage company, along with our capital allocation philosophy and free cash flow profile, all aspects that Sudhanshu will talk more about next.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Vista Outdoor Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. In kicking off 2023, we made the decision to realign our segment reporting to more closely reflect how we plan, run and evaluate these businesses internally. The new U.S. coffee segment will also enhance comparability relative to how we speak about our long-term goals, including our 2 million annual U.S. household penetration target. There is also the added benefit of giving you a more refined picture of our operations in the United States, which is by far our largest market.\nWe believe the size, scale and margin profile of each U.S. segment becomes more visible externally, making it easier for you to track and analyze. U.S. refreshment beverages is an $8 billion-plus revenue business with a 28% adjusted operating margin. The U.S. coffee business is $4.3 billion in revenue, also very large with an adjusted operating margin above 32%.\nObviously, both are high-quality CPG businesses with tremendous scale in the U.S. market. At the same time, our fast-growing international segment at approximately $1.7 billion of revenue and a 24% adjusted operating margin is already meaningful and quite profitable.\nWe are pleased that KDP's portfolio delivered over all Q1 results, which were consistent with our going-in expectations even as performance among the segments was varied. Q1 sales advanced 9% driven by a strong in-market execution, particularly in U.S. refreshment beverages. Gross profit dollars grew at a similar rate, and we increased marketing investments versus prior year. At $0.34, our adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% versus Q1 last year. Without a $0.05 headwind from the significant reduction in nonoperational items year-over-year, underlying EPS growth in the quarter was in the high-teens.\nAs discussed on our last earnings call, we are committed to a step function decrease in the use of nonoperational items this year. And as this occurs, the earning powers of the business will become even more visible. Our actions also continued to reflect our revised capital allocation priorities.\nIn Q1, we saw and took advantage of a value opportunity in KDP shares and bought back 6.6 million shares during the quarter. Combined with the share repurchases we undertook in late 2022, we have now returned more than $500 million to shareholders via opportunistic buybacks over the past 2 quarters.\nOur high-quality portfolio, consistent results, well-capitalized balance sheet and flexible capital allocation approach are being increasingly recognized. As Bob mentioned, Moody's upgraded our credit rating earlier this month, which is especially notable in a weaker macro environment. We believe our strong balance sheet and North American focus represents a safe haven in the current tumultuous financial market.\nLet's now take a closer look at consolidated Q1 results. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, our top line growth was driven by pricing taken to offset inflation and a modest volume/mix decline. Net sales grew 8.9% to $3.4 billion with pricing up approximately 10%.\nGross margins were stable at 52.7% and primarily reflected the combined benefits of pricing, productivity gains and positive mix balanced against considerable input cost inflation. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by about 100 bps versus prior year, reflecting continued elevated transportation, warehousing and labor costs.\nDespite these cost headwinds, we increased marketing investment to support our brand momentum. We also lapped an SG&A benefit of $28 million from a stock comp accounting chain in the prior year period. Q1 adjusted operating income was $699 million, about 4.5% below a year ago, but representing almost 9% growth on an underlying basis.\nAdjusted net income grew about 1%, aided by flat interest expense, equity method earnings and a lower tax rate versus the prior year. Lower diluted shares outstanding helped drive additional leverage in the EPS growth rate.\nTurning now to segment performance. U.S. refreshment beverages sales grew 12.7%, led by 12.5 percentage points from favorable net price realization. The benefit of pricing was sequentially lower relative to Q4 as we begin to anniversary price increases we took in early 2022 and have not yet captured the full benefit of pricing actions announced earlier this year.\nVolume mix was slightly positive in the quarter reflecting very limited elasticity impact as well as the contribution from C4 Energy. This volume mix result speaks to resilient consumer demand, modest elasticities in our categories and a successful slate of renovations and innovations.\nSegment operating income increased 11.6% as we effectively translated top line momentum to bottom line results despite inflation in packaging, manufacturing and labor costs. Our U.S. coffee segment represents a single-serve ecosystem in which our brewers create a platform for high-quality coffee experiences through our high-margin consumable K-Cup pods. Simply put, we are in the business of selling pods, not brewers.\nThat said, we recognize that the quarter volatility in brewers can sometimes distort the picture. To help you further contextualize brewer trends, we are introducing 2 additional disclosures, trailing 12 months brewers sold and associated growth rates.\nYou saw both of these in our press release this morning. Going forward, while we will continue to disclose quarterly brewer sales and shipments in our 10-Q, we will focus our remarks in this forum as well as in the press release on trailing 12 months strength, which we believe to smooth the inherent quarterly volatility of appliances relative to consumables.\nLet's now get into the results. In U.S. Coffee, Q1 revenue declined 1.3%, with pricing up 5.3%, but volume mix down 6.6%. The involvement for small appliances was more dynamic than we expected, reflecting the combination of softer discretionary spending and a challenged specialty retailer landscape. These factors primarily impacted brewer shipments, which declined 29% in the quarter. For perspective, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter of the year, accounting for less than 20% of brewer shipments.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, brewer shipments totaled $10.2 million, reflecting a 9.8% decline year-over-year, but a strong growth of 25.6% relative to the pre-pandemic period ending Q1 2019. Our goal of adding an incremental 2 million households in the U.S. in 2023 remains intact.\nU.S. pod revenues grew 2.9% and pod volumes declined modestly, down 1.9% in quarter 1. This was influenced by consumer mobility that was meaningfully different versus the same time last year when the Omicron surge led to more time spent at home. There are other factors at play in the category such as some elasticity in response to pricing and mix shifts to a more normalized level of premium versus private label exposure.\nHowever, we continue to believe that mobility is the largest driver of at-home coffee category softness over the past few quarters. It follows that pod trends should improve in H2 as mobility differences relative to last year begin to dissipate.\nWe continue to expect U.S. coffee volumes in quarter 2 to remain under pressure against the year ago period when we successfully executed our coffee recovery program and rebuilt partner and retail inventories after supply disruptions.\nInflation remains a headwind in U.S. Coffee, where segment operating margin contracted 130 basis points in the quarter and segment operating income declined 5.3%. We expect an improvement in the relationship between inflation, pricing and productivity in the back half which provides good visibility to a strong margin recovery in the segment, leading to a year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023.\nIn particular, we are refocusing on productivity in 2023 after much of 2022 was focused on prioritizing customer service. I want to revert for a minute to Q1 performance as it would have been reported for the former Coffee Systems segment.\nConstant currency revenue for Coffee Systems grew 1% in quarter 1 with faster growth in Canada relative to the U.S. Following the segment realignment and reflecting softer-than-expected brewer volume, we now expect U.S. Coffee revenue to grow approximately 1% in 2023 with segment operating income growth of 3% to 4%.\nThis incorporates plans for ongoing marketing reinvestment and the expected back half margin expansion. Our consolidated outlook for KDP in 2023, which I will address in more detail shortly, remains unchanged.\nOur International segment performance in Q1 was strong and well balanced. Net sales increased 16.7% with net price realization contributing 9 points of growth and volume mix up 7.7% year-over-year. Growth was broad-based and led by LRBs and single sub-pods.\nThe combination of net price realization and productivity gains helped to offset inflationary headwinds and together led to a strong segment operating income growth of 18%.\nTurning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million. This declined relative to last year, reflecting the lapping of certain discrete benefits in Q1 2022, such as the BODYARMOR litigation settlement gain as well as a use of net working capital this quarter.\nFor the full year, we expect the rate of free cash flow conversion to approach our long-term target. This brings us to our consolidated outlook. With Q1 results largely as expected, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to increase 5% in 2023 and adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%.\nWe continue to project currency translation to be a 50 basis point headwind to both top and bottom lines. As Bob said, underlying EPS growth is expected to be closer to 9% at the top end of our high single-digit long-term algorithm. This basis removes the noise from year-over-year differences in nonoperational items, which we still expect to roughly half relative to 2022 levels.\nDespite the recent news headlines about CPI and PPI easing, we continue to see significant cost inflation. Headwinds across realized raw material costs transportation and labor are sticky and persistent, and we still expect mid-single-digit inflation in 2023. We are highly focused on offsetting these pressures through a combination of pricing, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives, and we expect the gap versus inflation to reverse as the year progresses.\nOur full year guidance for below-the-line items remains unchanged. We expect interest expense in a $465 million to $470 million range, which still includes $45 million related to the Nutrabolt investment. Equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million, an effective tax rate of 22% for the year and approximately 1.42 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nAs it relates to quarter 2, EPS is expected to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range. We still expect to have a gap between inflation and pricing and productivity in the quarter with a more beneficial relationship expected to materialize in the back half.\nMarketing is also expected to increase in quarter 2, reflecting incremental investments across both LRBs and coffee particularly behind the Iced platform in U.S. Coffee that Bob highlighted earlier.\nTo wrap up, our overall Q1 performance tracked largely in line with our expectations, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the balance of 2023, which promises to remain dynamic. Our recast segments better eliminate the scale of our businesses with distinct and clearly defined growth pillars in place for each segment.\nOur brand portfolio, renovation and innovation activity and in-market execution remains very strong. We are working diligently to offset inflation and to drive margin improvement later in the year while reinvesting in our brands.\nAnd finally, our capital allocation priorities are clear as we look to deploy our strong cash flow against the highest ROI opportunities.\nI will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Sudhanshu. Before moving to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank Maria who is retiring in July after a distinguished 40-plus-year career. She will remain with KDP as an adviser through year-end. I know that most of you hold Maria in the highest regard, just as we do at KDP where she has been a valued member of the executive leadership team for the last 5 years.\nMaria and I have worked together for over a decade, spanning 2 companies and countless deals, including an IPO. She has built a very strong corporate affairs team for KDP, and we are pleased that she will stay on as an adviser to support the transition to her successor upon hire.\nWe will all miss working with Maria, and wish her the very best in this next and well-earned chapter. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2022. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. Ms. Sceppaguercio, please go ahead.\n\nMaria A. Sceppaguercio-Gever\n\nChief Corporate Affairs Officer, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the fourth quarter. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends.\nWhile the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates, but not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-K which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.\nToday, we will also speak to the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of previously disclosed nonoperational items. In '22, these items included gains on asset sale leaseback, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to BodyArmor, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation.\nHere with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; and our Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. Also with us this morning is the IR team, including Jane Gelfand, who we are excited to welcome this week as our new Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives.\nI'm confident that many of you know Jane from her time on the street as well as her most recent role at Wayfair, where she led a number of finance functions, including Investor Relations and Treasury. Jane is replacing Steve Alexander, who after more than 16 successful years in finance, commercial and IR with KDP and predecessor companies has decided to take some time off for family and travel. We are pleased that Steve has agreed to stay on through April to support the transition.\nAnd finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nCEO & Chairman, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. In 2022, we continue to advance our vision of a modern beverage company by expanding our portfolio to reach more beverage consumers' needs and occasions and by enhancing our unique selling and route-to-market capabilities to make our brands available at every point of sale.\nOur full year financial results were in line with or above our guidance with revenue growing by 11% and adjusted diluted EPS expanding by 5%. Since our Q3 earnings call, we had the opportunity to engage with many of you twice. First, at our early December in-person event, where you met the KDP management team and Board of Directors. And again, on our mid-December fireside chat, during which we discussed our investment in Nutrabolt, including the distribution agreement for C4 and answer questions regarding recent trends in the categories in which we compete.\nThose conversations provided us with a good sense of what's top of mind with our investors, which we will build upon during today's call. I'll start by providing perspective on the macro and category environments we faced in 2022, discuss how we created shareholder value over the past year and offer thoughts on how we see 2023 shaping up both in terms of the macro environment and our strategy to continue winning.\nSudhanshu will follow me with specifics on our Q4 and full year 2022 results, provide more detailed guidance on key metrics for 2023 and discuss the evolution of our capital allocation policy. While it seems like a long time ago, we started 2022 with the lingering effects of supply chain disruption primarily driven by a final COVID wave that reduced labor availability in late 2021 and early 2022.\nWe felt that impact most acutely in our coffee business, where strong 2021 consumer demand had depleted our inventories and in our still beverage portfolio where we faced a range of supply shortages. We implemented supply recovery programs that yielded strong customer service improvements with replenished inventory levels.\nBy Q2, our concerns around COVID and supply chain disruptions were quickly supplanted by industry inflation in ingredients and materials, labor and transportation that was outpacing significant pricing. Elasticities held up well in the categories in which we compete, which enables strong revenue growth, driven by both the higher pricing and increased volume, but came at lower margins.\nFor perspective, we faced total cost inflation in 2022 of 16%, far above our expectations going into the year. And we implemented pricing actions across our portfolio that averaged in the low double digits. Pricing realization was strong and accelerated throughout the year. Yet it consistently lagged the timing of the escalating inflationary impact on our P&L.\nAs we approach the end of the year and enter 2023, we became more focused on the potential impact of recession on our consumers despite seeing minimal evidence of changing behavior to date, we are monitoring consumer behavior closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure our brand strength continues into 2023 and beyond. Of course, the wide range of challenges of 2022 is a continuation of the rolling set of obstacles we have navigated since the onset of COVID in 2020.\nIn this context, we have discussed the benefits of our all-weather business model. This is more than a punchy soundbite. It reflects our ability to manage our broad portfolio and unique (inaudible) market to deliver strong and consistent shareholder returns in an unpredictable and changing environment as we did in 2022 and every year since forming KDP in 2018.\nIn addition to delivering our ambitious financial commitments over the past 5 years, we've also been immersed in an integration and transformation process that created a modern beverage company that today can consistently deliver attractive, high-quality, dependable returns with a well-capitalized balance sheet. Towards that end, we have evolved our capital allocation policy to reflect that of a more mature KDP and to be contemporary with a changing macro environment marked by rising interest rates.\nDuring the integration and transformation stage, we had a strong focus on rapid deleveraging, using all available levers available to us while still investing in building our capabilities and brands. We took advantage of compelling opportunities to monetize nonstrategic assets through sale-leaseback transactions, which enabled us to simultaneously invest, delever and drive strong returns for our shareholders.\nAs we shift from integration and transformation to activation, we are planning for a step change reduction in the use of nonoperational benefits starting this year. That means our underlying operational growth will exceed our adjusted growth in 2023. Of course, our guidance will continue to be for adjusted metrics and we will report results on the same basis we've always done, but we will also highlight operational performance from time to time to provide you with a better sense of the underlying strength of our business.\nStrong cash flow remains a hallmark of KDP. As we discussed in December, we plan to deploy our cash to improve our long-term targeted leverage ratio to 2.5x or below, while still funding strategic growth projects and attractive return of cash to shareholders. With the learnings from 2022 in mind, I'll shift to a discussion of our 2023 outlook, starting with the most pressing industry topic from last year, inflation.\nOur plan assumes the rate of inflation will moderate to the mid-single-digit range. That translates to a cumulative increase in rate of approximately 30% over the past 3 years, clearly unprecedented in our lifetimes. Regarding the inflation outlook for 2023, recent spot price declines of key inputs might lead some to believe there could be industry deflation.\nThe reality is we don't buy on a spot basis, and the underlying commodity cost doesn't reflect the total delivered cost to us. Such is certainly the case in coffee, where seat prices dropped in late 2022. However, the differential which includes everything in our fully landed coffee costs such as broker fees, sea freight and premium coffee upcharges was up meaningfully.\nLabor is another area in which we're continuing to see persistent inflation. To offset the continued impact of inflation, we have upped our game in productivity, reduced our discretionary costs and increased pricing. The realization of 2022 pricing actions will continue to flow into our P&L during 2023 and in some areas where continued inflationary impacts are not yet fully covered by pricing.\nWe have implemented additional revenue growth management actions to address key margin gaps. The combination of moderating inflation and continued pricing realization means that we expect year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023, but not yet returning to 2019 levels. With higher gross margins in view for 2023, the conversation shifts to demand.\nA key focus point for us in 2023 is the financial health of American consumers and its impact on price elasticities for the categories in which we compete. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to expect that lower but still positive year-over-year pricing realization, combined with modest elasticity will yield KDP net revenue growth of approximately 5% in 2023.\nIt's also important to be proactive in ensuring the continued strength of our brands by increasing our investment in growth in 2023. As we are all aware, industry marketing budgets were reduced during COVID and many haven't yet been fully restored. While we have learned to be significantly more efficient with our brand spending, 2023 is the right time to increase our absolute investment behind key segments and brands as well as to support a strong lineup of innovation.\nThe improvement in our gross margin combined with 5% revenue growth, will enable us to deliver year-over-year improvement in operating income growth, even with our increased brand investments and the headwind of comping significant nonoperational benefits in 2022. Taking all of the macro and company-specific factors discussed this morning into account, we expect adjusted EPS for 2023 to grow by 6% to 7%.\nRemoving the impact of previously disclosed nonoperational items from 2022 implies adjusted EPS growth that is toward the high end of our long-term algorithm. Our expectation for continued strong value creation in 2023 is rooted in the success of our unique and flexible business strategy over the past 5 years.\nIn cold beverage, our focus is on driving growth. First, in core brands through marketing, brand renovation and continued strong in-market execution. In 2022, we continued to build upon or hold the significant share gains we achieved over the past few years in total liquid refreshment beverages in key segments such as CSDs and premium water.\nSecond, by filling white space in our portfolio through innovation and partnerships, such as our strategic relationship with Nutrabolt for C4 Energy and our Red Bull agreement in Mexico, as well as our expansion into new platforms such as nonalcohol beer with our investment in athletic drilling and better-for-you drinks in food service through our partnership with Tractor Beverage.\nThird, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including e-commerce, where we are one of the food and beverage leaders in our company-owned direct store distribution system. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger direct route-to-market capability through investment in capabilities and tools and acquiring key DSD distributor territories. All of which have driven consistently strong market share performance across our brands and segments.\nIn Coffee Systems, we are focused on growth. First, by driving household penetration growth for the Keurig system every year. Given the large number of remaining addressable households, we have line of sight to continued household growth well into the future. As we enter 2023, we have built a U.S. installed base of 38 million households, which along with our installed base in Canada consume more than 13 billion cups of coffee manufactured by KDP annually.\nSecond, by expanding the roster of coffee partners in the Keurig system. 2022, we welcomed back Community Coffee and added new brands such as Black & Gold, the first Black owned nationally distributed coffee brand; and Intelligentsia, one of specialty coffees most pioneering and innovative brands. Third, by creating new platforms to drive incremental revenue and profit growth from existing Keurig households, such as connected brewers and new beverage formats and occasions.\nIn 2022, we expanded our lineup of connected brewers with the introduction of K-Cafe SMART, which has received outstanding consumer and professional reviews, expanded the Keurig app which works with both connected and nonconnected brewers to help consumers make barista-quality specialty coffee beverages at home and expanded availability of our Keurig Slim + ICED brewer and expanded our Brew Over Ice pods.\nIn 2023 Ice will be a significant focus area for Keurig with expanded K-ICED machines and pods supported by dedicated marketing and focused retailer support. And finally, KDP's extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation, including M&A and partnerships, opportunistic share repurchases and growing our dividend within our stated payout ratio of 45% of free cash flow.\nWith that as important context, I'll hand it over to Sudhanshu to discuss 2022 results and our 2023 outlook in more depth.\n\nSudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi\n\nCFO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I joined the company 3 months ago because I believed KDP represented a unique investment and value creation opportunity, and my conviction has grown significantly as I have started to understand the business better. This conviction will be reflected in my perspective on our 2022 results, the important learnings as we look back on the year and the implications for 2023.\nStarting with Coffee Systems. Before jumping into specific numbers, I'd like to share my perspective on the coffee category. Coffee is an attractive long-term growth category. KDP operates primarily in the At Home coffee segment in the U.S. and Canada, where we are the industry leader. The At Home segment comprises the vast majority of all coffee drinking occasions and single-serve is the clear winner, consistently growing share of At Home occasions.\nThere has been significant noise between 2019 and 2022 in both the At Home and Away-From-Home coffee categories, primarily due to shifting consumer mobility and we acknowledge that it has been a challenge for investors to separate the signal from that noise. After significant At Home coffee volume growth in 2020 and 2021, due to increased consumer time spent at home, we began to see a deceleration in 2022. This occurred globally in all parts of At Home coffee, which is quite unprecedented.\nThere are several factors at play causing this concurrent decline. We believe the primary contributors are a reduction in time spent at home for consumers which we know correlates with coffee consumption as well as some elasticity impact of significant pricing actions taken in 2022. Specific to the U.S., consistent with the global trends, volume for the total At Home coffee category decreased 6% in IRI with all major firms declining, including bag, can and single-serve.\nHowever, single-serve coffee outperformed, enabling it to gain share of total At Home coffee consumption. KDP's owned and licensed brands demonstrated relative strength in 2022 despite having among the highest price increases in the single subsegment with the fourth quarter representing its highest share position since before COVID, driving the strength by the strong innovation that has resonated with consumers and reinstated promotions in the second half as part supply was restored.\nWe saw a similar trend at play in coffee brewers in the U.S. where small appliance volumes were challenged in 2022, comping against growth in 2020 and 2021, that was primarily fueled by time at home as well as in part by stimulus checks. Although not immune from this dynamic, Keurig compatible brewers also gain share of all coffee makers in 2022.\nMoving to the financials. For the year, the segment grew net sales 6.2% with pricing up 7% and volume mix down 0.8%. Pod revenue also advanced 6.2%, reflecting the benefit of pricing and a 1.4% increase in volume. Brewer volume declined 5.2% in 2022, comping the double-digit growth we have experienced each year since the onset of COVID. As you know, our goal is not brewer sales, but rather household penetration, and we added more than 2 million new households to the Keurig system in 2022, modestly above our long-term annual target.\nInnovation is a key driver of household penetration, and we are pleased with the performance of our 2022 brewery innovation slate and excited about what's coming in 2023. While top line growth in Coffee Systems was solid, the challenge in 2022 was operating income, which declined 7.5% as inflation exceeded net realized pricing compressing margins.\nWe expect an improvement in the relationship between inflation and pricing going forward, leading to a year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023. Specifically, our 2023 outlook projects KDP coffee systems to deliver 3% to 4% net sales growth and 5% to 7% operating income growth. Removing the impact of nonoperational items in 2022, this implies higher Coffee Systems operating income growth in 2023.\nWe expect a strong recovery in margins reflecting the strength of KDP's owned and licensed brands and a favorable relationship between pricing and inflation, particularly in the second half of the year, which will be significantly stronger than the first half. While the Keurig system is unique, it's scale of $5 billion in net sales and OI margins above 30% are consistent with our best-in-class CPG business. While we continue to manage the business to drive household growth and extract incremental value from our existing installed base, I think it makes sense to assess coffee systems using the same conventional metrics as you would any other CPG business. That translates into net sales and operating income performance, the outlook for which we are sharing with you today for the year ahead.\nOur 2023 outlook reflects the following factors that we believe are most relevant to consider. First, while mobility has recovered significantly from 2020 lows, it still remains below pre-COVID levels, and we expect its continued recovery in 2023 to represent a headwind for at-home coffee consumption, especially in the first half. Second, the industry's pricing actions taken in 2022 will have a carryover benefit in the first half of 2023, which will have a modest negative impact on volumes.\nAs discussed, total at-home coffee volumes declined during 2022 and these category trends have continued in early 2023, although single-serve importantly continues to outperform. Third, we see a rapidly evolving retail environment for small appliances with challenges in key mass and department and assistive retailers impacting the availability of our brewers.\nWe are targeting alternative channels such as e-commerce to pick up the slack. However, we believe it's reasonable to expect a modest decline in Keurig brewer shipments year-over-year in 2023. These factors, which will have an influence of 2023 results in no way alter our bullish long-term outlook for the coffee category or our expected outperformance for the single-serve format.\nTurning now to our core beverage business, which performed very well in 2022 and enters 2023 with strong momentum. Beverage Concentrate had an exceptional year in 2022. Net sales grew 16.4% with net pricing up 14.7% and volume mix up 1.7%. Dr Pepper brand drove the performance largely reflecting the expansion of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar and a strong in-market support. Dr Pepper Zero Sugar detailed dollars in volumes each grew in the strong double digits during 2022, outpacing the Zero Sugar segment, reflecting net price realization, strong velocity growth and incremental distribution gains.\nBeverage Concentrates adjusted operating income grew 16.9%. This reflected the favorable relationship between pricing and inflation as the shared benefit of bottler pricing actions was only minimally offset by inflation given the margin structure of the business.\nDuring the year, we also benefited from the opening of our Newbridge Ireland concentrate facility, which represented a dual source of concentrate manufacturing for KDP. The new facility had a smooth and successful start-up in 2022.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we continue to be excited about the beverage concentrates business, particularly given our strong innovation offerings, including the first quarter launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream. We expect the segment to post operating income growth in 2023 that moderate versus a strong 17% growth achieved in 2022. This reflects our expectation for a reduced benefit of pricing in response to the expected lower level of year-over-year inflation.\nContinuing with packaged beverages. For the year, we grew net sales 12.4%, with pricing up a strong 12.1% and volume mix up 0.3%. Elasticities for the business remain modest due to the strength of our brand portfolio. This strength is most evident in our in-market performance where we gained share in categories representing 92% of our U.S. retail sales base, leading to expansion of our total LRB share.\nWe are pleased with our strong ongoing in-market execution, which has enabled us to maintain the cumulative share gains achieved in CSDs since 2019 and continue to strengthen our #2 share position in premium water driven by significant growth of CORE hydration, Polar and Vita Coco. Our partnership with Polar is a great example of our win-win partnership approach as Polar is now the #2 national sparkling water brand in the grocery channel and is gaining ground in all other channels.\nIn the juice category, Mott's continued to be a standout driving double-digit growth in both pricing and volume for the year and gaining an impressive 3.6 share points in a category in which its primary competitor is private label. Adjusted operating income for packaged beverages grew 1.2% in 2022. And had our strong net sales growth and productivity were largely offset by inflation as well as a negative year-over-year nonoperational competition.\nSimilar to Coffee Systems, adjusted operating margin for packaged beverages compressed for the year due to the timing disconnect between inflation and pricing despite our ability to realize more pricing in core beverages than in coffee systems. Importantly, packaged beverages exited the year with strong underlying momentum.\nTurning to 2023. We expect a strong net sales growth for packaged beverages that moderate versus the 12% growth in 2022 as the impact from carryover and select new pricing actions is expected to be less significant than the pricing benefit realized in 2022. Net sales will also benefit from our recently announced distribution partnership for C4 energy drinks. The integration is well underway and tracking our plans.\nPackaged Beverages has a strong innovation lineup planned for the year beginning with an active first quarter. In CSDs, the highlight will be the Q1 launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream which has garnered a strong consumer response, achieving a 1% share of CSD in the very early stages of the launch. In addition, we just launched CORE Hydration, a nutrient enhanced water that offers distinct functional benefits and we are launching a new variety for our highly incremental Snapple elements line in March.\nWe plan to increase marketing investments to support the core business and this new innovation. Packaged Beverages operating income is expected to be strong in 2023 with margin expanding due to a better relationship between pricing and inflation and we expect the segment's underlying performance to be even stronger, driven by gross margin expansion, partially offset by marketing investments.\nEnding with Latin America beverages, Latin America Beverages had another outstanding year, delivering a strong and balanced net sales growth of 23% with both net pricing and volume mix up significantly. Our performance was led by Penafiel, which delivered a strong double-digit sales growth and continued to gain share. Clamato was also a standout with double-digit sales growth and a significant increase in market share.\nAdjusted operating income for the segment grew 18.5% in 2022, reflecting the strong top line growth and productivity that more than offset inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. In 2023, we expect continued momentum in Latin America Beverages, reflecting the strong commercial plans to drive incremental distribution, continued a strong in-market performance and our distribution partnership with Red Bull Mexico.\nTurning briefly to the consolidated results for the fourth quarter which are addressed in detail in our press release. Consolidated net sales grew more than 12%, reflecting higher net pricing and a modest volume/mix decline. Growth was balanced across our portfolio, with all 4 segments expanding net sales at a double-digit rate in the quarter.\nAdjusted gross profit advanced almost 11% and gross margin contracted 80 basis points, but improved sequentially on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating income grew 13.2% and adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS in the quarter grew 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 to $0.50.\nTurning to our 2022 full year results. Total company net sales grew 11% with growth in both net price and volume mix, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Adjusted gross profit grew almost 8% and gross margin contracted 170 basis points due to the timing of pricing and productivity lagging double-digit inflation.\nAdjusted operating income grew 4%, reflecting a double-digit growth in net sales and a year-over-year benefit from company's strategic asset investment program largely offset by the contraction in gross margin and significant inflation in transportation and warehousing costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 5% to $1.68 for the year, consistent with the guidance.\nTurning now to our balance sheet, cash flow generation and evolved capital allocation policy. Free cash flow conversion was exceptionally in 2022 at 111%, well ahead of our long-term target of approximately 100%. Operating cash flow totaled $2.8 billion for the year and free cash flow grew to $2.7 billion.\nOur strong cash flow generation is a powerful value creation tool. As Bob discussed, we evolved our capital allocation policy to reflect changes in the macro environment. With the interest rate increases over the past year, our hurdle rate for deploying cash has increased, and it is appealing to maintain strong liquidity and ample dry powder. As discussed during our December fireside chat, we believe it makes sense to continue to reduce our leverage over time and had established a long-term management leverage target of 2x to 2.5x, which compared to 2.8x at the end of 2022.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, in addition to internal organic growth investments, our top priority is value-enhancing M&A and strategic partnerships, along with opportunistic share repurchases to return value to shareholders and manage share creep as well as growing our dividend within our 45% stated payout ratio target. Our focus in 2023 will be the integration and expansion of our 2022 partnerships and investments, so we currently do not expect M&A to represent a significant use of cash in the near term.\nOur capital allocation (inaudible) 2022 already began to demonstrate our updated priorities. During the course of the year, we invested almost $1 billion in attractive new growth platforms, namely our 30% equity stake in Nutrabolt, the acquisition of (inaudible) and equity investments in Athletic Brewing and Tractor beverages. We also continued to strengthen our DSD network with a number of territory deals to further increase our scale and effectiveness.\nAt the same time, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 6.7% in September, and the opportunistic repurchase of 10.6 million shares.\nI will close with our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 constant currency net sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. The latter representing a year-over-year growth improvement versus 2022. Foreign currency translation is expected to approximate 0.5 point headwind to both net sales and adjusted EPS growth.\nRemoving the impact of nonoperational items, this implies significantly higher adjusted EPS growth. Included in our guidance are the following assumptions: interest expense in the range of $465 million to $470 million, reflecting the rising interest rate environment and including approximately $45 million related to financing the Nutrabolt transaction.\nRegarding Nutrabolt, we expect some net sales benefit from our distribution agreement for C4, as previously discussed, 2023 is expected to be a transition and investment year for the partnership, and therefore, we are not expecting any material impact on earnings this year. However, we do expect equity method income from our 30% stake in Nutrabolt to approximate $40 million to $45 million, which offsets the neutral related interest expense. This equity method income will flow through nonoperating other expense and income.\nThe effective tax rate is estimated at approximately 22%. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 1.42 billion. From a timing standpoint, we expect EPS for the first quarter to be roughly even with a year ago, reflecting our belief that Q1 will have the highest rate of inflation, the largest marketing increase and the smallest productivity benefit of the year.\nQ1 will also be comping significant nonoperational benefits in the year ago period. We expect EPS growth to strengthen in the balance of the year as inflation moderates and productivity benefits ramp. I will now turn it over to Bob for closing comments.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nCEO & Chairman, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nWe formed KDP in 2018 as a pure-play beverage company focused on the North American market. In the U.S. alone, there are 1.2 trillion beverage consumption occasions in play every year. Beyond population growth, that number doesn't change much, nor do the fundamental consumer needs for beverages. What has and will continue to change is which beverage formats consumers choose to satisfy their needs and where consumers purchase their beverages.\nCompared to 2017, we served an additional 6 billion beverage occasions in 2022 through portfolio innovation, renovation and new partnerships. By executing our concept of a modern beverage company, which reflects our holistic view of all beverage opportunities, we've been able to better satisfy consumer needs, leading to our accelerated growth rate.\nWe remain excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. In 2023 and beyond, we'll continue to leverage our business model to capture even more of the trillion-plus beverage occasions each year in North America. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's earnings call for the third quarter of 2022. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\n\nSteve Alexander\n\nSenior Director of IR, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the third quarter of 2022. If you need a copy, you can get 1 on our website in the Investors' section. Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability and presents growth rates on a constant currency basis. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance.\nDetails of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP CEO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Interim CFO, George Lagoudakis. Also joining us for Q&A are KDP Executive Chairman, Bob Gamgort; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio.\nAnd finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ozan.\n\nOzan Dokmecioglu\n\nCEO & Director, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Given that this is my first earnings call as CEO, I would like to start today's discussion with my thoughts on the KDP operating model and a strategic approach that makes us unique in the CPG space. Our focus continues to be on managing our business for a range of potential macro outcomes and leveraging the all-weather business model we have created to drive success, regardless of the environment we may face.\nOur results this quarter and the consistency of our performance since merger are a testament to the strength of this model, which has continued to perform well in the highly volatile macro environment our industry has faced since the onset of COVID. And most recently, our portfolio has performed well with significant levels of inflation and pricing along with a challenged consumer landscape, demonstrating its recession resistance with elasticity impacts remaining modest and our market share positions remaining strong.\nOur business model starts with an attractive and competitive organic total shareholder return algorithm, which is driven by a flexible and scalable strategy. In cold beverages, our strategy is focused on driving growth in core brands through marketing, brand renovation and in-market execution. By filling white space in our portfolio through innovation and partnerships, such as our Polar Seltzers' partnership and the recently announced Red Bull selling and distribution agreement in Mexico, which we will touch on a bit later and by enhancing the breadth, depth and effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system, including our company-owned direct store distribution system.\nThe investments we have made in selling and distribution over the past several years have built a stronger go-to-market capability that has driven consistently strong market share performance across all the brands and beverage segments. In Coffee Systems, we are focused on driving household penetration growth for the Keurig system at the rate of approximately 2 million new households every year. Given the number of remaining addressable new households for the Keurig system, which we estimate at more than 50 million, we have line of sight to household growth well beyond the next 10 years.\nWe are also focused on increasing revenue and profit growth from our existing 36 million Keurig households through new platforms such as connected brewers and the new beverage formats and occasions. In addition to our core algorithm, KDP's extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation. We believe that M&A is the most attractive and value-accretive option for the deployment of our capital, given our disciplined approach and proven ability to create value for KDP and our shareholders.\nWe also see opportunistic share buybacks and investment in our internal growth projects as attractive uses of our capital. We view our North America geographic focus as a distinct advantage, particularly in the current macro environment as we can execute our organic and inorganic growth strategies in what is arguably one of the world's most stable and predictable operating environments. In addition, while most companies, including KDP, report profit and loss, growth rates on a constant currency basis and a strong U.S. dollar reduces cash flow and profits when foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. This impact is minimal for KDP.\nThe third quarter results we reported today provide a great example of our strategy and operating model at work, delivering for shareholders. Specifically, net sales advanced 12%. Adjusted operating income increased 2%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4.5%. Our cash flow was again strong in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to almost $2 billion, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of 114%. This performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our brands and in-market execution in an environment with broad-based inflation and reduced consumer purchasing power as our elasticities continue to be modest.\nThese consolidated results were in line with our guidance, with outperformance in our cold beverage segments offsetting some pressures in coffee. With just 1 quarter left in the year, we continue to expect consolidated results to be on track with our guidance as cold beverages is expected to continue performing well and coffee strengthens considerably, as it moves past supply chain issues earlier in the year and a significant green coffee pressure experienced in the third quarter. This is what we mean by the benefits our all-weather business model provides, reinforcing the advantages of our uniquely diversified beverage portfolio.\nWe continue to expect the fourth quarter to represent a step change in total KDP performance as we anniversary the spike in inflation across the business in the fourth quarter of last year and our coffee business performance accelerates. As has been the case throughout 2022, broad-based inflation continued to impact margins in quarter 3 as the significant pricing actions we have taken to date have not yet fully caught up to inflation. We experienced total cost inflation in quarter 1 of 15%, which escalated further to more than 17% in quarter 2. And in quarter 3, it remained at the 17% level.\nIn the fourth quarter, we will begin comping the significant inflation spike in the year ago period, which reduces the rate of inflation on this year's profit and loss. As a result, we expect the contribution from previously taken pricing actions to catch up to inflation in the quarter, which will enable us to deliver margins above last year.\nOur cold beverages business continues to perform exceptionally well and posted significant sequential improvement in margins. Our packaged beverages and beverage concentrate segments combined grew both net sales and operating income by 14% in the quarter, maintaining a combined operating margin even with a year ago. In coffee, net sales advanced 5%, led by pricing that was partially offset by lower volume mix, while the impact of broad-based inflation, including the highest year-over-year green coffee costs, weighed on operating income. Pricing continued to advance but has not yet fully caught up to inflation.\nThe good news is peak green coffee installation is largely behind us, causing the impact of inflation on the coffee profit and loss to moderate significantly as we lap the inflation spike in quarter 4 last year. Along with these improving trends heading into the fourth quarter, our coffee segment top line is expected to strengthen as the benefit of pricing and brand investments builds and the supply issues we have encountered in the first half are truly behind us. Taken together, we continue to expect meaningful, sequential improvement in coffee segment net sales and operating income growth in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to in-market performance. Let me provide some perspective on what we are seeing in terms of trends in our categories, including pricing, elasticities and consumer mobility. Starting with the cold beverages. In liquid refreshment beverages, the category continued to perform well with dollar consumption in the quarter and year-to-date periods up 10% and volume down less than 2%. Elasticity in the category continues to be modest, even as pricing was up in the low double digits for both periods, and consumer mobility continued to increase.\nKDP's LRB dollar consumption increased more than 11% in the quarter, growing LRB share in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, reflecting the benefit of pricing that was only modestly offset by volume, which remained quite resilient with elasticities below the category in both periods. We continue to benefit from healthy categories, a strong portfolio of leading brands and very effective in-market execution. The strong performance in the quarter was broad-based and led by share gains in premium waters and seltzers, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks.\nIn carbonated soft drinks, our performance also continued to be strong with dollar consumption up 12% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, with our share up year-to-date. We are pleased that we continue to expand on the impressive share gains we generated over the past couple of years. Within carbonated soft drinks, our Zero Sugar innovation continues to perform well with modest elasticity impacts and stronger velocities than the overall Zero Sugar and diet category.\nIn premium water, core hydration grew dollar consumption 35% in the quarter, driving almost 2 full points of share growth. Snapple, led by the success of our Snapple brand Refresh and Snapple Elements, drove dollar consumption growth of 15% and share growth of almost 1 full point in the quarter. And in seltzers, our partnership with Polar continues to drive growth for the brand with ACV increasing 6 points and share gains of 2 points.\nMoving to Coffee. Before discussing category dynamics, let me quickly share some context on our business and the performance improvements that are now beginning to materialize. You will recall that the combination of consistently strong consumer demand and supply constraints led to a pod shortage starting in late 2021. Consequently, we pulled back on our demand investment, as did most of our partners and launched the coffee supply chain recovery program to increase pod output and rebuild finished goods inventories for all parties in the Keurig ecosystem.\nWe completed the program last quarter and have now restored inventories across the ecosystem, which enables us, along with our partners and customers, to resume investments in demand-generating programs to drive category growth. As a result, the single-serve pod category continues to recover from supply constraints with dollar consumption up 6% in the quarter, advancing to 7% in September and off to a good start in quarter 4. There has been considerable noise in the broader at-home coffee category numbers well beyond single-serve coffee that is worth discussing further.\nA combination of increased consumer mobility, retail price actions and the reduction in advertising and promotion spend, the latter related to the single-serve supply challenges, negatively impacted at-home coffee category demand over the summer. Our analysis suggests that consumer mobility had the outsized impact. With mobility returning to more normal patterns once the school year started, we are seeing sequential improvement in at-home coffee demand. Importantly, single-serve coffee outperformed all other forms of at-home coffee during quarter 3. Further, the away-from-home coffee category, while still down significantly versus pre-COVID levels, continues to improve with further runway as returning to office behavior builds.\nLooking specifically to KDP coffee performance, KDP manufactured pod consumption was up 4% on a dollar basis in the third quarter, with owned and licensed brand consumption growing by 5% as the McCafe, Donut Shop and Green Mountain brands posted a strong growth. Performance strength during the quarter with year-over-year dollar and volume share advancing sequentially in September versus July and August and continuing to improve into the fourth quarter.\nKDP continues to maintain its strong leadership position in the category, with market share for KDP manufactured pods at approximately 82%. Moving forward, we expect mix to shift for KDP manufactured pods from private label to branded as community coffee comes on board beginning late this year.\nTurning to brewers. Today, we are confirming that we are on track to add 2 million new households into the Keurig system in 2022, which is consistent with our long-term algorithm. As discussed many times, we expect the elevated rate of 3 million new households that we attracted in 2020 and 2021 to normalize post COVID, and that's exactly what's happening in 2022. Of course, we don't need to sell as many brewers to support 2 million new households as we did to support 3 million, which explains the 15% decline in brewer shipments in the third quarter. Remember, we are in the household penetration business, not the brewer sales business, as we largely breakeven on brewer sales and generate nearly all of our profits from attracting new consumers into the Keurig ecosystem.\nTaking a longer-term perspective, Borderfree brewer sales were a healthy 16% above 2019, and on a year-to-date basis, brewer shipments are up more than 30% versus the first 3 quarters of 2019. In addition, single-serve brewers continue to hold the #1 position in the at-home brewer segment and KDP continues to grow share, driven by strong innovation across all consumer price points.\nFinally, our Latin American Beverages segment continued to post exceptionally strong results in the third quarter, net sales advancing 29% and operating income was up 14%, the latter on top of 48% growth in the third quarter of last year. Leading this strong performance in the quarter were Penafiel, Clamato, Mott's and Squirt.\nEarlier this month, we announced a strategic partnership to sell and distribute Red Bull in Mexico starting in quarter 4. The majority of the revenue we generate in our Latin America Beverages segment is from Mexico, and we are excited to enter into this win-win partnership with Red Bull, which will strengthen our position in the energy category, improve our go-to-market scale and drive efficiencies over time.\nAnd now I will hand it over to George to cover our third quarter performance in a bit more detail.\n\nGeorge Lagoudakis\n\nInterim CFO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Ozan, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a brief review of our third quarter business and financial highlights and then provide detail on our segment results. As usual, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis.\nTotal company net sales increased 11.8% to $3.6 billion with growth across all segments led by continued exceptional performance of our cold beverage business. Higher net price realization of 12.1% was only slightly offset by a volume/mix decline of 0.3%. Adjusted gross profit grew 8.6% in the quarter, reflecting our significant pricing that is beginning to approach the level of inflation we experienced in Q3, also benefit the performance of productivity. As previously discussed, we incurred our highest quarterly year-over-year increase in green coffee cost this year, pressuring our gross margin, which declined versus a year ago to 54.8%.\nAdjusted operating income increased 2% in the quarter as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased outbound transportation, warehouse and labor costs as well as higher marketing investment to support our back half plans. As a result, adjusted operating margin declined 250 basis points to 26.1%. Adjusted net income increased 4.3% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the operating income growth and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 4.5% in the quarter to $0.46. Free cash flow remained strong at $686 million, driving our free cash flow conversion ratio to 105% in the quarter.\nTurning now to our segment performance in the quarter. Packaged Beverages net sales grew 13.6%, driven by higher net price realization and volume/mix that was even with year ago. This impressive volume/mix performance reflects the strength of our brands, coupled with effective marketing and strong in-market execution. As a result, we continue to hold our multiyear share gain in CSDs, and we gained additional share in other LRB categories, including premium unflavored waters, seltzer, teas, juice and fruit drinks. In an increasingly challenging economic backdrop, our packaging mix capability across our portfolio enable consumers to easily pursue options that fit their budgets. Mini cans were notably our fastest-growing CSD packages by volume in the quarter.\nOur continued in-market effectiveness was supported by highly effective marketing investment during the quarter, including the season 5 launch of the highly successful Dr Pepper Fansville episodic drama. In recognition of its continuing brand strength, Dr Pepper were recognized by Canada as 1 of the top 20 most valuable global food and beverage brands.\nTurning to Snapple. This important brand was a standout in Q3, registering the strongest share performance in the tea category, led by Snapple Elements launched earlier this year with the reimagined packaging and bold new flavors. Elements has driven strong [trial] and repeat rates and it's proving highly incremental to the brand.\nAdjusted operating income for the Packaged Beverages segment increased 7.9% after accounting for a double-digit increase in marketing investment as pricing and productivity more than offset higher inflation in the period.\nTurning to Beverage Concentrates, which posted strong and balanced growth in the quarter. Net sales advanced 17.3% with favorable net price realization and higher volume/mix. The strong net sales performance was fueled by Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Crush. Adjusted operating income for December for the segment increased 21%, driven by the strong net sales growth and lower marketing expense due to timing.\nCoffee Systems net sales grew 5.2% in the quarter, driven by our recent pricing actions and higher pod shipments. Volume/mix declined in the quarter as a 3.5% growth in pod shipments was more than offset by a decline in brewer shipments. As Ozan mentioned, brewer shipments were down 15% versus last year but 16% above the pre-COVID period. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decreased 15.7%, primarily due to broad-based inflation, which included the highest year-over-year green coffee cost this year. Higher price realization and productivity continue to lag inflation, but we expect an improved relations in Q4 as the year-over-year inflation rate moderate significantly from the Q3 peak and the contribution from previous pricing actions becomes fully realized in the Coffee P&L.\nAnd finally, Latin America Beverages net sales advanced an impressive 28.8%, balanced between higher net price realization and increased volume/mix. The strong net sales performance in the quarter was led by Penafiel, Clamato, Mott's and Squirt. Adjusted operating income increased 13.5%, reflecting the strong growth in net sales and productivity, partially offset by inflation and the significant increase in marketing investment, which increased at a faster rate than the sales growth.\nI would like to now spend a moment discussing our expectations for the balance of the year. Our strong execution gives us confidence in our outlook, and we are reaffirming our guidance for full year net sales growth in the low double-digit range and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range.\nSupporting this guidance, we expect the following assumptions: adjusted interest expense is expected to approximately $425 million; adjusted effective tax rate is expected at the high end of our guidance range of 22% to 22.5%; diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion.\nWith that, let me hand it back to Ozan for some closing remarks.\n\nOzan Dokmecioglu\n\nCEO & Director, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, George. Before moving to question and answer, let me spend a moment on recent organizational announcements. On Monday, we announced the appointment of our new CFO, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, who will be joining us on November 14. Sudhanshu is a seasoned global finance, strategy, and operations executive with significant global experience, including in the beverage and retail industries. He will be a strategic partner to our team as we deliver against our commitments, scale our business for growth and continue to successfully navigate the complex macro environment. We look forward to introducing him to you soon.\nEarlier this month, we announced a strategic realignment of our supply chain organization to accelerate enterprise-wide productivity and speed of decision-making. In doing so, we leveraged our strong supply chain bench, promoting 3 experienced supply chain leaders with Roger Johnson becoming our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. The move builds on our strong supply chain foundation, and we believe positions us well as we head into 2023.\nIn closing, we believe that our attractive organic growth, coupled with our significant inorganic value creation opportunity, will enable us to continue to drive strong total shareholder return results over time. We are excited about the talent and the structure we are building to continue to execute against our opportunities with excellence. I will now hand it back to the operator for your questions.",

Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of 2022. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\n\nSteve Alexander\n\nSenior Director of IR, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let me start this morning by introducing our new Senior Director of IR Chethan Mallela who joined us in May. Many of you may know, Chethan from his 6 years working on the sell side with Andrew Lazar of Barclays, followed by IR roles over the past few years at American Eagle Outfitters and Peloton. He's a great addition to our team, and we believe you will enjoy working with them.\nEarlier this morning, we issued our press release for the second quarter of 2022. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website in the Investors section. Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. Beginning last quarter, you may recall that we began excluding the impact of foreign currency translation from our adjusted results.\nThe company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and on appropriate basis for discussion of our performance.\nDetails of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.

A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman, President & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was one of significant progress for our company in a macro environment that continues to be challenging on many fronts. Broad-based inflation continues to impact industry margins as pricing continues to increase but is not yet caught up to inflation. The good news is our brand strength has held up well in the face of new pricing with modest elasticity impacts across our portfolio during the quarter.\nWith concerns having shifted to the potential for a recession, it's worth spending a moment on how our categories have performed during previous recessionary period. During the last significant economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, our lead segment, particularly carbonated soft drinks and coffee were among the CPG categories that held up best. These categories are true staples with regular consumption behaviors and few direct substitutes, and they have the benefit from the trade-down effect from out-of-home consumption to in-home consumption that frequently occurs during recession.\nAs we've done successfully in the past, we will continue to manage KDP against a range of potential macro outcomes and believe that the all-weather business model we've created positions us well as we continue to operate in a challenging environment with significant uncertainty. Since the formation of KDP, we have delivered great returns for our shareholders with a 4-year total shareholder return in excess of 100%, well above broad market indices and nearly all food and beverage peers.\nMore notable is that these returns were delivered during our transition from a closely held company to a widely held one, with the public market absorbing approximately 675 million new shares into the float, equivalent to $25 in market cap. With our inclusion last month in the S&P 500, along with our existing position in the NASDAQ 100, we continue to broaden our appeal.\nLet me take a few minutes to remind you how the KDP business model creates value and then I'll let Ozan apply that framework to our Q2 results. KDP is underpinned by an attractive and competitive organic total shareholder return algorithm driven by a flexible and scalable strategy. Coffee Systems, our strategy is focused on attracting about 2 million new households every year into the Keurig system, while also driving revenue and profit growth among our 36 million existing Keurig households through new platforms such as connected brewers and new beverage formats and occasion.\nGiven the size of the remaining addressable new households for the Keurig system, which we estimate at more than 50 million, we have line of sight to household growth well beyond the next 10 years.\nIn cold beverages, our strategy is focused on driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation, filling white space in our portfolio through internal innovation and external partnership and enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including our company-owned direct store distribution system.\nThe investments we have made in selling and distribution have built a stronger go-to-market capability that has a multiplier effect on our brand investment as evidenced by our consistent share growth. In addition to our core algorithm, KDP's extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation. I will elaborate on this later in the call. Ozan, over to you.\n\nOzan Dokmecioglu\n\nCFO & President of International, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Bob provided an overview of our successful growth strategy, and I want to spend a moment to highlight our quarter 2 results in the context of our overall strategy.\nOn a total company basis, net sales advanced 13.5% with net price up more than 10% and volume mix up more than 3%, with all 4 segments posting strong growth. KDP adjusted gross profit increased 10%, while adjusted gross margin declined 180 basis points, reflecting the timing up that remains between pricing and inflation.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced cost of goods sold inflation across all inputs, including ingredients, packaging and manufacturing labor. In addition, we also experienced a much higher rate of inflation in transportation and warehousing at the time of robust consumer demand, and SG&A inflation was also significantly higher.\nTaken together, our total inflation for the quarter exceeded 17%, which was more than 2 percentage points higher than the 15% we experienced in quarter 1. As a result, adjusted operating income declined slightly, as significantly higher cost to serve offset the 10% increase in adjusted gross profit in the quarter.\nAll in, adjusted net income increased approximately 3%, reflecting a lower adjusted tax rate and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased 3% to $0.39, and we closed out the first half of this year very much as expected. Free cash flow for the quarter at $600 million continued to be strong, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of 108%.\nLet's shift to a discussion of segment performance, starting with Coffee Systems. I'm happy to report that our coffee supply recovery plan has been completed ahead of schedule with part manufacturing output restored to levels that will provide full service to our partners and retailers. While the success came at a cost, as we discussed last quarter, it sets us up for a strong second half of the year.\nFor the quarter, Coffee Systems net sales were up 9%, driven by both higher pricing and increased volume mix, reflecting strong sequential improvement in sales. For the quarter, pod sales grew 10%, led by both higher pricing and higher volume mix. While brewer sales grew almost 6%, led by higher pricing that was partially offset by lower volume due to the 29% volume growth comparison in quarter 2 last year.\nMarketing investment in the quarter was up slightly. Single-serve coffee category pricing was up nearly 9% and during the quarter based on IRI, as coffee brands and retailers mitigate the impact of inflation, particularly in coffee with new price actions. We have noted a few industry reports directly linking category volume deceleration in IRI with pricing actions and attempting to draw conclusions on (inaudible).\nIn addition to our typical caveat that syndicated data reflects only about 50% of total pod sales, let me also caution you that there are significant noise in the category numbers in quarter 2 due to the impact of supply chain issues, including out of stocks and significantly reduced category, promotional and marketing support.\nThere are also some timing impacts from consumer mobility with regard to out-of-home coffee consumption during the quarter. As we move into the second half, we continue to expect a strong dollar consumption growth in the category with some ongoing volume pressure related to increased consumer mobility compared to the prior year. This is consistent with our prior expectations that at home attachment rates would eventually return to pre-COVID levels, and we are continuing to see this occur.\nAt the same time, we are seeing improvement in office coffee, which we expect to gradually improve over time. In this dynamic environment, we continue to track the relationship between single-serve coffee pricing and other forms of coffee, including out-of-home coffee. Despite the increase in single-serve pricing, the gaps between formats have remained consistent as all forms of coffee have increased in price.\nLet me shift to some highlights of Coffee System growth drivers. In quarter 3, we will nationally launch our new K-Cafe Smart brewer, which in one machine is a representation of the cumulative enhancements we have made to Keurig brewers over the past 5 years. The K-Cafe Smart is enabled by our connected global ID technology that recognizes the pod and adjust the brew for a perfect cup. It also features multi-stream technology, which enabled a wider range of temperature and strength, including our best-ever brew over ice coffee delivery yet.\nThis new brewer also incorporates a new multi-speed product to enable consumers to create cappuccinos, lattes and other specialty coffees, guided by an interactive recipe experience located in the Keurig app. Taken together, the K-Cafe Smart enables consumers to create a coffee shop experience in home at a fraction of the cost and with greater appeal to younger households.\nWith our continued smart technology development, we remain on track to reach 1 million connected households in the next few years, which continues to unlock new platforms such as smart auto delivery for pods. The enhancement to Keurig system quality and innovation continue to be recognized by key industry players. And we are pleased to announce the additional 2 new super premium coffee brands into the system with Intelligentsia and BLK & Bold & joining our roster of Keurig partners.\nIn addition to enabling the Keurig system to reach premium consumers with price points of around $1 per pod. The participation of these brands provides a strong endorsement for the quality of the coffee delivered by our new brewers.\nLast quarter, we shared that community coffee will also be joining the system as a partner brand. Production of K-Cup pods for community began this month, and our licensed pods will be available on keurig.com and at retail nationwide later this year.\nIn addition to adding new brands, we have had great success in driving growth in existing brands. McCafe, which you will recall joined the Keurig system as a licensed brand a few years ago, was the fastest-growing brand in single-serve coffee this past quarter.\nShifting to cold beverages. We again grew or held market share across the vast majority of our portfolio. In carbonated soft drinks, we grew dollar consumption by 11% in the quarter and are holding on slightly expanding the substantial share gains we achieved over the past 2-plus years. This past July 4 holiday represented the 23rd consecutive holiday period in which KDP grew carbonated soft drinks market share. We are doing this by leveraging the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, successful innovations such as Dr Pepper & Cream Soda, which was recently run by IRI as the #1 food and beverage pace setter for 2021, as well as exceptional in-market execution and effective marketing.\nCORE hydration and Snapple, our 2 examples of strength in our noncarbonated portfolio, both of which had been held backed by supply chain disruption last year. CORE is the fastest-growing brand in the premium unflavored water category this year with dollar consumption growth of 31% in quarter 2.\nSnapple is benefiting from investment in the Snapple brand refresh launched last year, which continues to attract younger consumers and build momentum for the brand, driving dollar market share growth year-to-date. We have also had great success in driving growth for our partner brands with Polar Seltzer becoming the fastest-growing and is within sparkling water brand in the category, advancing market share 2 full share points to 10.3% in the quarter and continuing to grow.\nIn addition, Vita Coco grew over 16% in the quarter, advancing household penetration by 9% and dollar share by more than 4 points to 54%. Within cold beverages, Packaged Beverages net sales were up 13%, driven by both higher pricing and increased volume mix with elasticity impact remaining modest.\nIncreased marketing investment and strong in-market execution supported continued market share growth in the quarter. For beverage concentrate, net sales were up 23%, reflecting higher pricing, including the benefit of favorable timing related to trade accords and higher volume mix.\nFinally, for Latin America Beverages, net sales were up an impressive 27%, balance between higher net pricing and increased volume mix supported by a significant increase in marketing investment. Elasticity for the segment remained modest. Latin America Beverages has been a consistently strong performer, led by a portfolio of strong brands such as Penafiel, Clamato, Squirt and Mott’s.\nOn a 2-year basis, net sales in the quarter increased more than 50%. During the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire the global rights to the non-alcohol, ready-to-drink cocktail brand Atypique, which is a highly unique offering in the emerging and fast-growing non-alcohol cocktail segment in Canada. This new platform complements our strong and successful ready-to-drink alcohol portfolio in Canada and provides KDP with incremental growth opportunities in an exciting new category.\nWe completed our minority investment in Tractor Beverage and signed an exclusive sales agreement to expand innovation in food service channels, leveraging the strength of our fountain foodservice sales team. As we announced last quarter, Tractor offers the first and only certified organic, non-GMO beverage solutions specifically tailored to foodservice operators. While these are great examples of small but strategic investment, let me turn it over to Bob to provide some commentary on the broader capital allocation, an M&A opportunity for KDP, which will be one of his key focus areas as Executive Chairman.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman, President & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nWe have built a business that has been pressured tested by macro volatility and crisis and has emerged stronger and nimbler than ever. In the past 4 years, we have distinguished ourselves as strong operators with the great majority of our team members solely focused on running the business with excellence.\nValue of that approach is reflected in our industry-leading TSR since merger and our attractive forward-looking organic algorithm. We also know we have an opportunity to enhance organic shareholder returns through the strategic deployment of our discretionary free cash flow. We have a proven capability to build new brands and create exceptional value for KDP and our partners by adding new brands into our growth machine.\nLook no further than the examples discussed during today's call, such as CORE, Polar, Vita Coco and McCafe cafe. Therefore, it's logical for us to consider M&A as our leading opportunity in capital allocation. We employ a disciplined and rigorous process in our deal evaluation, which balances risk versus reward and understands the true underlying value of any new business to us.\nWe also consider a range of structures to enable us to expand our brand portfolio with M&A being one, but not the only path to filling white space. It's no secret that historically, when our disciplined approach has faced lofty valuation expectations from sellers, the outcome has been fewer acquisitions and more strategic partnership for KDP. We're good with that.\nAs we know that no deal or an alternative partnership structure is far better than an overpriced acquisition. The environment for high-growth companies has shifted in recent months, and we're encouraged with the conversations that we're having with several potential partners.\nWe believe that our proven success in creating value for our partners, combined with a more challenging investor environment for these entrepreneurs, has begun to narrow the bid-ask spread. Time will tell if that improves actionability.\nAll potential M&A investments compete against the asset this team knows best, which is the value of our own equity. As noted in our press release, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $34.51 per share. We see opportunistic share buybacks and investment in our internal growth projects as attractive uses of our capital.\nFinally, we believe the size of our discretionary cash flow which is expected to be $5 billion over the next 3 years, distinguishes us as a unique investment opportunity. Ozan will now provide some commentary on our outlook for the balance of the year before we move to Q&A.\n\nOzan Dokmecioglu\n\nCFO & President of International, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nAs indicated in our press release, we are increasing our guidance for full year constant currency net sales growth to the low double-digit range while reaffirming adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth in the second half to reach the high single-digit range, driven by strong performance in the fourth quarter, leading to mid-single-digit growth for the year.\nSupporting this guidance, we continue to expect the following unchanged assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the 22% to 22.5% range. And diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion, assuming no additional share buybacks.\nFinally, given the current environment, I want to share some detailed perspective on our expectations for the second half. At this point in the year, we are largely covered on input costs and have good line of sight to price realization. Quarter 4 is expected to be the strongest of the year in terms of earnings per share delivery, while quarter 3 is expected to look much like quarter 2.\nThe primary driver of the phasing of our second half result is the timing relationship between pricing and inflation. You will recall that inflation in quarter 1 was 15%, which advanced to more than 17% in quarter 2. We expect inflation to be even higher in quarter 3, largely driven by our green coffee positions.\nBecause we are getting the benefit of more pricing in our quarter 3 P&L, we expect to offset this incremental inflation to deliver EPS growth for the quarter. In quarter 4, we expect the rate of inflation versus the prior year to be roughly half the rate of quarter 3.\nAs a reminder, we will be lapping the significant spike in inflation we experienced in quarter 4 last year, and we will realize the full benefits of pricing already taken, which will enable us to offset inflation and deliver margin improvement in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, I want to acknowledge that tomorrow, I will assume the CEO role of KDP. I am honored to take on the leadership of this great company, including our 27,000 dedicated employees, and I greatly appreciate the endorsement and support of Bob, our Board of Directors and our executive leadership team.\nLooking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the growth potential I see for KDP in this new chapter. We have the opportunity to leverage all the progress we made since the merger to further restrain our brands, enhance our go-to-market capabilities, build our world-class team. Doing this will enable us flawlessly execute our strategic plan, while standing ready to proactively capitalize on new opportunities that come our way and face whatever macro challenges arise.\nJust as we did in our last chapter, the KDP team has distinguished itself as flexible, nimble and fast. And it is these key attributes that will again differentiate us moving forward. I will now hand it back to the operator for your questions.",

Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper's earnings call for the first quarter of 2022. This conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\n\nSteve Alexander\n\nSenior Director of IR, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the first quarter of 2022. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website in the Investors section.\nConsistent with previous quarters, today, we'll be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. Beginning with this quarter, we will also exclude the impact of foreign currency translation from our adjusted results. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends.\nWhile the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.\nHere with us today to discuss our first quarter 2022 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman, President & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results reflect different stories of challenges faced and progress achieved across our portfolio. One common thread, however, is the continued strong consumer demand for our brands, as demonstrated by consumption growth and share expansion.\nIn Coffee Systems, the story is one of accelerated supply recovery to enable us to fuel the continued strong growth of the Keurig system, following our addition of 6 million new households in the past 2 years. As discussed previously, the December-January Omicron wave caused widespread labor outages that resulted in supply shortfalls in coffee pods at a time when consumer demand was at a record high. As the first quarter progressed, we accelerated our efforts to rebuild pod manufacturing capacity, increase finished goods inventories and improve service levels. Our first coffee pricing actions intended to mitigate inflation also began hitting shelves in the quarter with single-serve coffee pod pricing up more than 5% at retail during the quarter, with additional pricing still to come.\nAcross our cold portfolio, it's a story of continued volume growth. At the same time, we're implementing meaningful pricing actions, with the combination leading to double-digit revenue growth in Packaged Beverages, Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. Given that we're still in the steep portion of the inflation curve, the timing of pricing is lagging inflation, which leads to pressure on margins. Looking forward, we believe there will be an inflection point in which high current costs begin to lap elevated year-ago costs, leading to lower year-over-year inflation comparisons.\nAt the same time, pricing actions will have caught up, which we expect will lead to margin recovery. As we look forward, we believe our cold beverage portfolio will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year, and we are confident that our coffee production output and inventory levels will have fully recovered by the end of Q2. Therefore, we have increased our 2022 full year guidance for net sales from mid-single digits to high single digits while maintaining our EPS guidance at mid-single-digit growth.\nLooking at Q1 earnings and EPS, Ozan will discuss the key drivers of results in the quarter. But the biggest headlines are the relationship between inflation and pricing and the investments we've made in the business, particularly in coffee. Taken together, we delivered modest net earnings growth and adjusted EPS in line with a year ago. During the quarter, inflation, which was significant across the board, particularly for inputs such as coffee, resins, aluminum and sweeteners as well as transportation and labor, approached 15%, which is higher than we expected entering the year.\nWithin our segments, Packaged Beverages again reported another standout quarter with net sales advancing 13% on volume growth of 5% and pricing up 8%. In-market performance also remained very strong with market share growth registered in almost 90% of our cold beverage portfolio, led by continued strength of CSDs along with seltzers, coconut waters, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks. Performance of Snapple and Core continued to improve from the material availability issues faced in 2021 with both brands posting improved market share results in the quarter and upcoming innovation and marketing plans for this summer expected to accelerate this progress.\nBai continues to recover from supply issues last year, posting consumption growth for the past 4 consecutive quarters. Margins for Packaged Beverages were impacted by escalating inflation, which outpaced the timing of pricing as well as ongoing transportation and labor challenges. We expect new pricing actions already announced to the trade to be in market late in the second quarter.\nIn Coffee Systems, we undershipped consumption with negative KDP net sales for the quarter comparing to 3.6% K-Cup pod consumption growth as measured by IRI. You'll recall from our fourth quarter discussion that record consumer demand for K-Cup pods was challenged by production shortfalls as Omicron-related labor availability issues, combined with the delayed start-up of our new Spartanburg manufacturing facility, pressured our capacity.\nWe prioritized our service recovery during the quarter to partners and customers at the expense of our owned and licensed brands to rebuild our internal inventory levels. While that was the right decision from a Keurig ecosystem perspective, it came at a significant cost to KDP in terms of both revenue and profit. We made significant progress during the quarter in restoring our coffee supply chain with K-Cup pod production, finished goods inventory and customer service all improving by double digits. We now expect a full inventory recovery by the end of Q2, enabling Coffee Systems to return to normal service levels in the second half of this year. Supporting this recovery is new manufacturing equipment we expect to come online as the year progresses, which will ensure supply to meet strong consumer demand in the second half of this year and in 2023.\nAs we continue to work on coffee recovery and rebuild our finished goods inventory in the second quarter, we expect pod shipments to remain below consumption. That trend is expected to reverse in the second half of the year with shipments outpacing consumption as improved internal inventory positions will enable us to refill customer and partner inventories and return to driving our owned and licensed brands through marketing and promotion programs. This will result in a much improved top and bottom line performance for Coffee Systems in the second half of this year.\nPricing in coffee has also increased to mitigate the impact of inflation. Single-serve coffee category pricing increased 5.4% in the quarter as pricing actions continued to flow through at retail. KDP-manufactured brands pricing advanced 6.7% in the quarter. Given the escalating inflationary pressures, we recently announced another round of pricing that will be in market late in the second quarter.\nWhile navigating through the well-discussed macro challenges over the past 2 years, we have also maintained our focus on driving long-term sustainable growth through innovation, renovation and partnerships across the full KDP portfolio. Although these topics have received less airtime in our recent conversations, I'd like to take a few minutes to do so now, starting in Coffee Systems. You'll recall that in 2021, we debuted a new platform for Keurig with the launch of the K-Supreme Plus SMART connected brewer. This is the first of many new connected brewers to come, including the K-Café smart later this year. Consumer response to our connected brewer continues to be positive, and we believe that we will have more than 1 million connected households in the next few years.\nIn 2021, we also launched our popular Brew Over Ice feature on one of our smallest footprint brewers, our K-Slim + ICED coffeemaker, which debuted as a Target and keurig.com exclusive. More than half of K-Slim + ICED purchasers were households completely new to the Keurig system. We will be expanding retail availability of this model late this summer.\nNext week, we are launching the new K-Café Essentials model, our first brewer less than $100 that offers coffee, lattes and cappuccinos through a built-in milk frother. This brewer has scored an average 4.8 out of 5 stars in our consumer and influencer review programs, and we look forward to its debut as a Walmart exclusive.\nIn terms of coffee innovation, in January, we launched a Snickers-flavored K-Cup pod under The Original Donut Shop brand as an expansion of our flavored platform. This new product is already a top-selling variety where distributed with a national rollout planned for later this year.\nLastly, we are pleased to announce the Community Coffee, the largest family-owned retail coffee brand in the U.S., will be returning as a Keurig partner brand at the end of this year. The relaunch of our partnership after a 5-year hiatus is a testament to the quality, innovation, service and consumer insights the Keurig ecosystem can provide to coffee brands. We look forward to working together with Community -- the Community team to help accelerate their brand growth.\nShifting to cold beverages. We're excited to announce that we have agreed to make a minority equity investment in Tractor Beverage to expand innovation in the fountain and foodservice channels. Available nationally in Chipotle restaurants since 2020, Tractor offers the first and only certified organic, non-GMO beverage solution specifically tailored to foodservice operators. To enable Tractor to achieve widespread distribution across multiple food service channels, we have also agreed to enter into an exclusive sales agreement with Tractor that leverages the strength of our fountain foodservice sales team.\nKDP cold beverage innovation and renovation continues to be robust, and we have recently launched Snapple zero sugar; and Snapple Elements, a new line of teas and juice drinks inspired by the elements fire, rain and air. Snapple Elements line is made from all-natural ingredients with no artificial flavors or sweeteners and less sugar than traditional Snapple beverages. Snapple zero sugar is a rebranding of Diet Snapple, similar to what we've done with several key CSD brands, resulting in increased velocity.\nDuring the quarter, we launched 2 new CSDs, Simple 7UP, a new 7UP line with clean, simple ingredients and reduced sugar; as well as Sunkist mango orange to expand our fast-growing Sunkist brand lineup. Finally, returning this summer as a limited-time offer is a fan favorite, Dr Pepper Dark Berry, including zero sugar variety. The launch will feature promotional packaging tied to this summer's release of Jurassic World Dominion.\nI'll now turn it over to Ozan to take you through more highlights of the quarter.\n\nOzan Dokmecioglu\n\nCFO & President of International, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a brief review of our first quarter business and financial highlights and then turn to our outlook for 2022. As usual, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis. And as Steve mentioned, beginning this quarter, our adjusted results now exclude the impact of foreign currency translation.\nAs mentioned earlier, our top line was again quite strong for the quarter as Packaged Beverages advanced a significant 13%, along with very strong growth for Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. As expected, Coffee Systems net sales declined in the quarter as the segment prioritized shipments to branded and private label partners and to rebuilding inventory, which improved sequentially in the quarter.\nAll in, net sales advanced 6.1% to $3.1 billion with net price realization up 6.3% and volume mix down slightly. Excluding Coffee Systems, net sales advanced 12.8% and volume mix was up 4.6%. On a 2-year basis, net sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% versus 2020, with all 4 segments growing.\nAdjusted gross profit was up 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the impacts of the significant pricing actions we put in place and productivity savings. Escalating inflationary pressures combined with ongoing supply chain disruption and labor constraints were significant offsets as the timing of pricing continues to lag inflation. As a result, adjusted gross margin declined 280 basis points versus year ago to 52.7%.\nAdjusted operating income declined 1.2% in the quarter, reflecting the significant impact of inflation, including the ongoing impacts of macro, supply chain and labor challenges, partially offset by our strategic asset investment and other benefits that enabled continued investment in the business. Adjusted operating margin declined 170 basis points to 23.8%. On a 2-year basis, adjusted operating income increased 6.7% versus 2020.\nDespite the inflationary pressures, we maintained our investment in brand marketing. In fact, while we reduced the spending in Coffee Systems due to supply limitations, we increased marketing spending in our cold beverage brands by 7%. During the quarter, we also made significant investments to accelerate coffee recovery and get us back to normalized inventory positions and service levels to realize our full growth potential in the second half of 2022. Those investments were focused on additional labor, warehousing and transportation capacity.\nAs Bob mentioned, we prioritized partner and customer brands over our owned and licensed brands for the long-term benefit of the ecosystem but with a short-term profit and revenue hit to us in the quarter. These incremental investments were paid for in part by a $38 million benefit in the quarter from our strategic asset investment program, along with a $28 million benefit in noncash stock compensation expense and a $28 million benefit in legal fees.\nAdjusted net income in the quarter increased approximately 1%, primarily reflecting lower interest expense, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.33 in the quarter, essentially even with year ago.\nFree cash flow for the quarter at $632 million continued to be strong, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of over 133%. During the quarter, further strengthening our cash position, we received a $350 million settlement from the successful resolution of our litigation against BODYARMOR, which was used to reduce financial obligations. At the end of the quarter, unrestricted cash on hand totaled $592 million.\nAs announced earlier this month, we completed a $3 billion strategic refinancing given the current interest rate environment. Since the time of the merger nearly 4 years ago, we have generated significant cash flow and rapidly delevered. This strategic refinancing further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity profile with extended maturities and more favorable rates that will lower our interest expense.\nTurning now to our segment performance in the quarter. Packaged Beverages again delivered double-digit net sales growth with the first quarter up more than 13%, driven by favorable net price realization and higher volume mix, the latter reflecting continued market share expansion and strong in-market execution across the portfolio. On a 2-year basis, net sales increased an impressive 21% versus 2020.\nAdjusted operating income increased 16.9%, reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity, combined with the strategic asset investment program benefit of $38 million. These benefits were significantly offset by the unfavorable impacts of escalating inflation and macro supply chain disruption and labor constraints that drove higher-than-anticipated costs to serve the continued strong consumer demand we experienced.\nBeverages Concentrates also posted double-digit net sales growth, approximating 10% in the quarter, led by favorable net price realization and higher volume mix. The volume mix performance was driven by higher fountain foodservice volume due to improving but still recovering consumer mobility in restaurant and hospitality channels. On a 2-year basis, net sales advanced almost 17% in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 3.3% in the quarter, driven by the strong net sales growth, meaningfully offset by the impacts of escalating inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment.\nLatin America Beverages also posted double-digit growth in net sales, approximating 18%, essentially balanced between higher net price realization and increased volume mix. On a 2-year basis, Latin America net sales increased an impressive 26% versus 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 13%, reflecting the strong growth in net sales, partially offset by broad-based inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment.\nAnd finally, Coffee Systems net sales in the quarter declined 4.3%. This reflects the impact of rebuilding our internal inventory positions, combined with prioritizing shipments to branded and private label partners for which we receive lower revenue recognition per pod than we do with our owned and licensed brands. In addition, Coffee Systems faced a significant comparison to the first quarter last year where net sales increased 17%. On a 2-year basis, Coffee Systems net sales increased 12% versus 2020.\nWe achieved higher Coffee Systems net price realization of 3.2% in the quarter, which was driven by pricing actions taken primarily on our owned and licensed pods in late 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 combined with sequentially lower retailer fines incurred in the first quarter. Lower volume mix in the quarter of 7.5% reflected comparison to the strong 19.5% growth in the year-ago period and the impact of our coffee recovery program. Consequently, pod and brewer shipment volume declined 5.2% versus a year ago, comping the strong growth of 14% and 61%, respectively, in the year-ago period.\nAdjusted operating income decreased 24% in the quarter. While this performance reflected the higher net price realization we achieved, it continued to lag inflation and the cost of our recovery plan. This plan, which will continue through the second quarter, accelerated customer service recovery to partners and retail customers quickly. However, it added significant costs during the quarter.\nI would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations as the year unfolds in the context of the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to be our most challenging period this year due to the timing dynamic between inflation and pricing and in comparison to quarter 1 last year before inflation spiked, coupled with our need to invest heavily in coffee supply. With the first quarter now behind us, we continue to believe it will prove to be the toughest this year.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered strong brand growth, implemented new pricing actions and delivered significant improvements in coffee production, customer service levels and inventory. As we look ahead, we expect continued strong revenue growth driven by innovation, renovation, partnerships and are pleased that we will be in the position to invest in marketing to restore full demand to our coffee business in the second half as inventories are rebuilt. As discussed this morning, accelerating coffee recovery and investing in our cold beverage marketing came at a cost in quarter 1. However, we have the flexibility to leverage our strategic asset investment program and other onetime benefits to cover these investments. This puts us in position for accelerated revenue growth in second half, including unconstrained growth in coffee.\nLooking ahead, inflation still looms as the greatest challenge and has proven difficult to forecast even for the experts. We continue to lock in coverage on all items where possible, have implemented additional pricing and are ready to add more pricing if required. We have and will continue to protect our marketing investment as we believe brand strength and stability to lessen pricing elasticity is a key competitive advantage for KDP.\nAs discussed on the last call, we also see the strategic asset investment program as an ongoing effective tool to drive marketing investment in an environment marked by significant cost pressures. Our confidence in our top line led us to increase our guidance for full year net sales growth to the high single-digit range while reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. Supporting this guidance, we continue to expect the following unchanged assumptions.\nAdjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million, including the benefit of our recent strategic refinancing, which was planned early this year. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion.\nFinally, while we don't provide quarterly guidance given the current environment, I want to share that we expect the second quarter to show modest sequential adjusted earnings per share improvement versus the first quarter with more meaningful improvement in the second half. Specifically, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to strengthen during the year, reaching the high single-digit range in the second half, which would put us on our long-term algorithm for the period, translating to mid-single-digit growth for the full year.\nWith that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman, President & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nBefore moving to Q&A, I want to recognize Steve Alexander for his recent promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations. Many of you on this call have had the opportunity to work with Steve during his 15 years with KDP and Dr Pepper Snapple and have benefited from his strong understanding of the beverage industry.\nAnd finally, earlier this month, we announced that I will be transitioning my CEO role to Ozan at the end of July, and I will remain Executive Chairman for the following 2 years. This transition was designed to ensure continuity of leadership and strategic direction for KDP as well as to enable dedicated focus on the new and very significant inorganic value-creation opportunity we have in front of us.\nI have tremendous confidence in Ozan based on working side by side with him over the past 6 years, and I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to partner with him, the KDP executive team and the KDP Board of Directors over the next few years.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.",

Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question and answer session at the end of the call.\nI would now like to introduce Keurig Dr. Pepper's Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\n\nSteve Alexander\n\nSenior Director of IR, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThank you. Hello, everyone, thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the fourth quarter of 2021. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website in the Investors section.\nConsistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided to the reconciliation tables [included] in our press release and our 10-K, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.\nHere with us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2021 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio-Gever.\nAnd finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\n\nRobert J. Gamgort\n\nExecutive Chairman, President & CEO, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As you'll recall, this past quarter represents the completion of our 3-year merger plan and the beginning of the next chapter of our transformation and growth, as we detailed for you during our Investor Day in October.\nWith the merger plan now in the record books, I am pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our key commitments, and we have demonstrated the power of our new company, with a significantly faster-growing business than at the time of the merger.\nThe volatile macro environment we have faced since the merger has tested the industry and our business. It has also provided the opportunity for KDP to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model and our ability to withstand unforeseen events and deliver on our long-term commitments.\nIn terms of a few specifics, our top line strength over the past 3 years is a standout, growing approximately 5% on a compound annual basis over the period, almost double the merger target of 2% to 3% growth. More importantly, our sales growth accelerated significantly over the 3 years, with 2021 net sales advancing nearly 8.5%.\nOur strength since merger extends well beyond our financial commitments, as we delivered high-quality in-market performance including broad-based market share growth across our portfolio and meaningful expansion of new households using the Keurig system.\nImportantly, we maintained top line growth each year since the onset of COVID, as we've been able to pivot to grow certain segments of our business faster to offset those that were, and in some cases continue to be, negatively impacted.\nMarket share expansion in cold beverages was driven by exceptional strength in CSDs, which have grown 1.5 share points since 2019.\nIn coffee, the Keurig ecosystem continues to expand, with 8 million new U.S. households added to the system since 2018.\nSince 2019, we've driven growth in KDP consolidated net sales of nearly 14% and an adjusted EPS of 31%. These results were fueled by strong execution, successful innovation and high-impact marketing.\nOn a 3-year basis, key financial metrics, including adjusted EPS, management leverage ratio and synergy capture, were delivered well within our merger target range, with adjusted EPS up more than 15% on a compound annual basis over the post-merger period.\nWe delivered this performance while building a solid foundation for the future, including the advancement of our corporate responsibility agenda, achieving the goals set before the merger and expanding into new areas, such as Diversity & Inclusion, Positive Hydration and Regenerative Agriculture. All of this is underpinned by a talented team and a culture that rewards bold thinking, speed and a mindset of ownership and accountability.\nInvestors who have been with us since the merger have been rewarded by a total shareholder return of 109%, which is more than 2x the consumer staples sector index and 2x the return of the S&P 500 Index.\nImportant to the delivery of these strong results is how we manage KDP. Our playbook includes a range of strategies and tactics that enable us to navigate through volatile conditions in the short term to stay true to our long-term vision. A good example is our strategic asset investment program, which we initially launched in 2019 and have used each year since, including in Q4 of 2021, to maintain or increase marketing investment in our brand portfolio. Ozan will discuss more in his remarks.\nLet's talk about the current environment we're facing. At this point in the earnings season, you are fully up to speed on the range of issues negatively impacting the CPG industry. Supply chain disruption driven by labor shortages, lack of material availability and broad transportation issues have reduced industry customer service levels and pressured gross margins. In addition, unprecedented levels of inflation across nearly all components of cost of goods and cost to serve necessitated multiple pricing actions across the industry, most of which lagged inflation in terms of timing in the market.\nThese challenges intensified in the fourth quarter with the onset of Omicron, causing significantly higher absenteeism across manufacturing and commercial frontline workforces. It has been reported that 6% of the U.S. workforce was absent at the start of the new year due to being affected with COVID or caring for someone who had been infected. As significant as that number is, it actually understates the real impact on supply chains.\nWe, for example, experienced absenteeism at key plants in the double digits, which magnified an already challenged labor situation, causing the workforce to drop below critical threshold levels.\nWe're certainly not alone. Our suppliers of inputs, transportation services and plant equipment are also experiencing these challenges, which has a compounding effect on our operations.\nOf course, we don't get paid to report the news, but rather to deliver our commitments regardless of the macro situation. That's exactly what we've done. By implementing an unprecedented set of actions to increase labor availability and prioritize our portfolio to ensure availability of the fastest-turning, [highest-profit] items.\nA tangible example of the challenges we faced and the solutions we've implemented is in Coffee Systems. Record consumer demand for K-Cup pods bumped up against lower manufacturing output and a delayed capacity availability, both directly related to COVID. This caused us to tap into our finished goods inventory in Q4, falling below safety stock levels, which impacted service to our partners and retailers.\nWe have successfully rebuilt production output since the height of Omicron absenteeism, but we are now servicing the continued high consumer demand while working to rebuild inventory, which is a process that will continue well into the next quarter. Ozan will talk more about the impact of the supply challenges in his comments.\nWhile we're seeing light at the end of the supply chain tunnel, as the wave of Omicron runs its course, inflationary pressure continues to be persistent. To address continued inflation, we implemented several pricing actions over the past 6 months and announced more pricing in early 2022. To date, our elasticities have held up nicely.\nMost of the challenges discussed today were reflected in the 2022 outlook we provided at our October Investor Day. At that time, we expected the impact of supply chain disruption and escalating inflation to be significant headwinds for the year, resulting in our projection for net sales and EPS growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for the full year.\nNearly 5 months since Investor Day, we continue to believe this guidance for the full year is realistic. Yet it's important to highlight the expected pacing of results throughout the year. Specifically, we expect Q1 to represent our most challenging comparison to last year as we manage through the peak levels of supply chain disruption and significant ongoing inflationary pressures. EPS performance is projected to improve starting in Q2, reaching high single-digit growth in the second half of 2022, which would put us back on our long-term algorithm.\nLet me take a few minutes to shift back to 2021 to highlight our full year results. Our top line performance continued to accelerate, with full year net sales growth of more than 8% and all 4 business segments up strongly.\nOur Packaged Beverages segment was a standout, posting double-digit net sales growth for the year, fueled by an impressive 17% increase in the fourth quarter.\nOur Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages segments also delivered strong double-digit net sales growth in 2021.\nWhile our coffee business posted net sales growth of 6% due to an almost 6% increase in pod shipments and a double-digit increase in brewer shipments.\nIn 2021, we added nearly 3 million new U.S. households to the Keurig system, on top of approximately 3 million new households added in 2020, which means total U.S. Keurig households are now approaching 36 million.\nAdjusted EPS for the year advanced more than (inaudible) percent, which translated to 31% EPS growth on a 2-year basis, as previously mentioned.\nStrong in-market performance for our brands underpins the delivery of our financials. Our LRB portfolio grew market share across nearly 75% of the portfolio in 2021 and almost 80% when looking at results on a 2-year basis. Most notable was continued strength in CSDs, which grew consumption by 26% and market share by 1.5 share points since 2019. In fact, KDP took over the #2 share position in CSDs in the grocery channel in 2021.\nThe drivers of our CSD performance are widespread and sustainable. While nearly all of our CSD brands continue to perform well, Dr Pepper was again one of the fastest-growing major CSD brands in the U.S. last year, and it was the single fastest-growing since 2019. When Fortune recently unveiled its Halo 100 ranking for how well brands serve their consumers, Dr Pepper was the only beverage brand in the top 100 and the only FMCG brand in the top 20.\nSunkist took over leadership of the fruit CSD segment in 2021, fueled by innovation. Since 2019, Sunkist has grown dollar consumption by 35%.\nWith the success of our Zero Sugar innovation in 2021, we gained over 3 share points in Zero Sugar CSDs, capturing 1/3 of the Zero Sugar category. And later this year, we will be launching Snapple Zero Sugar.\nLooking at other key segments of our cold beverage portfolio, our core Snapple and Bai brands, whose growth was capped in 2021 by supply chain disruptions, demonstrated positive in-market performance as product availability improved in Q3 and Q4.\nRetail consumption was up double digits for both CORE and Bai in the quarter, while Snapple was up 5% in the quarter and ended with double-digit growth in December. The Snapple Refresh, which was designed to bring younger consumers into the franchise with new graphics and sustainable packaging, is proving to be successful.\nOur premium water strength continues to be enhanced by strong partnerships. The success of Polar seltzer demonstrates the power of the KDP distribution network, as we continue to expand availability outside the Northeast region, achieving a 4.3% share for our first year in the market for which KDP is responsible for the brand.\nVita Coco, a long-term KDP partner in which we also made an equity investment in 2021, had an exceptional year, growing dollar consumption 33% and market share by almost 7 full percentage points to nearly 51% of the coconut water segment.\nSwitching to coffee, where retail dollar consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by KDP in tracked channels grew 2.7% for the year, with higher growth achieved in untracked channel due to continued strength in e-commerce and club and a limited return to offices. Growth would have been even higher if not for the Q4 supply chain disruptions which led to reduced promotions and increased out-of-stocks. KDP manufactured share remains strong, increasing to 83.2% for the year.\nAs mentioned previously, Keurig household penetration continued to be exceptional, adding 8 million new households to the Keurig system since 2018.\nFurther demonstrating the power of the Keurig system, for the first time ever, unit market share of Keurig-compatible brewers surpassed traditional drip coffee makers in the fourth quarter.\nIn 2021, we debuted a new platform for Keurig with the launch of the K-Supreme Smart Connected Brewer, which is the first of many new connected brewers to come. The consumer reception has been very strong. We have line of sight to having more than 1 million connected households in the next few years.\nFinally, although we don't give our Latin America Beverages segment much airtime on these calls, I'd like to point out that our team delivered 14% revenue growth and 19% operating income growth behind particular strength in Penafiel and Clamato. In addition to being a strong contributor to total company results, LAB represents an attractive expansion opportunity for KDP.\nBefore I turn it over to Ozan to talk about our 2021 results and our 2022 outlook in more detail, I'd like to reflect on our long-term outlook as discussed at our Investor Day. The completion of our merger period provides an opportunity to reflect on our accomplishments over the past 3 years as well as our potential over the next few years. While we will always manage our business through the challenges of the day, we measure ourselves on long-term value creation and therefore keep our focus on delivering in the present and investing for the future.\nAs we look to the future, one of the most attractive aspects of the KDP investment story is our unique potential to drive outsized returns through a combination of an attractive organic growth algorithm coupled with the opportunity for significant inorganic value creation.\nYou'll recall from our Investor Day, our outlook was to generate approximately $4 billion of discretionary free cash flow between 2022 and 2024. Since Investor Day, we have received proceeds from our BodyArmor investment as well as funds from the settlement of our litigation against BodyArmor. Combined, this resulted in cash proceeds approaching $1 billion, increasing our discretionary free cash flow outlook over the 3-year period to $5 billion. This cash flow is being prioritized to the highest ROI use of our capital, which we continue to believe is strategic M&A, where we have a differentiated and demonstrated management expertise and track record. Discretionary cash of $5 billion translates into more than $20 billion of M&A capacity, assuming the same reasonable expectations we discussed in October.\nComing out of Investor Day, we saw a few headlines suggesting that we were looking for a singular, large acquisition. Let me assure you that we remain intentional and disciplined in our allocation of capital and that the significance of our more than $20 billion in M&A firepower represents total capacity for M&A, not a singular or targeted deal size. In the absence of value-generating M&A, we will use our new share buyback authorization to opportunistically repurchase shares.\nOur effective deployment of free cash flow over the previous 3 years is a good example of how we think about shareholder value creation through deployment of capital. During that time period, debt repayment was our top priority and a strong generator of shareholder value. However, also during that time, we acquired the CORE, Big Red and Limitless brands, made an equity investment in Vita Coco and several startup businesses, brought 22 independent distributor territories into KDP to strengthen our company-owned DSD system and invested in expanded production capacity and high-return plant and warehouse automation projects. At the same time, we also passed on numerous M&A opportunities, including BodyArmor, one we believe it was more prudent to be on the sidelines or a seller rather than a buyer.\nWith our balance sheet and strong position and exceptional free cash flow in front of us, we're excited about our ability to continue to generate strong inorganic returns on top of our attractive organic TSR algorithm.\nLet me hand it over to Ozan.\n\nOzan Dokmecioglu\n\nCFO & President of International, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, which our press release discusses in significant detail, and then turning to our 2022 guidance. All of this discussion will be on an adjusted basis.\nConstant currency net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $3.49 billion, fueled by higher volume mix of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 4.1%. This performance was driven by 17% growth in Packaged Beverages as well as very strong growth in Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. On a 2-year basis, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.7% versus 2019.\nAdjusted gross profit increased 47% in the quarter to $1.83 billion. Adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points versus year ago to 53.8% of net sales. This performance reflected the impact of the significant pricing actions we put in place as well as delivery from our robust productivity program and merger synergies. Offsetting these drivers was the impact of both wide scale, accelerating [installation] and supply chain challenges, many of which compounded with the onset of Omicron in the fourth quarter, which is also a seasonally high demand period for us.\nAdjusted operating income in the quarter grew 6.1% to $910 million driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit and the benefits of productivity and merger synergies that favorably impacted SG&A as well as $70 million gain in the quarter from our strategic asset investment program. I will talk more about this program in a few moments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were broad-based inflation in outbound logistics and labor as well as higher marketing investments.\nOn a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus year ago. And on a 2-year basis, adjusted operating income increased 11.9% versus 2019. Adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 26.8% of net sales in the quarter, primarily due to the lag between the timing of inflation and pricing.\nAdjusted net income in the quarter advanced 15.5% to $640 million versus a year ago, primarily driven by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew 15.5% to $0.45 compared to $0.39 in the year ago period.\nBefore turning to 2021 full year results, I would like to spend a moment discussing the inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption we have referenced this morning. During the fourth quarter, inflation accelerated considerably. It increased across nearly all key inputs, leading to a double-digit inflation rate across cost of goods sold and SG&A combined, which is significantly higher than we experienced in the third quarter. As we look to 2022, we expect this level of inflation to continue for much of the year, with some moderation expected in the fourth quarter.\nAs Bob explained earlier, similar to others in the industry, we have faced a number of supply chain challenges. However, in quarter 4, it was our Coffee Systems business in which short-term profitability was most pressured by the convergence of demand and supply events. Consistently, strong consumer demand for K-Cup pods exceeded our manufacturing output, which was limited due to labor shortages and absenteeism driven by Omicron and a delay of our [Spartanburg] facility ramp-up also due to the impact of COVID on our European equipment supplier.\nAs a result, we missed [part] revenue opportunities, incurred incremental logistics costs as we expedited the available supply to partners, incurred substantial customer fines when our customer service levels missed targets. It is important to highlight that embedded in our Coffee Systems pricing results are the customer fines related to service levels, which are included on the P&L as a deduction to pricing, which masked the positive net price realization the Coffee Systems achieved in the quarter.\nAs Bob also mentioned, we have taken action to maximize production within our existing network to improve customer sales levels and to meet the continued strong consumer demand. Working closely with our partners, we have been able to simplify variety and implement minimum order sizes. We have also used the supply challenges as an opportunity to rationalize certain SKUs in our owned and licensed brand portfolio. And we have shed some lower-profit partner business. Collectively, these actions are already enabling us to improve production output and rebuild inventory. Our KDP manufactured and, to a lesser degree, own aid licensed share that you will see in syndicated data will be negatively impacted by these actions. However, they will have little to no impact on our profitability.\nFinally, we continue to work with our equipment supplier on ramping up Spartanburg, but we have derisked our plant by increasing capacity at existing facilities and assuming no additional [top] capacity coming from Spartanburg until 2023. The actions we have taken to increase production in all other sites will enable us to supply the immediate demand until that time.\nLet me turn now to our full year results for 2021. Constant currency net sales grew 8.4% to $12.68 billion, driven by higher volume mix of 5.7% and favorable net price realization of 2.7%. More importantly, net sales growth was strong and balanced across each of our business segments. On a 2-year basis, KDP net sales advanced 13.9% versus 2019.\nAdjusted gross profit growth of 7.9% to $7.04 billion equated to a gross margin of 55.5% for the full year, a 70 basis points decline versus last year. This performance reflects a series of pricing actions implemented late in the year, combined with productivity and merger synergies. Offsetting these positives was a significant broad-based inflation and supply chain disruption previously discussed accelerated in the fourth quarter.\nAdjusted operating income grew 7.2% to $3.42 billion and adjusted operating margin declined 50 basis points. Given the industry challenges in 2021, finishing the year with operating margin down only 50 basis points speaks to the underlying strength of our business and the benefits that come with a strong top line growth. In addition to the gross margin performance, also benefiting operating income were strong productivity and merger synergies as well as the year-over-year benefit of our strategic asset investment program. This program, which we started in 2019 creates value from certain assets to enable the investment in strategic assets to drive accelerated growth. Earlier, I mentioned the impact of this program in the fourth quarter results. However, most relevant is the much smaller full year impact of only $28 million, which is significantly below the increase in marketing investment we made in 2021. We plan to continue to use this program in 2022 and beyond.\nAdjusted net income for the year advanced 14.7% versus a year ago to $2.28 billion, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate.\nFor the year, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14.3% to $1.60 compared to $1.40 in the year ago period. On a 2-year basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 31.2% versus 2019.\nFree cash flow for the full year continued to be strong at almost $2.6 billion, representing a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 113%. This strong free cash flow, combined with the cash proceeds of $576 million from the sale of our equity interest in BodyArmor, enabled us to reduce our outstanding bank debt by over $1.7 billion and structural payables by $11 million. We also ended the year with $567 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nDue to our growth in earnings and reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 2.9x at the end of 2021 which delivers on our merger commitment to achieve a management leverage ratio at or below 3x.\nAs Bob discussed earlier, in addition to the $576 million received from the sale of our BodyArmor equity interest, we also resolved our litigation against BodyArmor in January which resulted in additional proceeds of $350 million, driving the combined amount of these items to almost $1 billion in cash proceeds. With these additional proceeds, we now expect to have approximately $5 billion of discretionary cash over the next 3 years to drive inorganic value creation.\nLet me now move to our guidance for 2022. Earlier today, we affirmed our 2022 full year guidance for both net sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. Supporting this guidance, we expect the following: Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion.\nFinally, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, given the current environment, I want to share our perspective on how we expect 2022 to unfold over the course of the year. From a timing standpoint, we expect the peak of the supply chain challenges to occur in quarter 1, with our results improving through the remaining 3 quarters. Inflation is expected to pressure margins for much of the year, with some moderation late in 2022. Specifically, supply chain disruption worsened in the second half of last year and is expected to moderate as we lap it in the second half of 2022. Inflation spiked in the second half of last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and, as such, is expected to moderate as we lap it in the latter part of 2022.\nTotal KDP revenue growth is expected to improve sequentially throughout 2022.\nFrom a segment standpoint, it's worth noting that Coffee Systems is expected to start the year slowly as we rebuild inventory to meet strong consumer demand and improved service levels [while we're] comping net sales growth of 17.4% in quarter 1 2021. Included in our guidance is the 53rd week in Coffee Systems which will occur in the fourth quarter of the year.\nThe net of all of these points is that we expect our adjusted earnings per share performance to strength during the year, reaching the high single-digit range in the second half, which is in line with our long-term algorithm.\nWith that, let me hand it back to the operator for questions.",

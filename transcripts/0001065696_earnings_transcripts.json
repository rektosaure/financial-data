Thank you for attending today's LKQ Corporation's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ken and I will be your moderator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to pass the conference over to our host, Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Justin Jude, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning. as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor.\nSome of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Justin Jude.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. I am extremely proud of our performance this quarter, demonstrating both the resilience of our business and the impact of our strategic initiatives with some positive operational performance and onetime tax benefits, we have confidence in our full year outlook to raise our midpoint and narrow the range. While I understand that most of you are interested in the financials, it's important to emphasize that our strong performance is a direct result of the relentless dedication and commitment of our teams across the globe who have enabled us to execute and succeed against our strategic pillars.\nLet me make some quick general comments on our markets before diving into specifics. We are seeing ongoing macro challenges, including reduced consumer spending and lower demand for vehicle repairs. As recent headlines have shown, other automotive companies are facing similar issues. However, our team has remained focused on controlling the things that we can control. In most areas of our business, we have outperformed the market and we're able to pass through costs. We are in execution mode. And as I mentioned on our last earnings call, we are focused on a multiyear transformation centered around 4 strategic priorities of simplifying our portfolio and operations, expanding our lean operating model globally with a focus on margin improvement, investing and growing organically and pursuing a disciplined capital allocation strategy.\nTo that end, I would like to highlight certain notable achievements from this quarter. First, we completed the sale of our self-service segment to Pacific Avenue Capital Partners for $410 million. We were very pleased to see strong interest in business. As a result of this sale, we have not only simplified our business, but strengthened our balance sheet, which we believe is prudent to do in these uncertain economic times. The proceeds from the sale of self-service have been used to reduce debt. we are prioritizing maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating to navigate market challenges, especially in these uncertain times. During the quarter, we had no acquisitions but to be clear, our strategic review process is active and ongoing and in coordination with the finance committee of our Board of Directors. We expect to continue our efforts to simplify our portfolio and operations as markets and opportunities avail themselves.\nSecond, we continue to improve our lean operating model globally with a focus on margin improvement and are acting with urgency to correct inefficiencies. To that end, as we outlined earlier this year, we targeted an additional $75 million in cost savings for 2025. I'm pleased to share that we made meaningful progress since Q2 and achieved $35 million cost savings well on track to meet the $75 million target. These gains have come primarily through our European business transformation driven from the leadership refresh in Europe earlier this year. Another important milestone under this initiative is our rollout of a common operating platform across Europe. We are on track to go live in early 2026 within a major market, which will put approximately 30% of our European revenue on a common system. Our recent migrations in smaller markets this year have given us confidence in our ability to effectively manage a larger implementation.\nNotably, the second migration had no operational impact a direct result of the lessons learned from our earlier launch in the first half of the year. Having scale on a common platform will help us replace legacy systems that are at risk, but more importantly, enable us to get back to profitable growth and faster integrations that will drive higher returns on invested capital. Lastly, turning to capital allocation. Our approach remains disciplined. We continue to balance share repurchases and dividend payments as part of a thoughtful return of capital program while also ensuring we maintain a strong balance sheet. Now moving on to our segments. In North America, Repairable claims continued to experience downward pressure, though the rate of decline has moderated to approximately 6%. Service levels and inventory fill rates were maintained and not sacrificed during these separate challenges enabling results that exceeded the performance of repairable claims.\nRevenue decreased by 30 basis points per day, marking the smallest decline since Q1 of 2024 and outperforming repairable claims by nearly 600 basis points. Let me highlight a few other positive trends in the U.S. that we think should help improve repairable claims. At the end of Q2, a record of 46.5% of auto insurance policies were shopped in the past year and many of the top carriers filed for rated reductions boosting new business. These trends signal ongoing pricing pressure from carriers and should help insurance rates normalize. And our part offerings continue to help carriers immediately reduce costs to offset any lower premiums just as they did during the financial crisis. We are also seeing used car prices somewhat stabilized but with continuing volatility month-to-month, values haven't normalized yet. Our diversification into new products and services in North America is generating positive results.\nDuring the quarter, our Canadian hard parts business, Bumper to Bumper post organic growth improvement both sequentially and year-over-year in a market that is also facing a recession like economy. Additionally, our tech business, which provides technical repairs and calibrations performed well as several key accounts achieving double-digit growth in the quarter. In Europe, organic revenue declined by 4.7% on a per day basis, reflecting a tough operating environment characterized by political uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence. We also decided not to retain certain less profitable revenue. And despite these market dynamics and overall volume pressure, the European team was still able to deliver double-digit EBITDA margins of 10% in the quarter, a 60 bps improvement sequentially as they drive towards a leaner operating model and Rick will dive deeper into margins shortly. The improvements from our Europe operations integration, as discussed at our September 2024 Investor Day will not happen all at once.\nHowever, our teams and new leadership are aligned with my approach focused on agile execution to create significant value for our company and shareholders. The challenges in Europe affect the entire industry but LKQ excels in such environments, as shown by our success in North America. Having integrated businesses in tough settings before, I am confident we can achieve similar results in Europe. We made additional progress in the quarter with respect to our SKU rationalization of jets, the SKU rationalization initiative in Europe is intended to decrease complexity and streamline the distribution network in all markets. More than 80% of revenue in the product brands portfolio have been reviewed an increase from 70% in Q2. Completion of this review is required before further delisting actions can be considered to ensure a full understanding of both opportunities and risks are known. Since the end of 2024, 29,000 SKUs have been delisted -- these products had minimal or no sales and remaining applications are still supported by existing SKUs.\nAdditionally, we continue to build out our collision model in the U.K., similar to our model in North America. We have developed our U.K. collision model, particularly around crash parts and paint from a base of 0 into a GBP 200 million business. Today, the top 20 insurers in the U.K. have approved LKQ to supply new aftermarket crash parts to their respective body shop chains under our Global Platinum Plus private label brand. Currently, approximately 30% of the estimates received via the collision estimatics systems are being processed, and we expect this figure to grow following the introduction of the salvage model partnership with Synetic. At present, 9 of the top 10 insurers have preapproved the use of recycled parts. Finally, we are very excited about the results in our Specialty segment, which delivered a 9.4% increase in organic revenue, marking the first positive organic growth in 14 quarters. This turnaround reflects the success of our targeted initiatives to sharpen focus improved pricing and strengthen channel relationships.\nOn our last call, I made some fairly in-depth remarks from streamlining the team across our global footprint and the talent that we now have in place. With another quarter under our belt, we are beginning to see the benefits of this transformation. A culture of execution is radiating through the organization and everyone is accountable to deliver. We've come a long way, but there's still more to do. and I'm confident in the team's ability to execute, adapt and lead through cycles, supported by a clear strategy and a relentless focus on execution.\nRick, I'll now turn it over to you to walk through the financial segments results in more detail.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Justin and welcome to everyone joining us today. I want to begin by echoing Justin's remarks regarding our performance in the quarter and the significant progress we made on our multiyear transformation strategy to simplify the business by sharpening our focus on core segments. Executing on our strategic priorities has been challenging in a down market, but as you can see, we have the team that delivers on our commitments in any operating environment.\nBefore I go into specifics on the quarter, I want to quickly explain the impact the sale of self-service has had on our financial reporting. As mentioned in our 8-K, self-service is reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, which means that its operating results are presented separately as a single line item above net income for current and historical periods, and our balance sheet information has also been recast to separately disclose the assets and liabilities of self-service. The net impact on our prior guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share is approximately $0.15 per share for full year 2025. Under U.S. GAAP allocated costs commonly known as stranded costs are not reported in discontinued operations. These costs have been recast to the wholesale North America segment and totaled approximately $5 million per quarter or around 30 basis points to their segment EBITDA margin for all periods presented. Additionally, because we used the net proceeds to pay down existing revolver borrowings, interest costs totaling approximately $5 million per quarter has been allocated to discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nTo assist in understanding the impact on the historical income statement and segment results, we have included several additional schedules in the tables to the press release and earnings presentation that reflect the recast results by quarter on a comparable basis going back to the beginning of 2024. We have also restated our guidance to reflect the impact of discontinued operations. I will take you through those numbers in a bit. Now turning to Q3 results for continuing operations. As Justin said in his remarks, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. We reported total revenues of $3.5 billion, a 1.3% increase over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.69, a $0.02 decrease compared to Q3 2024. On an adjusted diluted earnings per share basis, we reported $0.84. As a reminder, this excludes the results of operations from self-service, which are now reported as discontinued operations. Self-services's operating results contributed approximately $0.03 to discontinued operations. Prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.86 after adjusting for discontinued operations. Taxes provided a benefit of approximately $0.06 per share compared to the prior year.\nWe updated our annual tax rate estimate and saw a reduction of approximately 50 basis points, primarily attributable to the shift in the geographic mix of income. Additionally, we benefited from several discrete items, which make up the majority of the year-over-year tax benefit. Execution on our balanced capital allocation strategy benefited earnings per share by $0.02 resulting from share repurchases and another $0.01 for interest. Foreign exchange rates added another $0.02 compared to the prior year. Free cash flow was strong during the quarter at $387 million, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to $573 million. We returned $118 million to shareholders including $40 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares and $78 million for our quarterly dividend. We remain focused on deploying capital in a way that maximizes shareholder value while supporting growth. In Wholesale North America, we were pleased with our top line performance given the soft demand we faced throughout 2025. We are confident we are increasing our market share, and we are cautiously optimistic our markets are stabilizing.\nHowever, our markets are competitive and our ability to pass along price increases at a level that maintains our margin percentage is constrained and expected to remain challenging in the near term. Wholesale North America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 14.0%, a 180 basis point decrease relative to last year. Gross margin contributed to approximately 70 basis points of the decline due to the dilutive effect of increasing prices to offset dollar for dollar higher input costs from tariffs and unfavorable customer mix effect as we continue to grow share with the MSOs. Overhead expenses were approximately 80 basis points higher as a percentage of revenue due to incentive compensation costs, professional fees and credit loss reserves compared to the prior year on flat revenues. In Europe, segment EBITDA margin was 10.0%, a 20 basis point decrease versus last year, but a 60 basis point improvement sequentially versus Q2. Gross margin improved by approximately 40 basis points, largely resulting from the portfolio actions taken in 2024. However, the organic revenue decline put pressure on overhead expense leverage resulting in the decrease to segment EBITDA margins.\nSpecialties EBITDA margin of 7.3% is consistent with the prior year as higher revenue on lower margin product lines led to negative mix effect on gross margin, but strong cost controls provided a positive leverage effect on overhead expenses. With organic revenue ticking up in the quarter, we are encouraged by these recent trends. Now turning to the balance sheet. We repaid approximately $262 million of debt in the quarter. As of September 30, we had total debt of $4.2 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.5x EBITDA. On October 1, with the pretax proceeds from the sale of self-service, we repaid an additional $390 million in debt, further improving our leverage ratio. We believe it's prudent in these uncertain times to maintain a strong balance sheet to deal with uncertainties and we remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. As of September 30, 2025, our current debt maturities were $537 million, an increase from the end of Q2 as the Canadian term loan is now due within 12 months.\nFor our normal practice, we actively manage our capital structure and we are working through our options with our lending group regarding the Canadian term loan due in the third quarter of 2026. We have no significant concerns regarding our ability to extend the maturity date. Excluding the borrowings that were repaid on October 1 with the proceeds from the sale of self-service, our effective interest rate was 5.1% at the end of Q3, slightly lower than Q2. Our variable rate debt of $1.5 billion at the end of September was further reduced by $390 million following the receipt of the proceeds of the sale of self-service on October 1 that were used for debt repayment.\nI will conclude with our thoughts on the updated guidance for 2025. When we updated guidance last quarter, we anticipated macroeconomic factors in both North America and Europe will continue to drive an uncertain environment. Despite these ongoing headwinds, our operational performance in Q3 was slightly ahead of our expectations. We have now revised our full year outlook based on Q3 results and the sale of self-service. Our revised outlook and assumptions are included on Slide 12. Let me start with earnings per share. Following our third quarter results and continued execution across the portfolio, we are narrowing our full year 2025 guidance to an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3 to $3.15. This updated outlook reflects removal of self-service, which was reclassified to discontinued operations and reflects the strength of our core business performance.\nNow let me walk you through midpoint to midpoint from the guidance we issued in Q2. In our prior guidance, our midpoint was $3.15. Adjusting for the sale of self-service, the midpoint of our previous guidance would have come down by $0.15 to $3 even. With the better-than-anticipated performance in Q3, we are increasing our midpoint to $3.07, so a $0.07 increase on a like-for-like basis. We also narrowed the range, putting our updated range of $3 even to $3.15. Please note that our Q4 2024 results included a onetime net benefit of approximately $0.08 per share within our wholesale North America segment attributable to a favorable legal settlement, partially offset by the impact from a brief cyber incident in Canada. Moving on. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of negative 200 basis points to negative 300 basis points, a narrowing of the range provided last quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $750 million, overcoming a roughly $75 million headwind from the sale of self-service.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to make an approximately $60 million payment for taxes on the sale of the business and an additional $15 million of lower cash flow from the loss of self-services Q4 segment EBITDA. We are mitigating the $75 million headwind by reducing our anticipated capital spend by approximately $50 million and making up the remaining $25 million through improved trade working capital. As noted last quarter, tariffs continue to be a headwind, and we expect that the year-end inventory balance will include a full inventory turn inclusive of tariffs.\nThank you for your time. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Justin for his closing remarks.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick. In summary, we delivered solid Q3 results. We beat on adjusted earnings per share, raised the midpoint of our full year guidance and narrowed the range. We generated strong free cash flow and maintained our disciplined capital allocation strategy. I said I was going to simplify the portfolio. And while it's still ongoing, we were able to divest our self-service segment to a solid buyer for a sale price that exceeded our expectations. North America posted a strong quarter, outperforming the market despite weak repairable claims environment. Under new leadership, the Europe team continues its progress with our integration objectives and delivered double-digit EBITDA in a low-demand market. And our Specialty segment posted robust revenue growth for the first time in over 3 years. And none of this would have been possible without our 46,000 team members who drive this performance on a daily basis, and I want to give them a huge thank you. We are all committed to continue to improve our results that will ultimately reward all our stakeholders now and over the long term.\nOperator, we are now ready to open up the call for questions."

My name is Lucy, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand over to your host, Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Justin Jude, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for earnings release this morning. as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release as well as a slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Justin Jude.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. As you all know, I have now been in the CEO role for a full year. The year has presented some macro challenges and some short-term operational obstacles but also opportunities for longer-term value creation. Alongside my leadership team, we have made some tough but necessary decisions to fundamentally reshape how we operate and put us back to a path of consistent value creation. The decisions made are aligned with our overarching strategy, a multiyear transformation to simplify our portfolio, sharpen our focus and position us as a high-performing company centered on our core business segments. .\nOur global team is laser-focused on growing our market share while driving productivity and efficiently managing our cost structure. At our September 2024 Investor Day, we set our strategic priorities, simplify our business portfolio and operations, expand our lean operating model globally with a focus on margin enhancement, invest and grow organically and pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy. And so as we move forward, we are going to share how we are doing against each of these a scorecard, if you will, that makes it clear for the investment community to see how we are doing. I can't sugarcoat that today, the results are yet to show this progress and the macro headwinds necessitated our revised guidance. We are not where we need to be, and so we are going to push harder and move faster.\nTo that end, we are focused on two immediate things. One, additional cost-cutting measures primarily in Europe but also in North America with a goal of cutting another $75 million in costs; two, a heightened emphasis on the strategic review of our business units in operations that may result in the sale of assets that further accelerate our simplification strategy and capital allocation priorities. We are seeing a turn in the market for strategic activity with credit markets opening. Momentum behind midsized transactions and private equity actively seeking to deploy capital. While this will not be a linear process, I remain confident that we are on track to realize the full benefits of this strategy by 2027, as outlined at our September 2024 Investor Day.\nIt is worth noting that we are doing these things at a time when there are broader challenges in the overall auto industry and macroeconomic environment. It is a dynamic and fluid environment. Given amongst other factors, the rising input costs and the uncertainties around tariffs are creating confusion. We are not alone in the industry in facing these challenges, but you can either complain and make excuses or focus on your business and operating model to deliver the best possible results.\nOur team has chosen to focus on executing our plan, controlling the things we can, such as being efficient in managing our costs and looking for opportunities to take advantage of the current dislocations and disruptions in our core markets to gain market share and expand margins. We know in a challenging earnings environment, cost discipline is paramount, which is why we've taken actions to remove $125 million of costs in the past 12 months without compromising our ability to execute and service our customers. This is just a first step. And as I mentioned, we are going to continue to scrutinize our cost structure and find additional ways to enhance our margins.\nNext, I will discuss our business segments, North America first. North America's organic revenue fell by 2.2% per day, which is less of a decline than the last 5 quarters and an outperformance of repairable claims by over 650 bps, well above our historical 450 bps outperformance. Importantly, our aftermarket collision parts business witnessed a slight growth in the quarter. We are still seeing consistent demand across our hard parts business in Canada and margin enhancement as we convert from 3-step to 2-step.\nLastly, as an update to the issue of repairable claims resulting from declining used car pricing and rising insurance premiums, we previously said that the comps will start to ease as we progress into 2025. However, the June numbers were weaker than anticipated, and at this juncture, we think it is prudent to assume minimal market recovery in the back half of the year.\nMoving on to Europe. Europe's organic revenue decreased 4.9% or 3.8% on a per day basis, primarily driven by difficult economic conditions, increased competition in certain markets and some temporary headwinds due to operational challenges. We expect the economic conditions to continue throughout the balance of the year, along with the competitive pressures, which has led to price concessions. As an example, in the U.K., we've renegotiated several dozen national account agreements and resigned all but one validating the strong value proposition we offer to our customers.\nRegarding the operational challenges impacting revenue in a nutshell, we unintentionally created negative customer experiences and ultimately top line erosion. We have resolved these service issues and are in the process of regaining the customers' confidence and ultimately our share of wallet back.\nOne thing I would like to emphasize here is that Europe represents a significant opportunity for us. As I mentioned in the past, we need the right leaders in place to truly drive the change and achieve the benefits of scale that Europe represents. After recently making significant leadership changes, we now believe we have the right people. This revamped team is now focused on process and performance, both of which been lagged in certain areas of our European business. This lack of focus from previous leaders played a role in the underperformance in the quarter, and it will take some time to manage these legacy issues. However, we are confident that we are on track with the 3-year targets presented at our September 2024 Investor Day.\nI was in Europe the last week of June to meet with our management teams, and we will be focused on ensuring we are moving quickly to implement our strategy in that market. Europe is a competitive marketplace, and our focus is on key geographies where we have the ability to be a top player. We continue to make progress on our SKU rationalization goals. Our SKU rationalization project in Europe aims to reduce complexity and simplify our distribution network across all markets. We have reviewed over 70% of our product brands and reduced stocking by an additional 13,000 SKUs. Our private label penetration was flat sequentially, but up 20 bps year-to-date, keeping us on track to hit our 2027 target of 27%.\nIn addition to our SKU rationalization, we are streamlining our operations and reducing costs through back office and systems rationalization programs as well as greater utilization of our global competency centers. Moreover, we believe we're now positioned to expand our market share, and we feel confident we can continue as the leading European player. We started executing on this goal as we recently announced our partnership with Cinetic Limited which is a critical building block in the development of LKQ Europe salvage channel, a market that will benefit from the full service salvage intellectual capital in North America.\nMoving on to specialty. Specialty has turned a corner and is seeing improved results. Specialties organic revenue was largely flat year-over-year, which is the best quarterly year-over-year revenue performance since the fourth quarter of 2021. We are cautiously optimistic this segment is starting to show green shoots as our July revenue has continued to show positive trends we saw in June.\nLastly, Self Service. Self Services organic revenue was soft in the quarter from lower part volumes but still managed to deliver a 10% EBITDA margin. Disciplined vehicle procurement, combined with overhead cost controls continue to help drive profitable quarterly results in this segment.\nI want to stress that people are our greatest assets, ensuring we have the most talented and effective team is critical to our success. As a result, we have created an executive position focused on global talent development. We think this will be an important role, and we are excited about how it will support our overall business around the globe.\nA few facts that I think are important to share on talent. Since I took over the CEO role last July, we have taken difficult bold and necessary steps to reshape our leadership team. Over 25% of the roles at the VP level and above have been refreshed with new talent or redefined responsibilities. This level of transformation reflects our commitment to building a high-performing agile organization. We're focused on getting the right people on the bus and just as importantly, ensuring they're in the right seats. These changes, while not without challenges, are foundational to driving sustainable growth and consistent performance, which yield long-term value creation for shareholders.\nEqually important is the strength of our talent pipeline. Over 50% of it now comes from external hires with a high focus on our European operations to lead us through business transformation. This infusion of fresh perspectives and different experiences is accelerating innovation, bringing a clear lens on growing the business, finding efficiencies and positioning us for the future. We're not just evolving. We're focused on fixing, repairing and building momentum.\nI'm going to hand it over to Rick now, but I want to emphasize the following. We have size, scale in an unmatched distribution network. We know the current results are yet to reflect the value we are creating, and we share your frustration. But we are solidifying our foundation and ensuring when the cycle turns in this sector that we will be in the strongest position to capitalize on it to deliver results for our customers, partners and importantly, our shareholders. That is our mission, and we are hellbent on accomplishing it.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. I want to begin by reinforcing Justin's remarks on our continued commitment to execute on our multiyear transformation strategy that includes simplifying the business and reshaping our focus on core segments. We are and will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of these goals.\nNow turning to Q2 results. As Justin said in his remarks, our results are yet to reflect all of these efforts and Q2 results were below our expectations. While our initiatives are underway, revenue declines overall have created margin pressure driving down our earnings and free cash flow.\nWe reported total revenues of $3.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $0.75, a $0.05 increase compared to Q2 2024. On an adjusted diluted earnings per share basis, we reported $0.87, a decrease of $0.11 per share versus prior year primarily due to lower operating results. On a positive note, execution on our balanced capital allocation strategy benefited earnings per share by $0.03 from share repurchases and another $0.01 for interest. FX rates added another $0.03.\nFree cash flow during the quarter was $243 million despite a nearly $35 million headwind from tariffs, bringing the year-to-date cash flows to $186 million. We anticipate generating positive free cash flow in the next 2 quarters, but tariffs will present a working capital challenge in the back half of the year that I will discuss shortly.\nWe returned $117 million to shareholders, including $39 million to repurchase 1 million shares and $78 million for our quarterly dividend. We remain focused on deploying capital in a way that maximizes shareholder value while supporting growth.\nIn North America, we were pleased with our top line performance given the market pressure as we work through the continued decline in repairable claims. We are confident we are increasing our market share in a declining market. However, increasing competition and market dynamics contributed to a 100 basis point decline in gross margins. North America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 15.8%, a 150 basis point decrease relative to last year, but roughly 10 basis points better than Q1. The decline in gross margins and leverage effects from lower revenue on overheads contributed to the decline in EBITDA margins.\nIn Europe, segment EBITDA was 9.4%, a 120 basis point decrease from last year. If you will recall, in last year's Q2 call, I discussed a reduction in labor-related accruals previously recorded after a successful conclusion to the union negotiations in Germany. This benefited the prior year by roughly 70 basis points. Excluding this nonrecurring prior year benefit, EBITDA margins declined by 50 basis points.\nWe were pleased to see the year-over-year gross margin improvement resulting from procurement initiatives and ongoing productivity measures that outpaced inflation. However, the organic revenue decline put pressure on overhead expense leverage, resulting in the decrease to segment EBITDA margins. Specialties EBITDA margin of 8.5% is 40 basis points below the prior year due to a slight uptick in overhead costs related to inflationary cost increases with organic revenue being largely flat year-over-year, and positive in June and thus far in July, we are encouraged by these recent trends heading into the back half of the year. Self Service reported EBITDA margin of 10%, consistent with the prior year.\nTurning now to the balance sheet. We repaid approximately $111 million of debt in the quarter. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.5 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.6x EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment-grade ratings. As of June 30, 2025, our current debt maturities were $34 million, a reduction from the $558 million on March 31, 2025, as we extended the maturity date of the $500 million U.S. term loan by 1 year to Q1 2027.\nAs normal practice, we actively manage our capital structure, and we are working through our options with our lending group regarding the Canadian term loan due in the third quarter of 2026. We think in a high interest rate environment, ensuring our cost of capital is reasonable and managing the timing of our maturities is an important piece of prudent financial management. Our effective interest rate was 5.2% at the end of Q2, consistent with Q1. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps, which effectively provides a fixed rate on approximately 75% of our debt.\nGiven the confluence of macroeconomic factors in both North America and Europe, coupled with the results this quarter, we are lowering our full year outlook. In North America, we are anticipating a delayed recovery in repairable claims, ongoing tariff disruptions and competitive market dynamics. In Europe, persistent economic softness, geopolitical unrest, and ongoing U.S. trade negotiations are all drivers of an uncertain environment. To provide more detail, June's repairable claim numbers were down the most of all 3 months in the quarter despite our anticipated recovery. Based on current industry data and recent trends, we no longer expect these declines to rebound in 2025.\nAuto insurance prices are still rising and are expected to increase an average of 7.5% this year. According to a recent survey, nearly 1 in 4 people have downgraded or dropped their auto insurance to free up cash. To help further depict the economic factors driving the current market dynamics around repairable claims, we included a slide in the appendix on Page 17 with data derived from our proprietary analysis. The ever-changing tariff landscape further erodes consumer confidence and also complicates the views toward a more linear recovery. While we have been pricing in the impact from tariffs, our market remains competitive, and it may be difficult to maintain margins at the same levels in the short term.\nIn Europe, with the persistent softness in many of our markets and increased geopolitical unrest, we are no longer anticipating market improvements. To mitigate the lower revenue expectations, we have taken corrective action including leadership changes and productivity initiatives and are targeting additional cost removal in the back half of the year. However, these actions will not be enough to offset the full year impact of lower revenue.\nTurning back to 2025. Our revised outlook and assumptions are included on Slide 13. We expect reported organic parts and services revenue in the range of negative 150 basis points to negative 350 basis points. As a result of the revenue headwinds, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3 to $3.30, a decrease of $0.40 from the midpoint from the previous guidance. Approximately half of the decrease is from our North American segment, 40% from Europe and the remainder is largely from higher interest expense.\nFree cash flow will be impacted by the anticipated decrease in earnings and the impact of tariffs on working capital that will be on the balance sheet at year-end. To partially mitigate these headwinds, we are reducing our anticipated capital spend by approximately $50 million. We will continue to diligently manage our trade working capital in order to mitigate the lower earnings and tariff impact to drive EBITDA conversion to the extent possible. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of approximately $600 million to $750 million. Thank you for your time. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Justin for his closing remarks.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick. As stated at the outset, we have made some tough but necessary decisions to fundamentally reshape how we operate and put us back on the path toward consistent value creation. We need to set ourselves up for success and be able to deliver on what we say we are going to do. We are implementing our strategic plan and we are holding ourselves accountable to deliver that plan.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate our key strategic priorities: simplify our business portfolio and operations, expand our lean operating model globally with a focus on margin enhancement, invest and grow organically and pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy. I put us on the accelerator to deliver these strategic initiatives and create value for our shareholders. We expect to see the results, and we know you do too. With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We have reviewed over 60% of our product brands and reduced stocking by an additional 17000 Skus. Additionally, our private label penetration increased by 20 basis points.\n\nAs Andy and I mentioned at the Investor Day, the integration of Europe is mission critical and accelerating that effort is imperative given it has not progressed at the cadence we promised in the past.\n\nIn order to drive change management, we need the right leaders in place to truly achieve the benefits of the scale of one LKQ Europe represents.\n\nSince taking the helm in Europe, Andy alongside Rick and I have replaced a fair number of the previous leadership team and have onboard and individuals that are aligned with the operational excellence and lean management initiatives necessary to optimize our European operations are focuses on people process and performance.\n\nRegarding specialty our organic revenue declined by four 9% on a per day basis, which is a sequential improvement compared to Q4 of 2024.\n\nAt the start of 2025, there was optimism about specialty stabilizing later in the year, but consumer sentiment decreased significantly due to anticipated tariff pricing pressures.\n\nIntimate along with inflationary pressures will likely continue throughout the year.\n\nNow turning to tariffs.\n\nWhile the current headlines of the tariffs are broadly known to final decisions remain unclear. There are many dynamics of this tariff situation than those in the past we.\n\nWe have established an internal global tariff task force, which includes leaders from procurement operations finance risk management sales and marketing to help navigate and make decisions.\n\nIf everyone remembers the supply chain constraint following COVID-19, where inflation was driving our product cost and a supply demand imbalance create a huge increase in ocean freight team prove their agility of mitigating the impact and we came out financially stronger.\n\nSpecific to our tariff exposure of less than 15% of our U S businesses cost of goods are directly imported from outside the U S. With the majority of that product coming out of Taiwan.\n\nI'll kick us advantage over our aftermarket collision parts competitors lies in our supply of recycled products, which we anticipate we will see an increase in demand given their competitive pricing relative to new OE parts.\n\nWe expect the terrorist will raise part prices and increased used car values. Historically these increases have benefited the industry as used car values are expected to rise faster than new vehicle repair costs potentially leading to more cars being repaired and kept on the road longer.\n\nOur tariff task force is working on mitigating tariff impacts through potential cost concessions from vendor partnerships and identifying supply chain optimization and SG&A reductions.\n\nThe non discretionary nature of the North American business and the industry allows for needs based pricing power, enabling to pass on select price increases thus insulating the wholesale dynamic from the other parts suppliers in the market.\n\nNow before I turn the call to Rick to discuss our Q1 results I am pleased to announce that we will be publishing our 2020 for sustainability report at the end of May.\n\nSustainability continues to be at the heart of what we do especially in our North American and Europe salvage operations.\n\nThis is true today as it was when we started over 26 years ago.\n\nRick.\n\nThank you Justin and welcome to everyone. Joining us today, we are pleased with our start to 2025.\n\nCost actions taken in 2024, including exiting underperforming businesses and driving our lean operating model have positioned us well to offset the topline headwinds across each of our segments.\n\nOverall Q1 results were largely consistent with the trends we saw throughout the last several quarters.\n\nEurope continued its solid performance with a 60 basis point year over year improvement in segment EBITDA.\n\nIn North America, we were pleased with their performance given the anticipated top line pressure as we work through the decline in repairable claims.\n\nSelf service delivered another quarter of year over year improvement in both EBIT dollars and percentage.\n\nSpecialty results remained under pressure with soft demand in the RV and sema space, partially driven by softening consumer sentiment in light of the ongoing macroeconomic instability, including uncertainty around the effect of tariffs.\n\nNow turning to the first quarter consolidated results.\n\nOur first quarter performance was in line with our expectations.\n\nWe reported diluted earnings per share of 65.\n\nincreased compared to Q1 2024.\n\nOn an adjusted diluted earnings per share basis, we reported 79.\n\nA decrease of per share versus prior year.\n\nThe decrease in adjusted EPS is largely due to lower segment EBIT dollars predominantly from our wholesale North America segment.\n\nHigher legal and professional fees were also a headwind as we reached the cooperation agreement with Ancora and any capital in the first quarter.\n\nThe impacts from interest and FX rates, largely offset each other with interest being a slight positive and FX being a slight negative.\n\nOn a positive note lower share count, resulting from our disciplined share repurchase program drove of incremental adjusted EPS versus prior year.\n\nNow for segment results going to slide eight.\n\nNorth America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 15, 7%, a 60 basis point decrease relative to last year, primarily due to the organic revenue decline.\n\nThe decline in organic revenue was driven by a reduction in repairable claims and having one less selling day.\n\nPartially offset by targeted actions to increase market penetration.\n\nGross margin improved by 20 bps as a result of product mix and pricing initiatives.\n\nOverhead expenses declined by $16 million relative to prior year, including $24 million of decreased personnel costs due to unit select synergies and productivity initiatives.\n\nThese were partially offset by inflationary cost pressures related to facilities and vehicle expenses as well as higher legal and professional fees.\n\nOur leverage effect of the organic revenue decline largely drove the increase in opex as a percentage of revenue.\n\nWe expect headwinds on repairable claims to continue in 2025, but abate somewhat toward the back half of the year.\n\nExcluding any potential impacts from tariffs over the balance of the year, we still believe north Americas EBITDA margins will be in the low on a full year basis.\n\nLooking at Slide nine Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of nine 3%, a 60 basis point improvement over last year.\n\nThe year over year improvement was driven by higher gross margins the ongoing efforts to simplify the operations and portfolio as well as productivity efforts to offset inflationary pressures on overhead costs.\n\nOverhead costs were also negatively affected in the prior year due to union related negotiations.\n\nGiven the actions, we've taken to drive productivity and simplify the portfolio and absent any macroeconomic impact from the tariff situation. We continue to project EBITDA margin will be double digits on a full year basis in 2025.\n\nMoving to slide 10.\n\nSpecialties EBITDA margin of five 4% is 100 basis points below the prior year, primarily driven by a decline in organic revenue and resulting leverage effect on overhead costs.\n\nDemand softness in the light vehicle in RV product lines remain challenges for the business.\n\nEconomic instability stemming from tariffs has resulted in declines in consumer sentiment, which negatively impacts discretionary spending and some of the markets in which specialty operates.\n\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty and demand softness we expect segment EBITDA margin to be around the low end of the 7% to 8% range. We provided when we issued full year 2025 guidance.\n\nSelf service generated $20 million and segment EBITDA in Q1, an increase of $4 million and a 290 bps improvement as a percentage of revenue.\n\nDisciplined vehicle procurement combined with overhead cost controls helped to drive the fourth consecutive quarterly improvement in year over year profitability.\n\nShifting to cash flows and the balance sheet.\n\nFree cash flow during the quarter was a net outflow of $57 million. This performance was in line with our expectations due to the timing of our payables partially related to the investment in inventory in North America in anticipation of possible Q1 port strikes and higher interest payments for the 2031 Euro senior notes due to timing.\n\nWe anticipate generating positive free cash flow in the next three quarters will bring us in line with our full year guidance absent any significant tariff driven market turbulence.\n\nMoving to slide 11, we remained active in the market allocating $40 million in share repurchases for 1 million shares.\n\nWe also paid our quarterly dividend totaling $78 million.\n\nAs a continuation of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we did not make any acquisitions in the first quarter.\n\nWe borrowed approximately $170 million in the quarter as of March 31, we had total debt of $4 4 billion with a total leverage ratio of two five times EBITDA.\n\nThe leverage ratio is slightly higher than the prior quarter, we anticipated the increase as we built trade working capital in Q1, largely associated to the seasonal nature of our business and the increase in inventory purchases in Q4, and Q1 to get ahead of potential disruptions at the ports and from tariffs.\n\nWe remain committed to maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment grade rating as of March 31, 2025, our current maturities were $558 million .\n\nIncluding the $500 million term loan coming due in Q1 2026.\n\nAs normal practice, we actively manage our capital structure and we are working through our options with our lending group.\n\nWe have no significant concerns regarding our ability to extend the maturity date.\n\nOur effective interest rate was five 2% at the end of Q1 slightly down from Q4, we have $1 8 billion in variable rate debt of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps, which effectively provide fixed rate on approximately 75% of our debt.\n\nI will conclude with our thoughts on 2025 guidance as shown on slide 12.\n\nAlthough there are always uncertainties. We believe we can deliver on our guidance provided back in February excluding any material impacts from tariffs.\n\nThe discussions around tariffs may affect our markets directly and indirectly.\n\nThese have taken a variety of methods and addressing the remainder of the year.\n\nWe will wait to fully analyze the pending changes and update you during our Q2 call. When we believe the tariff situation becomes clear.\n\nThat being said our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends, excluding the potential impacts of tariffs and assumed scrap and precious metal prices hold near first quarter prices on.\n\nOn foreign exchange, our guidance is near March average rates, including the euro at $1 eight.\n\nThe pound Sterling at $1 28.\n\nAnd the Canadian dollar at 70.\n\nThe global tax rate is at 27.0%, which is consistent with our original guidance and prior year.\n\nIn our original guidance, we expected organic parts and services revenue growth between zero and 2% given our Q1 results were likely headed toward the lower end of that range.\n\nExcluding potential tariff impacts our adjusted diluted EPS remains in the range of $3 40 to $3 70.\n\nAnd our free cash flow remains in the range of $750 million to $900 million.\n\nWe will balance our trade working capital and capital expenditure needs to fund our strategic growth objectives for 2025 and beyond.\n\nFor your time I will now turn the call back to Justin for his closing comments.\n\nThanks, Rick for the financial commentary.\n\nBefore we open up for questions I would like to remind everyone. We remain committed to our long term key strategic priorities and our team is agile to navigate short term challenges first we had to grow above the market.\n\nNext simplify simplify our operations by ensuring lean thinking is in everything we do.\n\nAnd simplify our portfolio across our markets businesses and product lines.\n\nImproved free cash flow by growing profitably and strengthening our balance sheet .\n\nInvest in growth organically and via small highly synergistic tuck ins for the continuation on the moratorium of any large acquisitions.\n\nFocus on our capital allocation strategy around returning capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends in.\n\nIn Q1, we met most of our strategic goals with our 46000 employees are definitely managing volatile markets.\n\nWhether it's tariffs or some other challenge no matter, what our company may face I'm truly proud of how consistent our team emerged stronger and better prepared for the future.\n\nOperator, I'll now turn the call over for questions.\n\nThank you to ask a question. Please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now.\n\nChange your mind, Please press star followed by .\n\nAnd preparing to ask a question, please and showing your devices Amit Luckily.\n\nWe ask participants to limit their questions to Onemain and one follow up.\n\nBack into the queue. If you have another question."

My name is Lydia, and I will be your operator today.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI'll now hand you over to Joe Boutross to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Justin Jude, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-K in the coming days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Justin Jude.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. As many of you know, I took the CEO position after Nick's retirement in July of last year and it has been and continues to be an honor to lead the LKQ team and to maintain a culture rooted in humility. Our team leads by influence, not authority and ego. We take action, embrace change, confront fill your head on and always strive to make the right decisions for the company, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.\nIn 2024, we faced tough challenges. Despite financial setbacks, our team surpassed expectations and navigating the most difficult market dynamics I've seen in 30 years in the automotive industry. For that, I couldn't be prouder of our team members and the incredible culture we've built. Before I address the fourth quarter, I would like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished in 2024. With our commitment to operational excellence and a sound balance sheet we focused on the things we could control. And in those areas, we were very pleased with our performance. With our goal of returning cash to shareholders, we delivered $678 million of capital with $360 million in share repurchase $318 million coming from dividends. And our ongoing strategy to simplify the portfolio led to divesting 5 businesses, primarily in Europe, which represented $153 million of trailing 12-month revenue with little to no margin.\nMoody's and Fitch reiterated our stable and positive outlook in 2024. Our Board of Directors continued their active and ongoing Board refreshment to ensure we have the right mix of skills and experiences to provide effective oversight and guidance of the company's strategy. Our new Board members have extensive experience in business strategy and operations further enhancing the depth, knowledge and skill sets necessary to drive long-term value for our shareholders. The integration muscle of North America team was again validated in 2024 with the consolidation of FinishMaster into the LKQ network by closing 129 of their 151 locations. Not only did the North American team delivered the integration faster than expected, but with a higher level of synergies than originally planned.\nWe finalized our mega yard expansion project in Crystal River, Florida and in December, we began operating on this expanded acreage. We also purchased land and began the construction of 2 mega yards, one in Illinois and one in Washington. We expect these new yards to open in 2026. These mega yard expansions will allow us to further our growth on recycled parts while driving more productivity. Our European segment made several key leadership changes to support a more agile focus on change management. We developed a more consistent culture across our global footprint and combining the intellectual capital of our 2 nondiscretionary segments, North America and Europe.\nThis shared expertise will give us many benefits such as our overall procurement remanufacturing product development, hard parts growth in North America, opportunities that will come from electrification and a multitude of financial benefits, including vendor financing and a lower cost of capital. I will now shift to the quarter.\nLet's start with capital allocation. At recent trading levels, we believe repurchasing our shares is a good use of our capital. We were active in the quarter, repurchasing roughly 2 million shares for about $80 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.7 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. The Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share in October that was paid in November, totaling $78 million. On February 18, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share payable in March of 2025. Moving to our segments. The North American revenue decline of 8.5% per day was larger than what we reported in the first 3 quarters of 2024. But when you back out the nonrecurring benefit of the UAW strike in 2023, the form impacts across the U.S. in Q4, the North American decline in collision parts revenue was roughly 4% compared to a repairable claims decreasing almost 6% in the quarter.\nThe revenue declined, it was another period of outperformance for our North American operations on a relative basis. That said, we are seeing some positive trends as we enter 2025 including favorable inclement weather and ongoing dynamics in the auto insurance market that combined could benefit our North American collision business. The average cost of auto insurance in the U.S. increased over 20% in 2024, more than any other category of household expenses. We expect insurance costs to moderate in 2025. And historically, this will lead to insurance carriers looking to take costs out of their network and the value proposition of our alternative parts offering is one area they can quickly flex, which would be a favorable trend for APU.\nMoving on to Europe. Our organic revenue declined 20 bps on a per day basis for the quarter, which was essentially flat to Q3. Certain markets showed single-digit growth, while others declined in a similar range. I am particularly pleased with the organic growth in Germany, which has moved past the labor issues from 2023 and early 2024, and reported healthy sequential and year-over-year growth. Competition is again contributing to the challenging conditions in certain markets, consistent with the last quarter as some of the smaller players aggressively push price. Rick will cover the majority of margin-related details, but I wanted to highlight Europe segment EBITDA at 10.1% in the quarter. This performance is the highest Q4 segment EBITDA margin achieved in Europe. The third straight quarter with a double-digit margin, and the full year was the highest level of segment EBITDA dollars on record.\nWith leadership aligned with our margin objectives, we are confident in our ability to deliver a sustainable annual double-digit EBITDA margins in Europe. Tremendous performance and progress by the Europe team despite a challenging operating environment. Related to our SKU rationalization initiative in Europe, I am pleased to report that we hit our expectations of reviewing 50% of our product brands by year-end 2024, and we plan to complete the review of an additional 30% by year-end of 2025 and with completion by the end of 2026. We started with roughly 750,000 stocking SKUs across Europe and scope for this project. By the end of 2024, we had decreased our stocking of over 30,000 SKUs, and we expect to decrease another 40,000 more in 2025, ultimately hitting our goal of stocking 600,000 SKUs by the end of 2027.\nThis project will bring benefits on the procurement side, payables and more importantly, simplify our operations to allow for a more pan-European distribution network. As we will keep pushing for additional private label penetration, as we recognize that the European vehicle park will continue to age, and this has been further accelerated post the pandemic with a combination of supply chain constraints and the transition of EV being slower than anticipated. We currently have 22% penetration of private label parts with a long-term initiative to grow that number to 30% given the gross margin benefits that come from private label.\nWith this in mind, we do believe there are growth and margin enhancement opportunities in our category management portfolio and the increase in our private label offering is already included in our targeted $600,000 stocking SKU number. We plan to update you on our progress with these SKU targets on a quarterly basis. Specialty posted organic revenue down 7.3% on a per day basis, but was a sequential improvement from Q3. The RV Industry Association believes the RV market is poised for growth in 2025 with dealer inventories at higher levels, ongoing strong consumer interest and RV ownership and interest rates that are expected to ease. Additionally, total U.S. light vehicle sales increased 7.1% in Q4, with pickups in SUVs, the most important category for us, up 14.8% and 4.9%, respectively. So not out of the woods, we are starting to see some positive signs in our specialty segment as we entered 2025.\nLastly, on tariffs. The tariff news is extremely fluid with the current administration validated by the quick shift of halting to Mexico and Canada tariffs less than 48 hours after they were implemented. Our team is actively monitoring the various announcements and a potential impact on our business. As the tariff situation stabilizes and things unfold, we will keep the investment community apprised accordingly. As mentioned in the past, wholesale North America procures virtually 0 inventory from China, with most coming from Taiwan. And as you know, our salvage product is all domestic. Specialty is the only segment with exposure to China, approximately 15%, and their spend is highly diversified with some products being procured here in the U.S. I'll now turn the call over to Rick for a review of the financials and our 2025 guidance.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I dive into specifics on the fourth quarter, I would also like to cover some of our accomplishments throughout 2024. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, as Justin mentioned, we continue to focus on those things within our control. We accelerated the integration of FinishMaster completing that exercise in the first quarter and helping us to increase annualized Uni-Select synergies by the end of 2026 to $65 million. We initiated the 2024 restructuring plan with the objectives of exiting businesses and markets that do not align with our strategic objectives and executing on opportunities to streamline operations and our logistics models.\nIn Europe, that resulted in exiting certain operations and increasing the efficiency of our logistics footprint, resulting in a reduction in facilities and overhead costs. In North America, we focused on aligning our cost structure with demand by rationalizing overhead costs to most efficiently serve our customer base. While these actions were challenging, they were necessary to tackle and align with the strategic imperatives we discussed at Investor Day, including simplification of the business portfolio, improving our lean operating model globally and increasing our margins in order to maximize total shareholder returns.\nWe are confident the actions we have taken will drive our success in 2025 and beyond. Now on to the fourth quarter. Overall, Q4 results exceeded our expectations and guidance. Europe's performance was a highlight as the segment delivered a record fourth quarter EBITDA dollars and percentage despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. Self-service performed in line with expectations with another quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA dollars and percentage. North America improved its EBITDA margin by 50 basis points due to a onetime legal settlement, despite revenue losses from a brief cyber incident in Canada. Specialties results remained under pressure with soft demand.\nTurning now to the fourth quarter consolidated results. Despite challenges in North America and specialty and the stronger U.S. dollar affecting Europe, our fourth quarter performance exceeded expectations due to strong European results and some favorable nonrecurring items. For the full year, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.62 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.48, the latter of which was toward the higher end of the guidance range we discussed back in October, but a decrease of $0.35 per share compared to 2023. The $0.35 per share decline in adjusted EPS was primarily influenced by a combined $0.30 per share impact from interest and taxes with an additional $0.13 decrease attributed to commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.\nDespite the macroeconomic challenges and significant inflationary pressures on overhead and cost of goods sold, our efforts in simplification and strategic capital allocation have resulted in a positive contribution of $0.08 for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we reported diluted EPS of $0.60 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80, a $0.04 decrease from the prior year figure. As you may recall, our Q4 2023 results included some favorable onetime discrete tax items, which were not repeated in Q4 this year, resulting in a $0.09 year-over-year decrease from taxes. In addition, lower FX rates and unfavorable metals price movements contributed to a further $0.02 decline.\nOn the positive side, lower share count due to our ongoing share repurchase program, improved adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03. The remaining $0.04 year-over-year improvement reflected the strong performance by Europe and net favorable nonrecurring items in North America. Now for segment results. Going to Slide 7. North America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 16.8%, a 50 basis point increase relative to last year. For the full year, we reported a segment EBITDA margin of 16.6%, slightly above the expectations we discussed last quarter. due to a favorable nonrecurring legal settlement that was partially offset by our Canadian cyber incident. The decline in organic revenue, especially within our aftermarket business due to reduced repairable claim counts, adversely impacted margins during the quarter. This also included a related mix effect on gross margins as aftermarket collision revenue typically yields higher margins compared to our other wholesale lines.\nSalvage margins were also down in the quarter, reflecting unfavorable movement in revenue, vehicle cost trends and commodity prices in 2024. On the other hand, overhead expenses improved 270 basis points in North America, reflecting favorability from the onetime legal settlement and lower personnel costs, primarily related to lower incentive compensation. The Uni-Select synergies and productivity initiatives largely offset significant inflationary pressures and the leverage effect of the organic revenue decline. While we expect headwinds on repairable claims and salvage margins to continue in 2025 due to the factors I've mentioned, particularly in the first half of the year, we estimate that the North America's EBITDA margins will be in the low 16s consistent with 2024 after adjusting for the nonrecurring items.\nLooking at Slide 8. Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of 10.1% and a 180 basis point improvement over last year and its third quarter in a row with double-digit EBITDA margins. The year-over-year improvement consists of 110 basis points related to nonrecurring charges in the prior year, while the remaining 70 basis points relates to the ongoing efforts to simplify the operations and portfolio as well as productivity efforts that more than offset inflationary pressures. As I stated on our last call, we expected EBITDA margins in Europe for the full year to be in the mid- to high 9s, which is where we landed. From where we stand today and the actions we've taken to address productivity, we believe we can build upon our recent gains and expect to deliver improvements, with EBITDA margins expected to be double digits in 2025.\nMoving to Slide 9. Specialties EBITDA margin of 4.1% and 160 basis points below the prior year, primarily driven by a decline in organic revenue and resulting leverage effect on overhead costs. Demand softness in the light vehicle and RV product lines and competitive pricing pressures remain challenges for the business. For the full year, segment EBITDA margins were 6.8%, below our expectations, but largely related to the revenue softness. Early signs indicate some of our markets have stabilized. However, a rapid rebound in 2025 is unlikely due to inconsistent recovery. Thus, we expect segment EBITDA margins to improve to around 7% to 8% for the full year 2025. Self-service generated an 8.3% segment EBITDA margin in Q4, which is a 230 basis point improvement from last year.\nIn dollar terms, segment EBITDA increased by $4 million. Disciplined vehicle procurement, combined with overhead cost controls overcame unfavorable movements in scrap steel prices and helped to drive the third consecutive quarterly improvement in year-over-year profitability. Shifting to cash flows in the balance sheet. We produced $149 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $810 million. Though slightly below our expectations, we invested in North American inventory, anticipating possible Q1 port strikes and tariffs. We remain dedicated to delivering value to our shareholders, allocating over $150 million through $80 million in share repurchases and $78 million in dividends. As presented during our Investor Day, we committed to allocating at least 50% of our free cash flow towards returning value to our shareholders. We are pleased to announce that we exceeded this commitment in 2024. As you can see on Slide 10, for the full year, we deployed $678 million for share repurchases and dividends, representing over 80% of our free cash flow.\nWe also invested approximately $3 million in 2 tuck-in acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both in North America, including one in Canada and one in the U.S. For the year, we spent approximately $50 million on acquiring 10 highly accretive tuck-in businesses. We paid down approximately $62 million in outstanding debt in the quarter. As of December 31, we had total debt of $4.2 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA, an improvement from the prior quarter. We remain committed to maintaining a manageable debt level in our investment-grade rating. As of December 31, 2024, our current maturities were $38 million. but we have a $500 million term loan coming due in Q1 2026. As normal practice, we actively manage our capital structure and we are currently evaluating our options to determine the optimal solution to address our pending 2026 term loan maturity.\nOur effective interest rate was 5.3% at the end of Q4, slightly down from Q3 as a result of recently lowered benchmark rates. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with variable interest rate swaps, which effectively provides a fixed rate on over 75% of our debt. I will close with our thoughts on 2025 guidance, as shown on Slide 11. Our guidance is based on current market conditions, recent trends and assume scrap and precious metal prices hold near fourth quarter prices, and no material impact from tariffs. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent rates, including the euro at $1.04 and the pound sterling at $1.25 and the Canadian dollar at $0.70. The global tax rate is at 27.0%, which is comparable to our 2024 rate. We expect organic parts and services revenue growth between 0% and 2%. Please note we have one less selling day in 2025.\nIn North America, we expect revenue to be roughly flat on a per day basis. Given we don't expect an immediate rebound in repairable claims and won't realize the full benefit of some of the favorable trends Justin mentioned until later in the year. We believe Europe is poised to perform a bit better than they did from a revenue perspective in 2025 despite the ongoing challenging macroeconomic backdrop across the continent. For specialty, we expect low single digits for organic revenue growth given the macroeconomic indicators we are seeing. As a result of our revenue growth expectations, we are estimating adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.70.\nAs you can see on Slide 12, our EPS guidance anticipates headwinds from lower foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization as well as the onetime items discussed earlier partially offset by benefits from metals prices, interest and taxes. We are focusing our efforts on those items we can control and anticipate more than offsetting the net negative impact of those items through improved operating results which reflect the carryover benefit from the simplification and productivity measures we took in 2024, and the continued benefits from our disciplined focus on capital allocation. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $900 million. We will continue to balance our trade working capital and capital expenditure needs to fund our strategic growth objectives for 2025 and beyond. Thanks for your time. I will now turn the call back to Justin for his closing comments.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick, for the financial commentary. As we enter 2025, I want to reaffirm my strategic priorities for our global enterprise as we drive sustained long-term total shareholder returns. First, make sure we are growing above the market. Next, simplify. Simplify our operations by ensuring lean thinking is in everything we do to enhance our margins and simplify our portfolio across our markets and businesses to ensure we're the best owners. Improve free cash flow by growing profitably and strengthening our balance sheet, invest in growth organically and via small highly synergistic tuck-ins and with the continued moratorium on any large platform acquisitions, and focus our capital allocation strategy around returning capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nWith these priorities in place, coupled with our industry-leading teams, we are well positioned to navigate the challenges ahead and deliver strong operating results for all of our stakeholders. As always, I want to thank the 47,000-plus dedicated team members of LKQ for their commitment to advancing our business each day and driving our mission forward, no matter the obstacles. Time and time again, our team has shown these challenges are opportunities for growth for both themselves and the overall organization. With that, operator, we are ready to open the call for questions."

Welcome to LKQ Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kiki, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Joe Boutross, to begin. Joe, please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Justin Jude, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Justin Jude.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I am deeply honored and excited to be able to speak with you today as the CEO of LKQ, a company where I've spent the last 20 years working with dedicated colleagues to build a strong and vital business.\nBefore diving into the results for the quarter, I want to start by laying out my overarching priorities for our company and the plans we are executing to enhance performance and drive value for LKQ shareholders.\nLKQ is a strong company with market-leading businesses. We have been successful by leaning into our operational excellence strategy with a focus on profitable revenue growth, margin enhancement and cash flow generation. Under my leadership, we will prioritize these strategic pillars, which are an integral part of LKQ's culture. However, this doesn't mean we'll follow the exact same playbook. I expect my team to challenge the status quo, to be innovative, to set goals and communicate them so we hold each other accountable and to learn from mistakes.\nRick and I have years of experience operating successful businesses, of which 4, we're together running our North American wholesale segment. We will work together with our global team to run an efficient organization, one that is focused on growing market share while driving productivity and actively managing the cost structure.\nIn terms of capital allocation, our guiding principle is to direct our resources to the most value-enhancing opportunities. From our vantage point today, share repurchases will be a priority and a means of driving shareholder value. As you can see from our repurchase activity in the second quarter, we believe our shares are trading below their intrinsic value, and repurchases represent our best use of funds. We see attractive return metrics in our shares and through our capital allocation priorities, you should expect to see ongoing programmatic share repurchasing activity.\nWe have paused any large-scale acquisitions and raised the hurdle rate for improving synergistic tuck-in transactions. In fact, we have walked away from deals in recent months because the returns on investment did not meet our new criteria. Rationalizing the asset base has been a key element of our strategic framework. We have routinely examined our assets from individual locations up to lines of business to determine if the assets align with our future plans.\nAs part of this process, we identified certain lines of business that did not fit our strategic objectives, and we took action, divesting 14 businesses in the last 5 years, which represented over $600 million in low margin revenue. These transactions were done judiciously and following a disciplined process to achieve a favorable outcome, and we will continue to carefully evaluate whether we are the right owners for any of our businesses while we focus on our core strengths.\nFinally, cash flow generation will remain central to our business. Delivering strong cash flow allows us to invest in our future through capital projects and to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment-grade rating.\nI'll now provide some comments on our results, and then Rick will discuss our financials and guidance. Our second quarter results did not meet expectations on the top line. In the first quarter, we faced revenue headwinds from a decrease in repairable claims in North America, which was influenced by mild and dry winter weather conditions. In our Q1 commentary, we noted there would be a carryover effect in the second quarter as shops had lighter backlogs than normal going into April, and we acknowledge a further risk to revenue if repairable claims didn't rebound as we were projecting. As you can see from our second quarter results, the revenue trends moved in an unfavorable direction in North America as well as our other 3 segments. On a per day basis, organic parts and revenue was down 2.9% overall and was negative in each segment.\nDrilling down and starting with North America, organic revenue decreased by 5.3%, with the largest drop coming from aftermarket collision parts. Similar to Q1, repairable claims were down in the second quarter by 7%, proving to be a headwind. Although not material, access to aftermarket inventory following the Panama Canal disruption and delays with inbound deliveries also had a negative effect.\nAs we continue to see a reduction in repairable claims during Q2, we dug deeper into the market to further understand the drivers of this sequential decrease. While weather was a contributing factor to the reduction in Q1's repairable claims, as we mentioned on the last call, we further researched the impact of rising insurance costs and declining used car values on the consumer's decision to repair their vehicle. We found the combination of these economic factors, rising insurance premiums and repair costs relative to the declining used car prices have the largest aggregate effect.\nIn parallel, we also engaged a leading global consulting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the market and their findings lined up with our deep dive analysis. Based on these findings, we believe that most of these factors are temporary as weather conditions will fluctuate from year to year and economic conditions should normalize over time, allowing for insurance cost to moderate and used car prices to stabilize. We believe that an improvement in economic conditions will contribute to more cars being repaired.\nThe smaller impact of repairable claims is the ongoing effect of ADAS technology entering the car park, and we estimate that headwind to approximately be a 1% decrease in repairable claims per year. This is further supported by research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute, that states there is little evidence that partial automation systems are preventing collisions. However, the ADAS impact is not news to us, and it doesn't change our near and long-term outlook on the collision market as we believe there will continue to be offset [indiscernible] volumes with revenue opportunities from an increase in parts per estimate, the cost of more complex replacement parts, expanding our services of calibration and diagnostics and continued growth in APU. Rick will discuss in more detail how we are factoring these temporary effects into our guidance.\nWe have taken decisive cost actions to address the revenue shortfall. As we discussed on the last call, we accelerated the FinishMaster integration and announced a global restructuring program in the first quarter. With revenue remaining soft in Q2, we implemented a further cost reduction plan, and I am pleased with the progress the North American team has made. Just as the team proved throughout the COVID pandemic, we know how to drive cost out of the business and we exited Q2 with $60 million in run rate savings on the cost reductions. By making these actions quick, North America was able to generate a segment EBITDA margin above 17%, in line with our previous guidance. Our actions have been careful and deliberate and we believe we are well positioned to scale back up again as demand increases.\nSwitching to our Europe segment. Organic parts and services revenue increased by 0.3% on a reported basis but declined 1.3% on a per day basis due to volume reductions. There were several factors behind the negative trend with economic conditions being the most significant component. Modest economic growth and high inflation across many of our markets, including the U.K. and Germany, have impacted demand contributing to a year-over-year decline in overall volume. Like North America, we expect the unfavorable economic conditions to be a temporary headwind, but one that will likely persist through the second half of 2024.\nOther factors impacting revenue include the strike activity in Germany and heightened competition from small distributors. With the pressure coming from soft consumer demand, we are seeing some of our smaller competitors aggressively lowering prices. LKQ has been a price leader, but we are also very disciplined. By resisting price decreases, we lost some volume in the quarter. However, we do not think the short-term pricing behavior of these competitors is sustainable or irrational strategy, and we believe our compelling value proposition will continue to be a key competitive advantage.\nEurope has also taken actions to mitigate the revenue decline, including cost takeouts and productivity initiatives. Given local regulations, these efforts require more time to implement and thus, the benefits weren't fully realized in the second quarter. We expect to see greater cost savings as the year progresses and into 2025.\nAdditionally, the European team continues to advance our SKU rationalization project. The team has reviewed product groups representing about 1/3 of our revenue, and we believe there is an opportunity to reduce about 30% of the current SKUs in these groups. The SKUs would be delisted over a 3-year period starting in 2025, with the large majority coming in the first 2 years.\nAs I noted in my introductory remarks, we continue to review our portfolio and look for opportunities to divest noncore businesses. In Q2, we reached an agreement to sell our operations [indiscernible], and the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Combined with the previously announced sales of our Bosnian and Slovenian businesses, the ELIT Polska divestiture reflects our ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify our operations while improving our margin profile. This sale represents a good strategic fit as both LKQ and Mekonomen operated in Poland, but neither had the scale to compete effectively with the larger players in the market. The combined operation will be better positioned to compete and we will share any upside potential through our investment in Mekonomen.\nShifting to specialty. Organic revenue was down 2.1% for the quarter, roughly in line with the Q1 change. Softness in RV demand continues to be a headwind with uncertain economic conditions and high interest rates contributing to pressure on retail volume. We are seeing growth in some product lines, including marine. Consistent with the rest of the organization, specialty has taken cost actions to protect margins and is narrowing the gap in the year-over-year margin change.\nI want to mention some other noteworthy items for the past several months. In May, we received a favorable ruling from the Federal Circuit Court related to design patents. We believe the ruling is a win for the aftermarket industry and consumers who benefit from the value proposition offered by aftermarket products.\nIn June, the Verdi Trade Union and Employers Association in Germany entered into a new collective bargaining agreement. The new contract, which runs through April 2026, covers approximately 5,000 of our employees and puts an end to the strike activity we experienced over the last year. We remain dedicated to providing the industry's best service to our customers, and this agreement will improve our ability to deliver on this commitment. We have already seen an improvement in branch availability following the agreement and we expect to get back to pre-strike levels in the second half of this year.\nIn the quarter, we did a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, mostly by our BUMPER TO BUMPER business in Canada, where a tax law change provided an incentive to finish deals prior to June 30. As I noted earlier, we are deprioritizing M&A as we shift focus to share repurchase and other more accretive uses of capital. On that note, we returned over $200 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. This included the highest number of shares repurchased any quarter in the past 18 months, and we are continuing to repurchase shares in Q3. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share to be paid in August.\nFinally, from a governance standpoint, we regularly review the composition of our Board and ensure that we have members with the relevant experience and skills to support our mission. As part of this process, last week, we added Andy Clarke as a new board member. Andy is a former public company CFO and financial expert, and we are excited to add his expertise to the Board.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rick for a review of the financials and guidance.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. The Q2 results reflect lower than forecasted revenue for the second quarter as discussed by Justin. On a consolidated basis, gross margin also fell short of target as the lower aftermarket volumes in North America contributed to an overall mix decrease, and pricing in Europe did not fully cover input cost increases.\nWhile our second quarter performance did not meet expectations on the top line, we took swift and impactful cost actions and dug deep on the operational excellence principles that drove our growth and margin expansion over the last 5 years. Those actions, including accelerating the FinishMaster integration and implementing a restructuring plan helped improve our margins despite the lower revenue. We saw sequential EBITDA margin expansion of 140 basis points on a consolidated basis, including 100 basis points in North America, which brought us back up above 17%.\nWith the expectation of continuing headwinds impacting top line performance, we are updating our full year guidance. While each of the segment teams has detailed action plans in place to maximize their performance for the remainder of the year and rightsize the business for current volume trends, the ongoing revenue challenges across the business and persistent inflationary pressures in Europe expected in the back half of the year will result in lower revenue and earnings.\nTurning now to the second quarter consolidated results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.98 was $0.11 lower than the prior year figure. Movements in commodity prices, primarily precious metals, contributed to a $0.04 year-over-year decrease. The balance of the decrease was predominantly driven by operating results that did not offset the higher year-over-year interest expense resulting from the Uni-Select acquisition.\nOperating results were negatively impacted by decreases in organic revenue, including the lower North American aftermarket collision volumes and the resulting overall mix decrease and margin pressures stemming from the difficult macroeconomic conditions in Europe.\nNow for segment results. Going to Slide 11. North America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 17.3%, a 330 basis point decrease relative to last year. Last quarter, we projected that the full year margin would be around 17% due to the dilution impact from Uni-Select. The reported margin for the second quarter met our expectation as the cost actions offset the lower aftermarket revenue and the related mix effect on gross margins resulting from lower aftermarket collision revenue, which has a higher margin than our other wholesale product lines.\nRelative to the prior year, in addition to the Uni-Select dilution effect on gross margin, salvage margins were down, reflecting less favorable revenue and vehicle cost trends and lower catalytic converter prices in Q2 2024. Overhead expenses partially offset the gross margin reduction with lower costs as a percentage of revenue for personnel, including lower incentive compensation and lower freight. With the swift cost actions taken in response to the lower volumes being largely completed, we are reiterating our expectation of 17% EBITDA margin for the full year.\nLooking at Slide 12. Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of 10.6%, down 90 basis points from last year. Gross margin including restructuring costs declined by 130 basis points, driven largely by pricing challenges to offset input cost increases given the difficult economic conditions in Europe. As Justin noted, our smaller competitors were aggressive in lowering prices, which limited our ability to push price to cover higher input costs.\nOverhead expenses were favorable by 30 basis points. Personnel costs as a percentage of revenue were lower year-over-year as the reduction in labor-related accruals previously recorded for the ongoing union negotiations in Germany were partially offset by wage inflation in most markets. We have not fully covered the ongoing overhead and cost of goods sold input cost increases, and we have more work to do on pricing and productivity to boost the margin percentage. Many of these actions have been initiated and are in process, but the benefits will be more notable in the back half of the year and heading into 2025.\nWith the macroeconomic environment in Europe and timing of the cost action benefit, we expect EBITDA margin in Europe to be in the mid- to high [ 9s ] for the full year 2024. However, on a long-term basis, we continue to believe in our ability to deliver double-digit EBITDA margins in Europe.\nMoving to Slide 13. Specialties EBITDA margin of 8.9% declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by a decrease in gross margin. Demand softness in the RV product lines and competitive pricing pressures remain challenges for the business. We have been implementing changes to improve our net pricing and saw sequential quarterly improvement in gross margin in the last 2 quarters.\nOverhead expenses were roughly flat, but did include duplicative operating costs related to a distribution center consolidation project, which are nonrecurring. We believe the full year segment EBITDA margin will be slightly lower than the 8% we saw last year as we worked through the lingering gross margin pressures.\nAs you can see on Slide 14, self-service generated roughly 10% margin in Q2 compared to 4% last year. In dollar terms, segment EBITDA increased by $6 million despite a $7 million headwind from commodities. The efforts to manage vehicle costs helped mitigate the commodities impact, combined with overhead cost controls produced a year-over-year benefit. We have seen year-over-year improvement in segment EBITDA margins for the first half of 2024, and we were pleased to reach near double-digit margins this quarter.\nAs noted last quarter, we implemented a global restructuring program focused on enhancing profitability. The largest portion of the activity comes from the 2024 divestitures in the Europe segment, as discussed by Justin. These divestitures represented approximately $140 million in combined annual revenue. In addition, we incorporated restructuring actions in North America to reduce headcount, exit underperforming locations and other related actions. In total, we recorded $43 million in charges in the quarter, including $29 million in asset impairments and $6 million in inventory write-downs. Further charges are expected in future periods for severance, lease termination costs and other related expenses.\nShifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $133 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $320 million. In the second quarter, we deployed $125 million for share repurchases and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $80 million, returning value to our shareholders. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased 59 million shares for $2.6 billion. And as of June 30, there was $921 million remaining on the authorization.\nAs of June 30, we had total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment-grade rating.\nOur effective borrowing rate was 6.1% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points relative to Q1 2024. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 1 to 2 years, respectively.\nI will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2024 results. When we provided guidance on the Q1 call, we viewed the prior quarter's performance as largely temporary and expected a rebound in repairable claims in Q2. Given the sustained declines in overall volumes due to the lower repairable claims in North America and the volume decreases in Europe, given the difficult macroeconomic conditions, we are lowering our full year guidance. As mentioned previously, we view the volume declines as largely temporary, but now expect the impact to continue into the second half of the year.\nWhile we have taken actions to mitigate these effects through cost controls and margin actions, those will not be enough to offset the full impact of lower revenue expectations. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metal prices hold near June prices, and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes rates roughly in line with the second quarter. The global tax rate remains unchanged at 26.8%.\nOur full year guidance metrics on Slide 5 have been updated from the Q1 earnings call. We expect reported organic parts and services revenue in the range of negative 125 basis points to positive 25 basis points. At the negative 0.5% midpoint, this is a decrease of 400 basis points from the prior guidance. The softness in Q2 organic revenue growth, along with the expectation that we will not see a swift recovery in repairable claims in North America, drove the decision to lower the full year range. We believe the factors Justin described led to the revenue softness in North America and will remain a temporary headwind.\nIn Europe, while we anticipate some improvements in Germany following the successful conclusion of the union negotiations, the challenging macroeconomic backdrop leads us to believe that we will not see a quick rebound of volumes compared to their Q2 performance. As a result of the revenue headwinds, we expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.50 to $3.70, a decrease of $0.45 from the midpoint for the previous guidance.\nThe primary drivers of the decrease in midpoint are explained on Slide 6 and include: $0.37 from lowering operating results, including the reduction in revenue expectations and persistent inflationary pressures outpacing market pricing, partially offset by cost savings, productivity and restructuring initiatives; $0.08 from non-EBITDA related items, including investment performance, depreciation, interest and taxes; and $0.03 from lower FX rates and commodity prices. These are partially offset by a $0.03 benefit from share repurchases.\nWhile we continue to see variability in revenue trends, the team is doing an excellent job in addressing controllable factors to align to the current market environment and adjust for the short-term economic headwinds. The free cash flow target of 50% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion remains in place, but with the lower earnings expectations, we now expect free cash flow of approximately $850 million. Diligent balance sheet management should support achievement of the full year target while continuing to balance trade working capital needs heading into 2025.\nThank you for your time. I will now turn the call back to Justin for his closing comments.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick, for the financial commentary. Before we move to your questions, as we've communicated on recent calls, we are hosting our Investor Day on September 10 at the headquarters in Nashville and also via webcast. I hope you can all join us to discuss how we are charging our future. Rick and I will cover the overall LKQ strategy, and then we will focus on our 2 largest businesses: the wholesale North American and Europe segments. Our senior management from these segments will present business overviews and targets for growth and margin expansion.\nTo close out, in the first half, we faced obstacles that have tested our resolve and resilience. Through it all, I have seen the unwavering dedication and hard work that define our LKQ culture. I am inspired by the LKQ team's commitment to excellence and perseverance in the face of adversity. We are well positioned to navigate the road ahead, seize new opportunities and accelerate our work to create value for our shareholders.\nI'll now ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody listening to our earnings call for the first quarter of 2024. I will provide a few introductory remarks. Justin will then provide some highlights to our Q1 segment activities. Rick will provide a review of the financial details of the quarter and our guidance for the year, before I have a few closing remarks.\nI'm turning 66 in a few days. And as reported in late November, I will be retiring as CEO of LKQ on June 30. With that, this will be my 38th and final quarterly earnings call with all of you. It has been an absolute honor and privilege to serve LKQ and to interface with the investment community since joining the company in early 2015.\nI am incredibly proud of the organization, my team and all we've achieved over the years. We are a very different company today than the one I joined almost 10 years ago, one that is focused on operational excellence, balanced capital allocation, improved returns on capital and the development of our most important asset, our people.\nThe first quarter of 2024 proved to be a difficult environment for our business, and our results came in below expectations. While we did a reasonable job of managing the items under our control, we experienced soft overall market conditions, largely due to incredibly mild winter weather in North America, which reduced demand for collision parts and the continued soft demand for our specialty products. These market factors created pressure on revenue and overall operating leverage. We have already made adjustments to our cost structure in light of the current levels of demand.\nRelated to Europe and our business in Germany, there has been no material progress with our union negotiations in Germany. To help insulate our customers in that market, we have increased our temporary workforce to largely mitigate the revenue impact with the risk of ongoing strikes. And we've opened a second, albeit a much smaller distribution facility in Bielefeld, Germany, which is outside of Bavaria and not impacted by the union activity. Overall, we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year.\nNow on to the quarterly results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $3.7 billion, an increase of 10.6% compared to the $3.3 billion for the first quarter of 2023. For the first quarter of this year, parts and services organic revenue decreased 0.3% on a reported basis but increased 0.5% on a per day basis. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 0.8%, and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 11.6% year-over-year for a total parts and services revenue increase of 12.1%. Other revenue for the first quarter of 2024 fell 14.6%, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2023.\nDiluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 was $0.59 compared to $1.01 for the same period of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.82 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.04 for the same period of 2023.\nLastly, on April 22, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 a share of common stock payable on May 30, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2024.\nAnd now let me turn the call over to Justin.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone, to the call. As Nick mentioned, we are not pleased with the results delivered in the first quarter. However, I do think the team is focused and on the right track to confront some of the anomalies we faced, and I'll detail some of those action plans on this call.\nDuring our February call, Rick discussed our guidance for the year and indicated that we expected a softness in Q1, and our full year guidance was back-end loaded. Rick's comment was correct as we did experience a soft Q1, but it was beyond what, we, in the overall markets in which we operate, anticipated. That said, we are a continuous improvement company and we know how to drive improved operational and financial performance across our entire global footprint.\nWhile we got off to a slower-than-expected start for the year, our team has 3 more quarters to recover the shortfall, and we are confident we have actions in place to achieve the previously communicated EPS guidance. Rick will cover more of these in his prepared remarks.\nNow for a few high-level segment comments. In Wholesale North America, organic revenue decreased 3.3% due to a few key factors. First, we are coming off a strong comp of 14.4% growth in Q1 of last year. Second, there was an 8% decline in repairable claims. While this decline was largely driven by the extremely mild winter weather that Nick had mentioned, as the U.S. experienced the fifth warmest quarter on record, there were several other dynamics such as abnormal changes in auto insurance rates and used car pricing that we believe also had a negative impact.\nFinally, we experienced some challenges with aftermarket inventory entering the East Coast ports due to the ongoing Panama Canal disruption. We have yet to witness any disruption from the Baltimore tragedy, but we are closely monitoring the situation. Offsetting some of the aftermarket inventory delays, the salvage business posted positive growth in the quarter.\nAs the North American team faced the soft demand, [ John Lane ] and his team immediately shifted their focus to accelerating the integration of FinishMaster. This swift action resulted in the consolidation of 65 branches in Q1, bringing the total to 99, which represents 2/3 of the acquired locations.\nWe initially communicated the rationalization of the FinishMaster locations that would take us 3 years to reach this synergy level, and I'm impressed the team was able to accomplish this within the first 8 months following the acquisition closing. Today, 100% of FinishMaster sales and operations have been fully integrated.\nAnd through this process, the team uncovered additional synergies, allowing us to increase the previously disclosed estimate amount from $55 million to $65 million. This effort caused some short-term strain on the team, slightly impacting margins, but it was the right thing to do long term.\nAnd we continue to make strides with our Buffer to Buffer business in Canada by leveraging the European procurement size and scale. I want to again emphasize that Uni-Select was a unique opportunity that will enable us to widen the moat around our North American business and capitalize on revenue synergies that exist with paint and hard parts. I am confident and committed to this transaction, generating positive financial metrics for all stakeholders.\nIn Europe, organic revenue increased 2.7% on a reported basis and 4.4% on a per day basis, the best across our operating segments. Rick will cover the EBITDA results in his remarks, but let me cover several actions taking place to drive improved performance.\nI have made 4 different trips to our European operations in the first quarter to meet with the broader leadership team and look for improvement opportunities. I am pleased to see how focused the team is to drive integration and improve performance, all with a goal of enhancing our margins.\nAndy Hamilton and his team have deployed new detailed tracking tools that are actively being reviewed. These tools include pricing actions, productivity initiatives, a restructuring plan focused on taking costs out of the business, portfolio divestments and implementing a new technology within our distribution centers to lower the total cost of delivery to our customers.\nIn Germany, we expanded our distribution capacity by opening a second highly automated regional distribution center, which will reduce the strain on our primary distribution center in Bavaria, where the strikes have been occurring.\n[indiscernible] [ 2 ] divestitures and after careful and thorough analysis of our European business model, market trends and the overall economic environment, we made the strategic decision to divest our operations in [ Slovenia ] to a long-term value partner of LKQ. That sale closed last week. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to divest our operations in Bosnia, and we expect to complete that sale in Q3, subject to the receipt of regulatory approval.\nWe will continue to assess our business and our European market mix to determine if we are the best operator and whether we should fix or exit certain underperforming markets. Given the small size of these divestitures, we are not disclosing the terms of these 2 transactions.\nOne of the biggest projects we plan to update on a quarterly basis is our European SKU rationalization program. Today, little product commonality exists across the entire European platform, which prevents us from maximizing the leverage of our pan-European footprint. This project will reduce the total number of SKUs, reduce our complexity, simplify the offerings to our customers and drive several benefits, which include in fruit fulfillment rates, improved gross margins, reduced inventory levels and a decrease of our cost to serve our customers.\nWhen Andy kicked this project off in early Q1, we had over 900,000 SKUs across our European operations with less than a 7% overlap. Based on the first phase of this project, we believe we can achieve a 35% reduction in overall SKUs over the next 2 to 3 years. We look forward to Andy providing a deeper dive into this program on our September 10 Investor Day this year.\nNow turning to Specialty. Their organic revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter, tracking closely to plan and showing improvements month-to-month within the quarter. Certain product categories witnessed positive year-over-year growth.\nAutomotive products, which includes truck and off-road parts and accessories, increased 2.5% despite pickup truck and Jeep sales being down 5.6% and 11.4%, respectively. Also, Marine posted growth in the quarter. RV-related products decreased 8.5%, the smallest revenue decrease when compared to the 2023 quarterly growth rates.\nOur Specialty team has focused their efforts on targeting margin actions relating to price and cost controls, some of which we saw in the quarter with year-over-year improvements in SG&A.\nTurning to Self Service. They had an organic revenue decrease of 10.5% in the quarter, primarily driven by commodities and inclement weather in key markets, but margin performance exceeded our expectations.\nOn the corporate development front, during the quarter, we closed on 2 tuck-in acquisitions, including a heavy-duty truck parts supplier and an aftermarket parts distributor in Belgium. We also made an equity investment in a start-up recycler of lithium-ion EV batteries.\nNow let me turn it over to Rick for a detailed overview of our financials.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We released our full year guidance in February. We expected Q1 earnings to be challenged by the impact of weather conditions in January, very low catalytic converter prices and year-over-year decrease in selling days due to the timing of Easter. The actual results reflect lower than forecasted revenue, mostly due to a reduction in North America aftermarket product volumes, which were predominantly related to a significant decrease in the number of repairable claims.\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin fell short of target, as pricing did not fully cover input cost increases. Overhead expense actions were taken and others are currently in process, but the benefits will be seen in the balance of the year rather than Q1.\nDespite the Q1 results, we remain committed to our full year earnings guidance. We have 9 months to make up the shortfall and the core strength of the business are still there. We are digging deep on the operational excellence principles that drove our growth and margin expansion over the last 5 years, and are taking decisive actions. As Justin described, each of the segment teams have detailed action plans in place to deliver the full year numbers.\nTurning now to the first quarter consolidated results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.82 were $0.22 lower than the prior year figure. Operating results were the largest individual factor with a $0.12 reduction, mostly related to North America. This figure includes the anticipated Uni-Select headwind as the integration efforts were ongoing. We expect the Uni-Select impact to flip to accretion going forward in 2024 as the synergies Justin mentioned are realized.\nMovements in commodity prices, primarily precious metals, contributed a $0.06 year-over-year decrease. Other items, including investment performance and taxes drove a $4 decrease.\nNow for segment results. Going to Slide 9. North America posted segment EBITDA margin of 16.3%, a 420 basis point decrease relative to last year. During the last call, we projected the full year margin would be around 17% for the full year impact of the Uni-Select dilution. The reported margin was below the full year expectation due to leverage impact from the lower revenue in Q1.\nRelative to the prior year, in addition to the communicated anticipated Uni-Select dilution effect on gross margin, salvage margins were down, reflecting unfavorable revenue and vehicle cost trends compared to the prior year period and lower catalytic converter prices in Q1 2024. Overhead expenses partially offset the gross margin reduction with lower costs for freight, charitable contributions and incentive compensation.\nQ1 2023 also included a nonrecurring benefit from an eminent domain settlement that created a year-over-year negative variance. North America is executing action plans to recover the profitability miss in Q1, and we expect the full year EBITDA margin to be around 17%.\nLooking at Slide 10. Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of 8.7%, down 100 basis points from last year. Gross margin, excluding restructuring costs, improved by 60 basis points, but was offset by higher overhead costs, including personnel costs tied to wage inflation in markets such as Germany, the U.K. and the Benelux region.\nWhile we have grown gross margin, we have not covered the overhead cost increases, and we have work to do on pricing and productivity to mitigate the cost inflation. We still expect to achieve double-digit margins in Europe for the full year.\nMoving to Slide 11. Specialties EBITDA margin of 6.4% declined 150 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by a 170 basis point decrease in gross margin. Competitive pricing pressure remains a challenge for the business, and we are evaluating options and implementing changes to improve our net pricing. We believe the full year Specialty EBITDA margin will be flat to a slight increase as we work through the lingering gross margin pressures.\nAs you can see on Slide 12, Self Service generated an 11.7% EBITDA margin in Q1 2024 compared to 13.2% last year. In dollar terms, segment EBITDA decreased by $6 million. The impact from commodities represented a $16 million headwind. However, the efforts to manage vehicle costs help mitigate a portion of the commodities impact and overhead cost controls produced a year-over-year benefit.\nWe have not seen double-digit segment EBITDA margin in percentage or dollar terms since Q1 2023. So we are pleased to reach this level again this past quarter.\nWe implemented a global restructuring program in the first quarter focused on enhancing profitability. The largest portion of the activity will come from the European segment. And as Justin mentioned, will include exiting certain businesses or markets which do not align to our strategic objectives.\nInitially, this includes exiting businesses in Slovenia and Bosnia, which are relatively small with under $40 million in combined annual revenue and evaluations of other markets are ongoing. We recorded $27 million in charges in the quarter, including $17 million in asset impairments and $8 million in inventory write-downs. Other charges are expected in future periods for severance, lease termination costs and other shutdown related expenses.\nShifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $187 million of free cash flow during the quarter, and we remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $1 billion.\nAs of March 31, we had a total debt of $4.3 billion, with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA, and we remain committed to reducing our total leverage ratio below 2.0x.\nIn March, we successfully completed a EUR 750 million bond offering with a 7-year maturity and a fixed [ 4.125% ] interest rate. The offering was completed to pay off the existing EUR 500 million bonds that were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2024. We upsized the offering by EUR 250 million in response to very strong demand from fixed income investors, reflecting LKQ's strong credit profile and solid cash flows.\nThe additional proceeds were utilized to pay down a portion of our euro revolver debt. The larger offering allows to lock in capital at an attractive rate for an extended period and diversify our maturity profile. The bonds are publicly tradable and listed on NASDAQ. We do not have significant debt maturity until January 2026.\nOur effective borrowing rate was 6.0% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points relative to Q4 2023. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed, with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 1 to 2 years, respectively.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares for $30 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $81 million, further validating that as we reduce our debt levels, we are migrating to a more balanced capital allocation strategy.\nI will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2024 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends, and assumes that scrap and precious metal prices hold near [ March ] prices, and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven.\nOn foreign exchange, our guidance includes rates in line with the first quarter. The global tax rate remains unchanged at 26.8%.\nOur full year guidance metrics on Slide 4 remain mostly unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 2.5% to 4.5%, which is a 100 basis point decrease in the range. The softness in Q1 organic growth drove the decision to lower the full year range.\nWe believe that mild winter weather conditions were a major contributing factor to the revenue softness and will have some carryover effects into Q2, but otherwise will be a temporary headwind relative to repairable claims. However, if repairable claims in North America do not rebound to a more normalized level, we would expect to be closer to the low end of the full year range. We are closely monitoring monthly claims data, and the team is ready to take decisive cost actions if claims remain depressed.\nWe still expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20. With the revenue volatility, there is heightened risk to the profitability estimate, but we are confident in the action plans being implemented in all segments to address controllable factors such as our cost structure to keep us inside the previously issued range.\nThe free cash flow expectation of $1 billion and 50% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion remain in place. Improved profitability over the balance of the year and diligent balance sheet management should support achievement of the full year target. Thanks for your time this morning.\nBut before I turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments, on behalf of our LKQ team globally, I'd like to thank Nick for his leadership, vision and integrity during his tenure as our CEO. Nick, you left a tremendous mark on LKQ and have positioned us well for the next chapter of our evolution. We wish you in the growing Zarcone family, all the best.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThanks, Rick, for those very kind comments. When I took the seat as CEO in 2017, I believe it was my responsibility to be the primary advocate for our greatest asset, our people, and to place them at the center of LKQ's mission. I am incredibly thankful to all my past and current colleagues, who served each other in pursuit of being an employee-focused organization.\nCollectively, we made great progress over the years, which carried forward in the first quarter, when we were awarded Mental Health America's Bell seal for workplace mental health at the gold level, and we were again selected as a 5-star employer by WorkBuzz for our U.S., Indian, Mexican and Canadian businesses.\nIt is with tremendous pride and humility that I depart knowing that the entrepreneurial culture that was established in 1998, when the company was founded, lives on today. And that every day, our 49,000 global employees never lose sight of the passion needed to serve our customers and our communities. They are committed to not only grow the company, but themselves as individuals. The gratitude I have from my fellow employees is immeasurable, and I cannot think them enough for creating an incredible journey for me.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions."

My name is Jordan, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I'm now going to hand over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, LKQ Corporation. Joe, please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Justin Jude, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. As many of you know, in late November, we announced my intention to retire as CEO effective June 30, 2024, and that the Board unanimously selected Justin as my successor following an intensive planning process that had been initiated well over a year ago. In the interim, Justin is serving as our Global Chief Operating Officer, and I look forward to working with him and our segment teams to ensure the continuation of our operational excellence program that we started late in 2018. Nowhere has this program been more evident than in our Wholesale North America segment, which under Justin's direction has significantly expanded margins, improved cash flow, all while enhancing our leading market position.\nTime and again, Justin has proven himself as both a strong operating executive and an effective leader who definitively embodies LKQ's values. It is a pleasure having Justin on the call today in his well-deserved new role.\nI'm going to start by providing some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and the full year 2023 followed by Rick, who will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2024 guidance, and then Justin will provide some initial thoughts and commentary on our businesses, the path forward and an update on our Uni-Select integration.\nLet me start with what LKQ accomplished in the last year, a year where operational excellence remained at the forefront of our efforts as we look to drive organic revenue growth, productivity and excellent free cash flow. I am proud to say that the LKQ team delivered.\nHere are some of the 2023 accomplishments worth noting. LKQ delivered strong full year organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.7% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. In February, we announced the highly synergistic Uni-Select acquisition and closed the transaction on August 1. We used our free cash flow to begin paying down debt as we strive to reduce our total leverage ratio to 2.0x. We're well on our way with net debt paydowns of over $375 million since the transaction closing and the total leverage ratio at year-end was just 2.3x.\nWe returned about $300 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and increased the quarterly amount by 9% in October. We also continued our share repurchase program with a $38 million outlay during the year, of which $30 million was completed in the fourth quarter. And finally, we sustained the positive momentum in terms of cash flow generation with free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2023. This represents the fourth consecutive year at or above $1 billion and the 2023 results reflect a solid conversion ratio of 59% of adjusted EBITDA.\nNow on to the quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 billion, an increase of 16.6% as compared to $3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 2.8% on a reported basis and 3.4% on a per day basis. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 2.7% and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 13.1% year-over-year for a total parts and services revenue increase of 18.7%. Other revenue fell 16.4%, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022.\nLet's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Organic revenue for parts and services for our North America segment increased 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims were down 7.9% year-over-year.\nWe believe the significant outperformance is due to several factors, including an industry-wide increase in alternative part usage or APU, which was in part driven by the continued progress of the State Farm rollout. The remaining positive impact of the UAW strikes and lastly, LKQ continuing to take market share. The upward trend in our aftermarket volumes and the ongoing improvement in our order fill rates continued with fill rates reaching close to 95% in the fourth quarter, the highest level in 2023.\nAs the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, APU trended in our favor, particularly when looking at vehicles in our sweet spot. While total APU was about 36% in 2023, when looking at vehicles 4 to 6 old, it was approximately 40% and for vehicles more than 7 years old, it was 51.6%. Both results represent meaningful increases over the 2022 levels.\nThe aging car park will increase demand for the types of parts we sell into the collision repair industry. The salvage business had solid organic growth, largely driven by volume. Total loss rates increased a bit in 2023 to 20.8%. But as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth. Importantly, the increase in total loss rates is largely being driven by vehicles 10 years and older, which is a population of vehicles at the very tail end of our sweet spot.\nFor perspective, today, the average model year of vehicle being repaired in a Collision Bay is a 2017 model with the total loss rate for that cohort of vehicles being just 18.4% in 2023, that further supports our thesis that total loss rates will not materially impact our growth. Industry experts believe the total loss rate will edge down a bit in 2024. As we have always stated, fluctuations in total loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ. During the quarter, we realized a slight revenue uplift from the UAW strike which has now leveled off and no further benefit is expected.\nMoving to our European segment. Europe organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 3.9% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. All the regions produced solid organic growth in the quarter with a particularly strong performance in the Benelux and Eastern European markets as well as with our private label and salvage product lines.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our operations in Germany were again impacted by employee strikes at our large distribution center in Bavaria, while the ongoing discussions and negotiations between the Works Council and Employers Association continued. Throughout this process, our European team has worked diligently to mitigate the day-to-day impact of the strikes and their efforts have begun to offset some of the challenges that have impacted our German operations.\nAlthough the strikes continue, we have been able to temporarily add some short-term capacity to operate our business and service our customers. Additionally, to foster a resolution, we recently initiated an incremental and unique approach and proposed terms of an LKQ only offer to the Works Council. We have also commuted those terms to our employees and are cautiously optimistic that we are making positive progress towards a resolution. Rick will provide you with the financial impact shortly.\nNow let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 7%, which was under our expectations. Specialty again confronted headwinds specific to RV and towing products. Within the RV space, RV wholesale shipments of new units from the OEs to the dealers ended 2023 on a positive note with an increase of 8.1% in December. This was the second consecutive month of year-over-year growth.\nFull year shipments, however, were down 36.5%. The general sense in the industry is that the RV headwinds have bottomed out, but we are not yet out of the woods as the dealers are still reluctant to fully restock accessories until they see the demand for new units increase. Truck accessories were also under some pressure in the quarter due to the drop in new vehicle production specific to the pickup and jeep categories, while marine and off-road product lines generated positive growth.\nNow to our self-service segment. Organic revenue for 5.6% in the fourth quarter. Self-service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing as seen in the other revenue decline, which impacted our expectations. The soft precious metal prices have continued into 2024. And in the short term, we expect little relief from commodities as we have modeled accordingly.\nBriefly on the Red Sea crisis, as far as we can predict, there will be minimal impact on parts availability in our key segments. In Europe, our procurement team is seeing some disruption with the shipping lines having to divert their vessels via the Cape of Good Hope around South Africa, increasing lead times and freight costs. The freight cost is expected to soften once the Chinese New Year, 4 weeks from mid-January ends. As one would expect, if the crisis persists, then we will potentially witness an increase in freight costs. Our supply chain team is taking precautionary measures by adding additional orders to address the extra lead times, especially with our private label product.\nLastly, on October 25, 2023, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we completed the divestment of GSF Car Parts, formerly owned by Uni-Select. Since the GSF Car Parts business was held separately and never integrated into our business, we classified the business as discontinued operations upon acquisition.\nBefore I turn it over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2024, I am pleased to announce that on February 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock that will be payable on March 28 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2024.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I address the fourth quarter, I would like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished throughout 2023. We were optimistic about our prospects going into 2023 despite macroeconomic challenges, inflation and declining commodity prices. With our operational excellence focus and strong balance sheet, we concentrated on the things we could control. And in those areas, we were very pleased with our performance.\nWe encountered headwinds that set back the overall profitability, but we believe many of these are transitory and will be minimal in 2024. The nondiscretionary nature of the majority of our business and the resiliency of our industry allows us to perform well in almost any market environment.\nReferring to the walk on Slide 4, I want to highlight the key year-over-year variances in our full year results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.83, the latter of which was a $0.02 decrease relative to 2022. Our operational performance was a strong positive delivering $0.27 year-over-year improvement with exceptional growth in North America, partially offset by softness in precious metal prices and difficult market conditions impacting our specialty and self-service segments. Europe also contributed to the improvement with solid revenue growth and productivity benefits, helping to offset the effects of the German strikes and the value-added tax matter in Italy. We benefited by $0.10 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. We experienced year-over-year headwinds from market conditions, the most notable of which were $0.19 from the impact of metal prices as shown on Slide 28, and $0.13 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases, excluding Uni-Select costs.\nAcquisition and divestiture activities had a negative effect, including a $0.04 of dilution from the Uni-Select acquisition. Important to note, this result was $0.01 better than we anticipated in our Q4 guidance and $0.02 of reduced earnings related to the PGW divestiture in April 2022. Foreign exchange rates were favorable on average in 2023, which contributed to a $0.02 benefit. The tax provision represented a $0.06 benefit, driven mostly by favorable impacts from discrete items.\nWe have also included a fourth quarter EPS walk on Slide 5. The main variances are similar to the full year drivers but with income taxes representing the largest variance from 2022. The 2023 provision included favorable discrete items and a slight full year effective rate reduction, while 2022 reflected a negative provision effect from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items.\nTo expand on the operating performance for the quarter, I will provide additional detail on the segment results. Going to Slide 12. Wholesale North America continued its strong performance with a segment EBITDA margin of 16.3%. Q4 was the first full quarter with Uni-Select and as communicated, the transaction was dilutive to the segment margin by 220 basis points. Without Uni-Select, North American margins would have been comparable to Q4 2022 and would have delivered a record full year EBITDA margin of 19.7%.\nQ4 2023 benefited from some incremental sales in October and November attributed to effects of the UAW strike, and we don't expect further upside in 2024. The Uni-Select integration is progressing ahead of schedule. And with FinishMaster and LKQ locations merging, it's becoming increasingly difficult to determine a stand-alone Uni-Select impact. Therefore, we will not provide specific Uni-Select impacts on the North American results going forward, but we'll instead report just on synergy achievement. We expect the 2024 North American full year EBITDA margin, including Uni-Select to be around 17%.\nAs shown on Slide 13, Europe reported segment EBITDA margin of 8.3%, down 170 basis points from the prior year period. There were several unusual items, which had a negative effect of 110 basis points on the results. First, the strikes at our primary distribution center in Germany continued in Q4, and we estimated the loss revenue and negative effect on the segment EBITDA margin of 50 basis points.\nSecond, we booked a nonrecurring compensation charge for $6 million which impacted the margin by 40 basis points. Finally, we recorded a reserve for a value-added tax matter, which lowered the margin by 20 basis points. The remaining margin variance is attributable to inflationary cost effects in SG&A expenses, primarily in personnel costs.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we project a return to a double-digit margin as we work past the strikes and the transitory effects that dropped the segment below a 10% margin in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 14. Specialties EBITDA margin of 5.7% decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 290 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors. In addition to unfavorable product mix as the lower-margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions than the RV market.\nI am pleased to report our SG&A expenses were favorable by 210 basis points mostly related to personnel and primarily coming from management restructuring efforts in the last 12 months to align the cost structure with revenue trends and lower benefits and insurance costs.\n2023 was a tough year for specialty. But by focusing on controllable costs, the team was able to mitigate some of the negative leverage effect on margin caused by the revenue decline. Going into 2024, this segment still faces challenging conditions, and we expect low single-digit organic revenue growth. However, we are optimistic about our ability to improve EBITDA margins by 10 to 30 basis points through productivity.\nAs you can see on Slide 15, self-service profitability improved sequentially to EBITDA margins of 6.0% this quarter from a loss of 0.6% in the third quarter and increased relative to the 5.2% reported in Q4 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results of $6 million with lower precious metal prices representing a $13 million reduction in EBITDA and lag effects from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a $7 million improvement.\nOther revenue decreased by 25% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points. As part of the actions taken earlier in 2023, our average car cost decreased by 6% and 18% in Q4 relative to Q3 and Q2, respectively, which provided some margin relief and contributed to the year-over-year improvement. We are pleased with the return to profitability in the fourth quarter and expect to improve our 2024 segment EBITDA in dollar terms compared to 2023.\nShifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $87 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.0 billion. As expected, free cash flow was relatively light in the quarter as we had $96 million of interest payments including the first payment on the U.S. bonds issued in May and $125 million of capital expenditures. And $358 million of CapEx for the year, we exceeded our prior guidance by $58 million as we took advantage of our strong cash flow and liquidity position to make strategic purchases, some of which were pulled forward from our 2024 plan.\nFor the year, the cash conversion ratio is 59% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60%. With the future headwinds related to interest expense and capital spending requirements, we are widening our cash conversion target range to 50% to 60%. While we have opportunities to drive trade working capital lower, such as with the supply chain finance program, these opportunities are not as abundant as they were years ago when we began our operational excellence journey.\nThe team has done terrific work to lower working capital levels over the last 5 years and the effects we're seeing in the strong free cash flow figures. We believe we can continue to generate free cash flow in the range of $1 billion on a recurring basis by converting earnings growth into cash flow, being efficient in our deployment of trade working capital and expanding our supply chain finance program.\nAs of December 31, we had total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio 2.3x EBITDA. We paid down over $375 million in debt between the acquisition of Uni-Select at the beginning of August and year-end, a portion of which came from the sale proceeds related to the GSF business we divested in October. We remain committed to reducing our total leverage ratio to 2.0x within 18 months of the Uni-Select acquisition or more specifically during Q1 2025.\nOur current maturities include the EUR 500 million senior notes due on April 1, we are working on refinancing options and expect to have a refinancing in place in the near term. Our effective borrowing rate was 5.8% for the quarter as market rates remained relatively high in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.2 billion in unhedged variable rate debt, so a 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $12 million.\nI will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2024 results as shown on Slides 6 and 7. Our guidance is based on current market conditions, recent trends and assume scrap and precious metal prices hold near December prices. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.09, the pound sterling at $1.27 and the Canadian dollar at $0.74.\nWe expect organic parts and services revenue growth between 3.5% and 5.5%. Please note that we have 1 to 2 more selling days in 2024, depending on the market, with the increase coming in the second half of the year. Europe will be down a selling day in Q1 due to the timing of Easter. Our 2024 estimate includes growth associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm and the impact of Uni-Select, which will be included in organic parts and services revenue beginning on August 1.\nWe are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 with a midpoint of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.22 or 6% at the midpoint relative to the 2023 actual figure.\nLooking at Slide 6 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2023 actual EPS to our 2024 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.22 relative to the 2023 results with growth coming from all 4 segments. We expect Europe and North America, including the Uni-Select contribution to generate more year-over-year growth than specialty and self-service. The transitory items in Europe noted in the last few quarters are expected to be a lesser impact in 2024 and thus will add $0.09 compared to 2023.\nThe exchange rate benefit is nominal. Commodity prices are expected to be a headwind of $0.09 as the current precious metal prices used in the guidance are below the 2023 average. Excluding the impact of Uni-Select, interest expense is projected to be a nominal impact with a higher average rate mitigated by debt paydowns.\nConsistent with past practices, we have not anticipated future share repurchases beyond the call date of our guidance. We have included an effective tax rate of 26.8% in our 2024 guidance in line with the final 2023 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, achieving an EBITDA conversion to free cash flow in the low 50% range.\nThere are various puts and takes in this estimate, including higher cash payments for interest in building inventory, offset by improved earnings and increased payables. Capital spending is expected to be at the high end of our target range, again, at $350 million, which includes key investments in salvage capacity and specialty distribution to support productivity and margin enhancement initiatives. We feel good about the projected full year cash flow estimate and the conversion ratio, generating $1 billion in free cash flow provides flexibility to continue a balanced capital allocation strategy, including debt paydowns, our quarterly dividend, share repurchases and investments in high-synergy tuck-in acquisitions.\nIn terms of quarterly phasing, we expect the earnings growth to be weighted more heavily to the back half of the year. Q1 has been affected by extreme weather conditions in certain markets and very low catalytic converter prices, which in recent weeks were running near 50% of the price in the same period of 2023. Q1 will also be affected by the timing of Easter, resulting in a loss selling day in Europe. The balance of the year will benefit from the additional selling base mentioned previously and a ramp-up of Uni-Select synergies as the year progresses.\nThanks for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call to Justin to discuss his vision and priorities for LKQ going forward.\n\nJustin L. Jude\n\nSVP of Operations - Wholesale Parts Division, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on the call. First, I am honored to be chosen to succeed Nick later this year as the next Chief Executive Officer of LKQ. And I'm humbled to be able to lead our talented team into the future. I'd like to thank Nick for his mentorship and leadership. Our board trusted me to lead LKQ through this next chapter and most importantly, I'd like to thank my wife and kids for their love, patience and support because without them, I wouldn't to be where I am today.\nAs I prepare to step into the CEO role in July, I am filled with enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility. My vision for LKQ is rooted in 3 fundamental principles: people, growth and operational excellence. People are at the heart of LKQ. My first and foremost commitment is to each of my fellow team members across our global organization who are the backbone in essence of LKQ. LKQ's employee-focused culture centered around communication, accountability, integrity and respect is not just a goal. It's a necessity for our collective success.\nGrowing our business, delivering excellent service and products to our customers is a part of who we are. We will drive revenue organically by growing share of wallet with our customers and being opportunistic on tuck-in acquisitions. And lastly, operational excellence. We will continue to hone our culture of lean management throughout our operations. This will not only improve our financial metrics, but will also provide a consistent and repeatable operating rhythm where our customers will see continual improvements in our service levels.\nAlongside these principles, we will focus on 4 key priorities: first, integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, drive high levels of free cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy and return capital back to our shareholders and finally, invest in our future.\nIn the short term, the North American wholesale team is focused on the integration of our Uni-Select acquisition and taking full advantage of the tremendous synergies that exist within our global footprint. I'm extremely proud of how the team is performing with the integration. As of today, we have integrated a total of 75 of the 151 FinishMaster locations representing over 52% of the consolidated revenue.\nCorporate synergies are largely complete and on pace to slightly exceed our expectations. The overall synergy plan is on track to deliver above our previously stated targets well ahead of schedule. The Bumper to Bumper business in Canada completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions in October of 2023, representing a total of 14 locations as we convert some of that market from 3-step to 2-step. And Bumper to Bumper is working closely with our North American and European procurement teams to maximize additional revenue and cost synergies.\nIn January, Bumper to Bumper placed their first purchase order with our Europe's private label team, and we are confident these synergistic orders will increase over time, enhancing our offering and our competitiveness. Importantly, I want to again emphasize that Uni-Select was a unique opportunity that will enable us to widen the moat around our North American business and capitalize on revenue synergies and both in the paint and the hard part side that weren't there prior to this acquisition.\nOur North American teams are the best operators, motivators and integrators in the industry and the results since starting our operational excellence journey and 2019 speaks for itself. I am confident of their ability to generate positive, operational and financial returns with our Uni-Select business integration.\nLong term, in North America, we will continue to invest both in the recycled and remanufactured EV battery process as we are a national fit to become the market leader in this growing space.\nTurning to Europe. Over the last 45 days, I spent time with our European leadership team diving into multiple aspects of their business. Andy Hamilton, our new CEO of Europe, and I agree that there are many levers to pull in Europe. Our primary objective is to accelerate the integration of 1 LKQ Europe to fully leverage the network of our inventory, which today is still largely country specific.\nBy linking the geographical and regional distribution network across our European footprint, we will drive higher levels of productivity, leading to improved fulfillment rates, enhanced customer service and improved trade working capital. Achieving this objective will allow us to profitably grow and increase our market-leading position.\nAdditionally, in Europe, there is an opportunity to grow our offerings in such areas as private label, collision components, diagnostics and calibration, recycling, remanufacturing and EV aftermarket parts. We also have the ability to expand our LKQ Academy, a program that we offer to independent garages to enhance their EV knowledge base and capabilities allowing these shops to see the changing technology as an opportunity.\nLastly, I believe we have an opportunity to rationalize certain areas of our business through facility consolidation and fleet and logistics network optimization, which will allow us to create efficiencies across geographies and product groups.\nAs we work through our ongoing integration efforts, we will continue to assess our mix of businesses and take decisive actions to determine if we are the right owners of certain assets prior to integrating.\nIn closing, I am extremely excited about driving our mission forward and expanding a lean operating model across our entire organization with a primary objective to move swiftly. LKQ has an extraordinary history and importantly, an extremely bright future.\nNow let me turn it back over to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Justin, for your thoughtful perspective and comments and Rick for that detailed financial overview. Our organization has once again proven to be incredibly resilient in any operating environment. Our global teams have worked with agility and urgency to continuously achieve positive results with our operational excellence strategy and establishing 1 LKQ, a unified and globally focused team.\nThis success is a direct result of a shared mission amongst our over 49,000 employees, which is simply being the leading global value-added and sustainable distributor vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive, available and cost-effective selection of parts and service solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. I'm confident LKQ will live that mission in 2024 and excel through this leadership transition. LKQ's future is very bright with Justin at the helm.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nI'd like to go ahead and introduce our speaker today, Joe Boutross, with LKQ Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Joe. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and provide an overview of our updated guidance, before I come back with a few closing remarks.\nThe third quarter of 2023 represented some mixed results, which collectively fell short of our expectations. Wholesale North America continued to outperform, all while working on the integration of the Uni-Select acquisition. However, we experienced some unusual transitory events that, in aggregate, affected the short-term performance of our European operations. We also had continued pressure on commodities, which impacted self-service, along with less-than-expected demand for our specialty products.\nThe LKQ culture is one that takes accountability for results and is humble enough to understand that this quarter's results fell short of both our expectations and the expectations that may view on the call. Make no mistake, the shift to our operational excellence strategy implemented in 2019 has not changed.\nStructurally, our business model and financial outlook are sound, and we continue to be very optimistic about the future of LKQ. One quarter does not define the resiliency of our business model, the uniqueness of our global enterprise or the long-term opportunities that lie ahead for LKQ. The perpetual challenging macroeconomic conditions are not unique to LKQ, and they will continue to persist, but the LKQ team will move forward.\nOn the positive side, we continue to experience strong organic revenue growth in our North American and European businesses achieving same-day growth of 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively. North America achieved excellent EBITDA margins, which were ahead of expectations, and our free cash flow was excellent, particularly in North America and Europe.\nOn the downside, during the quarter, we faced a few unusual and transitory headwinds. In late September, our Italian subsidiary, Rhiag, completed a negotiation with the Italian tax authorities on the remediation of a value-added tax violation that was committed by certain of our third-party suppliers dating back to 2017. These suppliers are no longer in business, and thus, Rhiag agreed to remit the disputed amounts to the Italian revenue agency to remedy any damage caused by the VAT violations of the former suppliers.\nAdditionally, our German operation was hit with periodic strikes at our large distribution center, which reduced ability to fully replenish branch network with inventory on a daily basis. Negotiations with the workers' council are ongoing, but there have been additional strikes in October, which will affect our Q4 results. It's important to note that resolving the matter is not fully in our control as the labor contract involved with some multiple employers in Southern Germany that must agree on terms through the employers association.\nThese 2 items alone reduced our European organic growth by approximately 160 basis points and reduced segment EBITDA margins by 110 basis points. While we are disappointed with these 2 transitory items, our long-term view of the growth and margin potential of our European business has not changed.\nRelated to commodities, pricing pressure continued in the third quarter, with scrap and precious metal down sequentially 14% and 23%, respectively, decreasing both margins and earnings per share. For context, in Q3, catalytic converter prices fell below $100 for the first time since early 2019, versus the third quarter of last year, when they averaged $197. This difficult commodity environment, again, had a particularly negative impact on the profitability of our self-service segment.\nRick will provide a deeper dive into the EPS and segment margin details in the quarter when he discusses our updated guidance. The quarter included many other highlights worth noting. The company generated robust free cash flow, and we are on target to again reach $1 billion for 2023. On August 1, we announced the completion of the Uni-Select acquisition, a bespoke and highly synergistic opportunity that will add positive long-term shareholder value and further widen the competitive moat around our North American business.\nYesterday, we completed the sale of GSF Car Parts to Epiris, a private equity firm based in the U.K. The proceeds from the sale will be used for debt repayments. And finally, our Board has declared a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from [ $0.275 ] to $0.30 per share of common stock. This increase reflects the board's ongoing confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid free cash flow and drive long-term value for our shareholders.\nNow on to the third quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 15%. Parts and services organic revenue increased 3% on a reported basis and 4.3% on a per day basis. Diluted earnings per share was $0.77 as compared to $0.95 for the same period last year, a decrease of 18.9%. While adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.86 compared to $0.97 for the same period of 2022, a decrease of 11.3%.\nLet's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 8, organic revenue for parts and services for North America increased 4.1% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that noncomprehensive related auto claims were down 4.3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Similar to the first half of the year, the growth in North America was a combination of price and volume improvements, with the organic growth in our aftermarket collision products predominantly being volume-related.\nThese nice volume increases were driven by our disciplined procurement efforts that allowed us to achieve the proper levels of inventory and the ability to stabilize and maintain our industry-leading fulfillment rates of over 93%, which helped us grow the business. The strong volume was also attributable to State Farm, expanding their usage of aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumpers beginning earlier this year.\nFurther on State Farm, during our last call, I mentioned that State Farm launched another pilot program in California and Arizona for the use of a full range of aftermarket collision parts, including sheet metal products like fenders, hoods and trunk leads and other items like side mirrors and grills. Today, I am pleased to share that on October 16, State Farm announced that they are rolling out the use of these parts nationally to collision repair shops, which are part of their DRP program.\nWe expect the incremental lift from this expansion at a full run rate will reflect a $20 million to $30 million annual benefit in revenues once fully ramped up. With respect to the UAW strikes, we believe that a continuation of the strikes will create incremental demand for our aftermarket and, to a lesser extent, our recycled collision parts.\nBecause the strike started in late September, there was no impact on our third quarter results, but we are starting to see an incremental per day volume uptick across all product lines, with some lines that have historically been sourced primarily from the OEs expanding at a faster rate.\nObviously, we don't know how long this demand benefit will last, so we have not adjusted guidance for the UAW strike.\nNorth America EBITDA margins exceeded our expectations for the quarter, and we are on track to achieve the greater than 19% full year target we have previously discussed, excluding the anticipated dilution of Uni-Select.\nLet's move to our European segment. Europe's organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.2% on a per day basis. While the market remains competitive, the business is performing well by increasing the organic growth rate in the quarter, mostly driven by volume. During the third quarter, we saw solid organic growth in all of our regions, despite the impact of the strikes in Germany, with regional same-day organic growth ranging from approximately 4.7% on the low end to 16.3% on the high end and a total same-day growth rate of 6.2%.\nExcluding the impact of the strike, the same-day growth rate was just shy of 8%, which is outstanding. The diversity of our European platform is also highlighted by the dispersion in EBITDA margins, with key lines of business and markets posting margins in the low teens, while certain smaller markets delivering mid-single-digit performance. While the labor situation will weigh on our margins in Q4, we remain confident in the long-term margin potential of our European operations.\nNow let's move on to our Specialty segment, which continues to face a soft demand environment. During the third quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 6.1% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a per day basis, which again was below our expectations. As in the past, there were major differences in the demand for various part types. With the RV OEM warranty products and truck and off-road products up 3% and 2%, respectively, during the quarter, while RV accessories and towing-related products were off double digits on a year-over-year basis.\nThe RV portion of our specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail unit sales of RVs, which were down 45% and 17% year-to-date through August, respectively. Though still down, the specialty revenue decline in the third quarter was less significant than in the first half of the year. Still, we don't see a natural near-term catalyst for demand to bounce back, and we anticipate tough comparisons into the start of 2024.\nNow on to the self-service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our self-service segment increased 5.1% in the third quarter. Self-service was again confronted by the decrease in metals pricing, I mentioned earlier, particularly with respect to catalytic converters, which are linked to precious metal prices. Operationally, the self-service team also had challenges with their ability to source vehicles at the appropriate cost. Simply put, car costs have not declined in lockstep with commodity prices, creating significant margin pressures and pushing self-service into a loss position for the third quarter.\nWe have already taken action with our buying practices and have installed an operational leader to drive standardization and process improvements across our self-service buying group. The leadership team has also taken actions to reduce overhead costs, and the early returns have been positive. We expect this business to be marginally profitable in Q4.\nAs reported, we closed on the Uni-Select acquisition on August 1. The integration activities and synergies are on target and, in some cases, ahead of schedule. This past week, we completed the first wave of FinishMaster facility optimizations, with 10 locations being folded into an existing LKQ aftermarket warehouse location and 2 other FinishMaster locations being merged. From here, we will begin to see an acceleration of our footprint optimization.\nOur sales force and operations teams dedicated to the paint and related products market have been fully aligned, and we've built out a synergy tracking team with various tools and metrics to assure we hit the targets we established when we announced the transaction back in February. Now that we've owned the business for a few months, we see a slight shift in the FinishMaster business with MSOs representing a slightly larger share of activity. As you know, the MSOs are some of our largest customers on the parts side of the business.\nThe bumper to bumper business in Canada is actively working with our European team to assess and take advantage of the procurement leverage that exists between their respective businesses. We have completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions in Canada that Uni-Select had in the hopper, and we have another small transaction that will close shortly. We are excited about the growth opportunities in Canada and believe we have a great team to execute the plan. Overall, I am confident in our North America team managing the Uni-Select integration, and that they will deliver the same strong results as they've had with their operational excellence efforts over the last 3 years.\nLet me now turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our updated outlook for 2023.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As Nick mentioned, our third quarter results reflected a mix of positives and negatives, but on 'balance was below our expectations. Cash flow generation in our North America segment margins continue to be bright spots for us, and we will continue to build on these strengths.\nThe earnings pressure was attributable to a combination of unusual items, softness in precious metal prices, and difficult market conditions impacting our Specialty and self-service segments. While we expect challenges around economic conditions, commodity prices and exchange rates to impact the fourth quarter, we remain highly confident in the prospects of the overall business as the fundamental strengths that have driven strong results since we implemented our operational excellence strategy in 2019 remain intact.\nI will now provide further details on the financials, starting with cash flows and the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.0 billion, including the $1.4 billion bond offering from May, with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA. With the August 1 acquisition of Uni-Select, we drew down a CAD 700 million term loan and approximately $150 million on our revolving credit facility to complete the funding.\nBy hedging the Canadian dollar exchange rate after announcing the transaction, we were able to save almost [ $50 million ] on the U.S. dollar equivalent of the purchase price which is a terrific outcome. Factoring in the proceeds from the hedge settlement and the cash acquired, our net cash out for the Uni-Select acquisition dropped down from $2.1 billion to $2.0 billion.\nWe committed to paying down debt post acquisition to bring our total leverage ratio below 2.0x again within 18 months, and we got to work on this pledge in August and September, during which we paid down over $200 million of revolver debt with our free cash flow. As of September 30, our total leverage ratio was 2.3x, so consistent with the June level and we expect a reduction in the leverage ratio as of year-end.\nThe proceeds from the sale of GSF will be utilized to reduce our total debt, putting us in a better position to begin implementing a more balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes share repurchases. The Q3 debt repayments were possible because of our solid balance sheet and the generation of $344 million in free cash flow during the quarter. Through September, free cash flow is $911 million, and we are raising our full year guidance to approximately $1.0 billion in recognition of the strong performance year-to-date.\nI am pleased with our ability to meet the free cash flow expectations despite the headwind from acquisition-related transaction, restructuring and financing costs of almost $50 million. Also during the quarter, we invested $65 million on tuck-in acquisitions, and we paid a dividend of $74 million in September. As Nick mentioned, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share, which speaks to our confidence in being able to generate robust free cash flows through economic cycles.\nOur effective borrowing rate rose to 5.5% for the quarter due to global market rate increases. We have $2.1 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 2 to 3 years, respectively.\nMoving to segment performance. Starting on Slide 10. North America reported a segment EBITDA margin of 17.0%, which includes the results of Uni-Select effective August 1. And we previously disclosed, Uni-Select operates at a lower margin than our legacy North America business because of the mix of product it sells. Adding Uni-Select diluted the North America margins by 180 basis points. Without Uni-Select, North America continued its strong performance, with a Q3 margin of 18.8% and stayed on track to finish the year with a segment EBITDA margin in the low 19% range. consistent with what we disclosed last quarter.\nNorth America gross margin decreased 60 basis points, in line with expectations, with a decrease in salvage margins tied to car costs. Overhead expenses were roughly flat year-over-year. After the acquisition of Uni-Select, the North America team was able to work on integration and achieve a better understanding of the timing of our original assumptions. With increased access to personnel and visibility of financial and operational data, we are updating our projections for 2023 for Uni-Select to be dilutive in the range of $0.04 to $0.06.\nAs Nick mentioned, we are focused on integration and are accelerating synergies related to FinishMaster branches to drive improvement relative to the estimated range and maximize the 2024 benefits. We remain confident in our investment thesis of Uni-Select, and we believe the transaction will be accretive in 2024.\nEurope delivered segment EBITDA margin of 9.3%, down 200 basis points from the prior period. There were a couple of unusual items that had a negative effect of 110 basis points on the results Nick mentioned. First, we booked a charge for value added tax audit matter in Italy related to prior years for $11 million, which impacted the margin by 70 basis points. We are comfortable that this VAT issue has been addressed and won't have a recurring effect.\nSecond, the strikes at our primary distribution center in Germany had an estimated negative effect on segment EBITDA of 40 basis points. The remaining margin variance is attributable to gross margin compression, primarily in our Central and Eastern European regions related to customer price sensitivity with difficult macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing this matter with specific category management actions to meet price point expectations in the region while helping to improve margins.\nMoving to Slide 12. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 8.6% declined 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 300 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors in addition to unfavorable product mix as lower margin lines, such as auto and marine, have been less affected by revenue reductions.\nSG&A expenses were favorable by 80 basis points, mostly related to personnel and primarily coming from restructuring efforts in the last 12 months to align the cost structure with revenue trends. As the year-over-year organic revenue decrease has narrowed each quarter in 2023 versus the prior year, the same is occurring with segment EBITDA margin, and we expect the trend to continue in Q4 with the margin near last year's figure.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, self-service profitability declined sequentially to a loss of 0.6% this quarter from 4.1% in the second quarter and decreased relative to the 2.6% reported in Q3 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results of $7 million, with lower precious metal prices representing a $17 million reduction in EBITDA and lag effects from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a $10 million improvement. Other revenue decreased by 24.4% in total, contributing to a reduction in operational leverage of 590 basis points.\nWhile car costs typically move in tandem with changes in commodity prices, we continue to experience a stickiness in car cost, which is contributing to margin compression. Now for further details on the consolidated results.\nAs mentioned, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.86 was down $0.11 relative to Q3 last year. The primary negative factors were $0.04 from the impacts of metals prices, as shown on Slide 27, $0.04 from the VAT charge in Italy, $0.04 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding unit costs, and $0.02 attributed to the effects of strikes in Germany. Our operational performance was a slight negative after excluding the items noted previously, as solid gains in North America of $0.02 were offset by the decline in Specialty business of $0.03.\nWe benefited by $0.02 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchase and in 2022, and foreign exchange translation contributed to $0.02 of higher earnings with a stronger euro and pound sterling. On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 27.0%, which is consistent with the rate in our prior guidance.\nI will conclude with our current thoughts on objected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends, and assumes scrap and precious metal prices hold near September levels. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes Balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.06 and the pound sterling at $1.23, in line with current rates. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 4.75% to 5.75%.\nOrganic growth was 5.3% through September. We decreased the range in recognition of the estimated revenue loss associated with the German strike activity, difficult macroeconomic conditions in parts of Europe and the ongoing challenges at Specialty. North America has potential upside in Q4 related to the State Farm rollout and the UAW strike, which could push the full year result above the midpoint of the range.\nWe expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.82, which brings in both the high and low ends of the range from our previous estimate. The midpoint is now $3.75 per share, down from the prior figure of $4 provided last call. And the primary drivers of the decrease in the midpoint are as follows: $0.06 from lost earnings related to the German strike activity, $0.05 of dilution from the Uni-Select acquisition that was not included in the prior guidance as we had not yet closed the transaction, $0.04 from the VAT charge in Italy, $0.04 from metal prices, $0.05 from operations, primarily related to self-service and Specialty, and $0.01 from foreign exchange rates.\nSlide 5 shows the full bridge of the EPS guidance change. We increased our free cash flow guidance to approximately $1.0 billion from $975 million, with a 55% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion. With our year-to-date free cash flow of $911 million, we are anticipating roughly $90 million in Q4, which would be our lowest quarterly amount this year. Part of the sequential decrease is seasonal as we build inventory ahead of the winter -- the busy winter season, and we also have higher interest payments scheduled for Q4 this year as the semiannual interest payment of the $1.4 billion Uni-Select bonds is due in December.\nThank you for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Rick, for that financial overview. Before we open the call for questions, I want to reiterate what our global team has accomplished since starting the operational excellence journey back in 2019.\nIn 2022, North America adjusted EBITDA margins reached their highest full year level in the company's history at 18.7%. Excluding the impact of Uni-Select, we are on track to beat that record again this year. As a reminder, North America ended 2018 which had EBITDA margins at 12.6%. The 1 LKQ Europe program has generated tremendous results since introducing the plan in September 2019, and the segment is on track to consistently drive full year double-digit EBITDA margins.\nImportantly, there is further runway for leveraging our scale and unparalleled distribution network. This is demonstrated by the strong organic revenue growth in the first 9 months of the current fiscal year and a significant year-on-year increase in segment EBITDA of $40 million after taking into account the 2 unusual items that cost the segment $19 million in aggregate.\nWe've generated free cash flow at or above $1 billion for 3 years in a row, and we are on target to make 2023 the fourth.\nWe've divested 16 businesses, representing over $625 million of revenue that did not fit our strategic objectives. We've achieved investment-grade ratings from each of Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. We've repurchased $2.4 billion of stock since initiating our first repurchase plan in October of 2018. We've distributed $578 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. And we've achieved a AAA ESG rating from MSCI and built out a team to drive our global sustainability effort forward with targeted objectives.\nSo yes, we are very LKQ proud. As we move forward towards the end of 2023, let me restate the key strategic pillars, which remain central to our culture and objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn, give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And lastly, we will continue to invest in our future.\nAs always, I want to thank the over 49,000 people who work for LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission and our LKQ Delivers Values forward regardless of the challenges. Without a doubt, our people are LKQ's biggest asset.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions."

I'm your operator JL. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Joe Boutross, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P.

And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. I hope you're all having a safe and enjoyable summer. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and provide an overview of our updated guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks.\nThe second quarter of 2023 was a continuation of what we delivered in the first quarter, where, again, the resilience of our businesses shined through with an exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American and European segments, which more than offset the impact of the headwinds experienced by our Specialty and Self-Service segments. The nondiscretionary nature of the parts these core segments distribute, coupled with our ongoing operational excellence initiatives highlights the strength of our business model and our ability to generate robust profitability during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, including flat declining economic growth in several of our markets, decreases in commodity pricing, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its impact on the broader European markets and the continued increases in interest rates and its subsequent impact on consumers.\nThe strength of our North American and European segments is evidenced by the fact that in the second quarter of 2023, North America and Europe collectively represented roughly 90% of our total segment EBITDA versus 79% for the second quarter of 2022 and just 74% in 2021. The variance in performance across our operating segments this quarter again validates our long-term diversification strategy, both with respect to geography and product and speaks to the true strength of our organization and our portfolio of businesses.\nNow on to the second quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue for the second quarter was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.2%. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.8% on a reported basis and 5.4% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was flat year-over-year and foreign exchange rates increased revenue by [ 6% ] for total parts and services revenue increases of 5.4%. Other revenue fell 23.9% in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in the prior year. Net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $281 million as compared to $420 million last year.\nDiluted earnings per share was $1.05 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $1.49, a decrease of 29.5%. The company completed the divestiture of PGW auto glass in the second quarter of last year, which generated a pretax gain of $155 million and an after-tax gain of $127 million or $0.45 a share in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income of $291 million in Q2 of 2023 compared to $307 million last year, a decrease of 5.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2023 was flat with last year at $1.09, coming in flat to the prior year is a testament to the strength of our operating performance as we faced headwinds from significantly lower commodity prices and higher interest expense.\nRick will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 8, organic parts and services revenue for North America increased 8.3%. North America also reported the highest quarterly EBITDA margin on record as a stand-alone segment, excluding self-service. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that collision and liability-related auto claims were down 3.1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Similar to Q1, the growth in North America was a combination of price and volume improvements. The pricing impact primarily reflected the year-over-year benefit of increases implemented late in Q2 and Q3 of last year as opposed to further increases in 2023. The volume pickup was particularly evident in the aftermarket product line and was the result of 2 factors. First, having largely worked through the industry supply chain issues and returning to proper levels of inventory enabled us to get back to our historical level of fulfillment rates with year-to-date aftermarket fill rates at their highest level since June of 2020. Second, the impact of the State Farm program continues to unfold nicely and is building demand for aftermarket headlights, tail lights and bumper covers. As previously disclosed, in December of last year, State Farm announced that it would allow the use of these aftermarket part types. Late last month, State Farm announced that they are running yet another pilot. This time in California and Arizona, for the use of a full range of aftermarket collision parts, including sheet metal products like fenders, hoods and trunk lids and other items like side mirrors and grills. As part of this pilot, State Farm requires at these parts to be certified by CAPA, a certified Automotive Parts Association, As many of you know, we are by far the largest distributor of CAPA-certified collision parts in the United States.\nImportantly, we believe the potential expansion by State Farm into the utilization of these additional aftermarket part types validates both the high-quality standards of our platinum plus private label aftermarket parts offerings and our ability to deliver best-in-class service to state firm's direct repair network across the country. We will be a beneficiary should State Farm ultimately decide to roll out the use of these additional aftermarket part types on a nationwide basis. This upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes is consistent with a general rise in alternative part usage or APU, which again approached pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. I am pleased to say that the increase in APU also included an uptick in the recycled parts category, increasing about 140 basis points year-over-year. Combined, aftermarket recycled parts have witnessed over a 400 basis point improvement in industry-wide APU year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023.\nOur outperformance is another indicator that we continue to take market share. Noncomprehensive total loss rates decreased sequentially in the second quarter to 20.4% from 20.9% in Q1. With the recent drop from used car prices, we expect total loss rates to slightly pick up for the balance of the year. And then as OEs work through their healthy inventory levels, industry experts believe we will likely see a mix shift to newer vehicles down the road and would expect to see any near-term increase in total losses to reverse cars given newer vehicles are less likely to be deemed a total loss. As stated in prior calls, we are generally agnostic as to the small up and down shifts in the total loss rate. Finally, last month, I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with the top-performing general managers and salespeople at an event for our North American business. I must say their enthusiasm regarding the future of LKQ was simply energizing.\nNow let's move on to our European segment. Europe's organic revenue growth for parts and services in the quarter increased 8.5% on a reported basis and 9.8% on a per day basis. It was a quarter of records for the European segment, which reported the highest quarterly revenue ever at $1.64 billion, the highest EBITDA at $188 million and the highest second quarter EBITDA margin percentage ever at 11.5%. During the quarter, we saw high single-digit to low double-digit reported organic growth in some of our key operating geographies. In particular, our Benelux, Germany and Eastern European operations performed exceptionally well. The revenue growth reflected a combination of positive movements in both price and volume. We are confident we are continuing to take share in these large and highly fragmented markets as witnessed by ECP, our U.K. business, which generated its highest level of per day sales on record. In the second quarter, LKQ Europe entered into a strategic partnership with Mobivia, Europe's largest independent provider of automotive maintenance and repair services operating under 11 brands in 18 countries across Europe. The agreement between Mobivia and LKQ Europe is based on a dual mode of collaboration which includes the procurement and delivery of automotive parts to Mobivia's 530 ATU service branches across Germany. LKQ and Mobivia are both leaders in our respective sectors of the European automotive aftermarket. And thanks to this collaboration, we will leverage our strengths to provide a differentiated solution that is unparalleled in the marketplace. Our European team continues to face cost inflation across all operating markets. And to combat this, the team has taken decisive structural and multiple efficiency actions. These actions resulted in year-over-year improvements in SG&A for the second quarter despite this challenging macro environment. I spent last week in Europe meeting with all the senior leaders across this segment and also with the regional teams in the U.K. and the Benelux region. I am incredibly proud of the performance of the European team in what they are delivering. And I am very excited about all the initiatives they have underway to grow the business and enhance our leading competitive position. The team's focus and drive our outstanding and they are creating a uniquely special and market-leading business.\nNow let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 12.9%, which was below our expectations. There were major differences in the demand for various part types with the truck, off-road and marine categories being down less than 2%, while RV and towing related products were off substantially more than the overall segment decline. The RV portion of our specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail sales of RVs, which were down 50% and 20% year-to-date through May, respectively. We expect to see further declines in the RV market as recent industry reports project that full year 2023 wholesale shipments will be down 40% year-over-year. With that, we believe the challenges for our Specialty segment will continue in the back half of the year.\nNow on to our Self-Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self-Service segment increased 4.7% in the second quarter. Self-service was again challenged by extremely soft commodity pricing particularly as it related to precious metals. On the corporate development front, during the quarter and recently in July, we completed some smaller, highly synergistic tuck-in acquisitions including a U.S.-based remanufacturer and distributor of OE replacement engines, marine replacement engines and high-performance trade engines, a leading independent truck parts distributor in the U.K., a Holland-based automotive aftermarket parts distributor, a Belgium-based business that distributes automotive parts, paint, tools and accessories and aftermarket accessories distributor with locations in Texas and Oklahoma. Additionally, during the quarter, we divested a small noncore business in our Specialty segment. The net annualized revenue impact of these 6 transactions collectively is approximately $240 million.\nAs most of you know, on February 26, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares for CAD 48 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately USD 2.1 billion. The process is on schedule, and we are pleased with our progress. During the second quarter, we received the required approvals from Uni-Select shareholders, the Superior Court of Quebec, the antitrust regulators in the United States and in Canada. On July 21, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom issued its Phase 1 decision on the transaction. And in response, we immediately submitted our proposed undertakings related to the divestiture of Uni-Select's GSF car parts business in the U.K. for evaluation by the CMA. In light of those developments, yesterday, we waived the closing conditions relating to regulatory approvals, and I'm happy to announce we plan to complete the acquisition of Uni-Select on or about August 1. The pending divestiture of GSF continues to progress in accordance with our desired time line. After we complete the customary competitive bid sale process, this CMA will complete its suitability review of our [indiscernible] buyer. Upon we see the approval of the buyer from the CMA, we will complete the sale of GSF likely in the third quarter. Now turning to ESG.\nDuring the order we initiated or expanded various programs that centered around our people, LKQ's most important asset. As part of our response to our employee engagement survey, we identified that ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees is essential for our success. With that engagement data, we took action. We expanded our Inspire to thrive wellness program globally, which focuses on the physical, mental and financial well-being of our employees. We expanded the installation of dash cams across our North America and specialty fleets, a program that enhances the safety of our drivers. And at ECP, our team implemented 2 exciting programs, 25 by 25 and PAVE, which stands for people adding value everywhere. Both these programs are centered around our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Again, we implemented these programs as they are in the best interest of our employees. I could not be prouder of the continued progress on our ESG efforts, which was again validated in June by MSCI maintaining our AAA ESG rating a rating that very few companies can claim. Lastly, I am pleased to announce that on July 25, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on August 31, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2023.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Rick who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. The second quarter was another solid performance from the business with highlights including record high segment EBITDA margin of 20.6% in North America and at 11.5%, the highest quarterly margin in a decade for Europe, organic revenue growth in the high single digits in North America and Europe, operating improvements countering headwinds from commodity prices and interest costs.\nStrong free cash flow of $414 million in the quarter and the completion of a $1.4 billion bond offering to secure financing for the pending Uni-Select acquisition. I want to reiterate Nick's thanks to the global LKQ team for delivering exceptional results in difficult conditions. To provide further details on these results, I will start with comments on segment performance.\nGoing to Slide 10. North America continued its strong performance, posting a segment EBITDA margin of 20.6%, a 190 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 150 basis points driven by lower freight costs, pricing and productivity initiatives and a favorable mix effect with the sale of the lower-margin PGW business. Overhead expenses were favored by 40 basis points, primarily due to lower freight, vehicle and fuel expenses. With the continued strong performance in our North American segment, we believe the full year segment EBITDA margins will finish the year in the low 19% range with some moderation in the second half of 2023 with salvage margins tightening, along with some normal seasonality.\nEurope also delivered terrific results with a segment EBITDA margin of 11.5%, up 70 basis points from the prior year period. As seen on Slide 11, gross margin improved by 20 basis points, while overhead expenses decreased by 50 basis points with the effect of improved leverage due to the 9.8% per day organic revenue growth and emphasis on productivity initiatives on personnel costs and reduced freight costs. There are some headwinds anticipated in the second half of the year as personnel costs increased due to wage inflation. We intend to mitigate these increases through productivity initiatives, and we remain optimistic about our previously disclosed expectation for full year margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 12. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 9.5% declined 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 370 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve our competitors in addition to unfavorable product mix as lower margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions. Overhead expenses were up 20 basis points, primarily from the decrease in leverage driven by organic revenue decline of 12.9% per day. The specialty team continues to take actions to align the cost structure with revenue trends, and prior restructuring efforts have provided some benefit in the second quarter to counteract the revenue softness.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, Self-Service profitability declined sequentially to 4.1% this quarter from 13.2% in the first quarter and decreased relative to the 15.3% reported in Q2 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results with lower precious metal prices, representing a $50 million reduction in EBITDA and an unfavorable lag effect from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a further $5 million decline. Other revenue decreased by 28.3% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points. Relative to Q2 2022, the average price received for catalytic converters in Q2 2023 declined by 39% and scrap steel fell by 20%. While car cost typically move in tandem, which changes in commodity prices, we have experienced a stickiness in car costs, which were only down 12% relative to Q2 2022. These trends created a gross margin headwind in the second quarter that could persist in the second half of the year.\nNow for further details on the consolidated results. As mentioned, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was flat to Q2 last year. Our operational performance showed strong year-over-year improvement with a net increase of $0.11 per share on an adjusted basis, driven by solid gains in North America and Europe, partially offset by the decline in the specialty business. We benefited by $0.04 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. These factors [ were ex ] of $0.08 from the impact of metal prices, as shown on Slide 27, $0.05 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate. On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 27.0% and which is 40 basis points higher than the 26.6% in our prior guidance. The rate change is attributable to nondeductible units like transaction costs and other effects related to the Uni-Select financing.\nAs shown on Slide 18, the Uni-Select transaction affected various parts of the second quarter financials. The income statement effects of the pre-acquisition net financing expenses and transaction costs have been excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. Once we complete the acquisition, going forward, interest expense will be reflected in adjusted diluted earnings per share. In May, we completed the offering of $1.4 billion of senior notes due in 2028 and 2033. We're happy with the results of the offering as a first-time investment-grade issuer, obtaining financing at 5.75% and 6.25% for the 5- and 10-year maturities was an outstanding outcome. We recorded interest expense on the bonds for the period between the issuance date and the quarter end in the interest expense line on the income statement. The interest earned from the bond proceeds is reflected in interest and other income.\nIn Q1, we hedged the interest rate risk prior to the issuance of permanent financing in the bond market. Upon issuance of the bonds, we unwind these interest rate swaps and settled by making a payment of $13 million. As these swaps qualified for hedge accounting, the loss was held on the balance sheet and will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the bonds. With the completion of the bond offering, we terminated the bridge loan facility and amortized the remaining $6 million of upfront fees in Q2. To hedge the risk related to the movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rates between signing and closing, in Q1, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at a specified rate. These contracts had a fair value of $46 million as of June 30. And as we are not eligible for hedge accounting on these contracts, the mark-to-market gain is reflected in the income statement as a separate line item. We incurred M&A advisory costs of $6 million in the quarter, which are presented in restructuring and transaction-related expenses.\nShifting to cash flows in the balance sheet. With the $1.4 billion bond offering and CAD 700 million term loan, we have secured the necessary financing for the Uni-Select transaction. By completing the bond offering ahead of the deal closing, we are carrying more cash on the balance sheet than usual at $1.9 billion. If you set aside the roughly $1.4 billion earmarked for the acquisition, we have $519 million in cash and $1.2 billion of available liquidity as of June 30. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.0 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA, which takes into account the additional debt for funding Uni-Select and none of the projected EBITDA from the acquisition. The increase in the total leverage ratio above our target range of 2.0x was expected as we disclosed in our prior Uni-Select communications. We are committed to reducing our leverage ratio below 2.0x within 18 months of closing the transaction upon achieving our target leverage ratio, we'll return to our balanced capital allocation strategy, including share repurchases. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 5.3% for the quarter due to global market rate increases. The increase in the leverage ratio above the 2.0x will trigger a 12.5 basis point increase in our credit facility margin going forward. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 2 to 3 years, respectively.\nWe produced $414 million in free cash flow during the quarter and at $567 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $975 million. Compared to the year-to-date June 2022, free cash flow was down $71 million with higher outflows from income taxes of $39 million, interest of $38 million and capital spending of $37 million. These are the 3 areas we highlighted as headwinds in our February call, and the actual results are playing out mostly as expected. Interest payments will be a larger headwind than originally projected because of higher interest rates and the impact of Uni-Select financing coming on to the books before the acquisition closes. As previously mentioned, we have paused our share repurchase program and directed our free cash flow to paying down debt of $131 million in the second quarter as well as tuck-in acquisitions of $27 million. Additionally, we paid a quarterly dividend of $74 million.\nI will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current economic conditions and recent trends and assume scrap and precious metal prices hold near June levels and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and mouse driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.09 and the pound sterling at $1.25, in line with June rates. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 6.0% to 7.5%. Organic growth was 6.4% through June. We decreased the high end of the range in recognition of the ongoing challenges at specialty, which is down 13% year-to-date. We expect specialty to reduce the year-over-year decline in the second half of the year, but the lower full year expectation makes reaching 8% at the consolidated level unlikely. Please note, we have 1 fewer selling day in North America, Europe in specialty in Q3. We expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.10, which brings in the high end of the range from our previous estimate, while there is no change to the low end. The midpoint is now $4 per share, down $0.05 from our prior figure. We anticipate North America and Europe continue to perform ahead of prior expectations and are mitigating softness in our specialty segment, resulting in net operational growth of $0.05. However, the negative effects of declining metals prices of $0.07 and higher interest and tax expenses of $0.03 are more than offsetting this operational growth. Slide 5 shows the primary factors contributing to the EPS guidance change.\nThere is no change to our free cash flow expectation of approximately $975 million and 55% annual EBITDA conversion, noting a portion of the Uni-Select transaction fees and pre-acquisition interest costs will have a onetime impact to free cash flow and create a headwind that we expect to overcome. To be clear, the numbers I just quoted do not include operating results for Uni-Select. We expect to close on Uni-Select on or about August 1 and assuming that timing, we are projecting the acquisition will be dilutive to adjusted diluted EPS by $0.02 to $0.04 per share in fiscal 2023. While we believe the transaction will be accretive over the first 12 months, in the early months, it is expected to be dilutive due to the integration costs and the time required to begin to achieve the synergies. Our overall expectation for the businesses have not changed, and we are excited to bring them in as part of the LKQ family.\nThank you for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, the second quarter was another solid performance for team LKQ. I am beyond proud of the results we delivered for the first half of the year, particularly how the teams are diligently planning and positioning their respective businesses for the balance of 2023 as we continue to be challenged by certain uncontrollable dynamics.\nAs we move into the second half of the year, let me restate our key strategic pillars, which remain central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 46,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our missions and our delivers values forward regardless of the challenges.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions."

My name is Rob, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC this morning.\nAs normal, we are planning to file our 10-Qs in the coming days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Rick will dive into the financial details before I come back with a few closing remarks.\nOn February 28, the company kicked off a year-long celebration of our 25th anniversary by ringing the opening bell at NASDAQ. The celebration is focused on our 25-year history, our customers, our employees, the communities that we serve and further energizing our global team about our future. Following this initial celebration, we hosted leadership conferences in both North America and Europe for key leaders across each of our operating segments where we all had a chance to celebrate, educate and collaborate on our past successes and share the excitement of what the future holds for LKQ.\nWhile we've had a great run since 1998, I am highly confident that the next 25 years will be even better. As an organization, we have always held a core set of values that has helped us achieve our success and created the LKQ we are today. Like all aspects of life, change is inevitable and as an organization, it's critical that we advance our values forward to lay the foundation for the next 25 years.\nKeeping us moving forward. During the quarter, I had the pleasure to announce our updated values for the future. Values that unite our global enterprise as a cohesive and focused one LKQ and that will serve as a single guide to ensure we deliver on the promises we hold true for all constituents. The values are development, excellence, leadership, integrity and trust, value-added, embracing change, resourceful and sustainability. Simply put, it spells DELIVERS. Expanding on the word DELIVERS, the one LKQ team across the globe delivered a solid first quarter performance and an outstanding start to 2023.\nDuring the quarter, our 2 largest segments, North America and Europe exceeded our expectations as our teams embraced our operational excellence initiatives. The first quarter of 2023 started the year where 2022 left off, as the resilience of our business shine through a myriad of uncontrollable headwinds ranging from economic softness, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, energy cost spikes and a war in Europe. The continuation of exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American and European segments more than offset the impact of the headwinds experienced by our specialty and self-service segments.\nThe variance in performance across our operating segments this quarter validates our long-term diversification strategy, both with respect to geography and product and speaks to the true strength of our organization and our portfolio of businesses. Now on to the first quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue was $3.3 billion in the first quarter for both 2023 and 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 7.9% on a reported basis and 7.1% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3.3% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by a further 3% for total parts and services revenue increase of 1.5%.\nOther revenue fell 19.2% in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022. Net income was $270 million in Q1 of this year as compared to $269 million last year, as better operating results more than offset the negative impacts related to soft foreign currency exchange rates, higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.\nAdjusted net income was $279 million in Q1 of 2023 as compared to $287 million last year, a decrease of 2.8%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in Q1 of this year compared to $0.94 last year, an increase of 7.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.04 this year as compared to $1 even last year, an increase of 4%. The increases in earnings per share relative to the changes in net income illustrate the positive impact of our historical share repurchase activity.\nLet's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue for parts and services in North America increased 14.4% on a reported basis, a record first quarter performance. North America also reported its highest quarterly segment EBITDA margin on record. Rick will cover the segment level margin details shortly. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision liability-related auto claims were down 4.4% year-over-year in the first quarter.\nOur growth was balanced between price and volume improvements, the latter of which was particularly evident in the aftermarket product line, which was the result of 2 factors: First, having largely worked through the industry supply chain issues and having proper levels of inventory enabled us to get back to our historical level of fulfillment rates. Second, the impact of the State Farm program is unfolding nicely and building demand for aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumper covers. This upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes is consistent with a general rise in APU, which approached prepandemic levels in the first quarter. I am pleased to say that the increase in APU also included an uptick in the recycled parts category, increasing 150 basis points year-over-year. Combined, aftermarket and recycled parts have witnessed nearly a 500 basis point improvement in APU since the first quarter of 2022.\nThe value proposition of alternative parts is gaining share from OEs as insurance carriers face both catastrophic losses from all the storm activity in the quarter and premium pressures as policyholders are tightening up their spending in the midst of an ongoing soft economy. Total loss rates increased slightly in the first quarter to about 19%. But as you can see, it appears that total losses had little to no impact on our organic growth.\nBased on industry research, we expect total loss rates to end the year in the range of 18% to 19% as the market absorbs the recent increase in used car prices as we've entered 2023. Now moving on to our European segment.\nEurope organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 9.7% on a reported basis and 8.2% on a per day basis, which represents the best first quarter per day organic revenue growth since 2016, when we were a much smaller organization and operating in only 6 European countries as compared to over 20 today.\nI'd also like to highlight that Europe's segment EBITDA margin was the highest first quarter level since 2016. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to low double-digit reported organic growth in each of our key operating geographies. In particular, our Benelux, German and Eastern European operations performed exceptionally well. The revenue growth reflected a combination of positive movements in both price and volume. We believe we are continuing to take share in these large and highly fragmented markets.\nThe European team is laser-focused on the cost structure, including rationalizing headcount to create a more nimble and agile team and focusing on a narrow and actionable list of key projects. With that operational focus, the European team delivered the lowest first quarter SG&A level since 2017, notwithstanding a challenging inflationary environment.\nAdditionally, the European team began the integration of the Rhenoy salvage and remanufacturing acquisition that we announced during the last earnings call. In addition, we are ramping up our location count in France with the opening of a distribution center in Marseille earlier this month, bringing our total location count in France to 7. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment.\nDuring the first quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 13%, which was below our expectations. The RV portion of our specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail unit sales of RVs, which are down 57.7% and down 23.7% year-to-date through February, respectively. We expect to see further declines in the RV market as recent industry reports project that full year 2023 wholesale shipments will be down about 34% year-over-year. So we believe that the challenges for our specialty segment will continue throughout 2023.\nAs we work through the balance of the year, our efforts will be focused on the RV repair and service as RV usage rates remain strong and the ongoing growth in light vehicle sales by building the right inventory to service this market space. Truck, off-road and performance parts revenue are also down on a year-over-year basis, but less than what we are seeing in the RV sector. Notably, Specialties Marine business posted organic growth of 10.4% in the quarter, and we are gaining share in this attractive market.\nDespite the industry-wide headwinds and the cyclical nature of this segment, there is no one in the SEMA or RV distribution space that has such a talented team and has the experience and Lean Six Sigma capabilities to effectively manage through a down cycle. Now on to our self-service segment.\nOrganic revenue for parts and services for our self-service segment increased 4.9% in the first quarter. Self-service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing, particularly as it related to precious metals, which manifested itself in a significant drop in the value received for recycled catalytic converters. We believe that the challenges for self-service will persist for the balance of the year as well.\nWhile the rate of inflation is coming down across the globe, inflation continues to impact all of our businesses. Our teams are doing an effective job of getting price relief where possible and are using productivity improvements to offset the negative impact of the increased cost. Regarding labor, our open positions in North America dropped by 20% since year-end, but the challenges with turnover have not abated. The labor market in North America is still overheated and we are pushing wages and selected benefits to combat the issue.\nIn Europe, we are also countering the labor tightness with wage increases to retain our employees and we have maintained low turnover levels in the first quarter. On the corporate development front, as most of you know, on February 27, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares for CAD 48 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately USD 2.1 billion. Uni-Select is a leader in the distribution of automotive refinish and industrial coatings and related products in North America through its FinishMaster segment.\nIn the automotive aftermarket parts business, Uni-Select operates through its Canadian Automotive Group segment up in Canada, and through its GSF Car Parts segment in the U.K. Today is Uni-Select's Special Shareholder Meeting and the final day that its shareholders may cast their votes on the transaction. So we don't yet have a final report. Considering that both ISS and Glass Lewis published reports supporting the transaction and that approximately 20% of Uni-Select shareholders entered into voting agreements to approve the transaction as part of signing of the acquisition agreement back in February. We are highly confident that Uni-Select shareholders will approve the transaction.\nWe have submitted applications for approvals to the various regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. And at this time, all the regulatory reviews are proceeding according to plan. Both the FTC in the United States and the Competitive Bureau in Canada have until May 11, 2023, to determine whether to issue a second request for information. To address any regulatory concerns in the U.K., we have commenced a process to sell Uni-Select GSF car parts business. Our adviser has started the buyer outreach process. And while we can't say much at this time, we are pleased with the initial interest level in the asset.\nUltimately, we hope to receive the required approvals and to complete the Uni-Select acquisition in the second half of this year. Now let's turn to ESG. During the first quarter, we focused our people efforts on various social initiatives and in particular, education for both our employees and importantly, their families as they face the increasing cost of education. Recently, we enhanced 2 existing educational programs available to LKQ employees. The Joseph Holsten Scholarship Fund established over a decade ago provides grants to the children of our employees to assist with post high school educational expenses.\nPrior to 2022, the fund was only available to our North American team, but we expanded the program to include our entire global organization. Our goal is to distribute at least $1 million of scholarships in 2023. Additionally, in Q1 of this year, we increased our North American employee tuition reimbursement program by 100%. Our people are the biggest asset at LKQ and programs like the 2 I just mentioned are critical to enhancing employee engagement, which in turn supports the continued success of our business.\nImportantly, we are honored and proud to be part of the educational development and personal growth of our employees and their families. We look forward to issuing our 2023 CSR before the end of the second quarter, a report that will expand our sustainability disclosures across many aspects of our global enterprise. Lastly, before I turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023, I am pleased to announce that on April 25, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on June 1, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 18.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. We're very pleased with the start to the year as our first quarter results highlight strong revenue growth and profitability. Our 2 largest segments, North America and Europe generated above-expectation revenue growth and margins as our operational excellence initiatives continued to yield benefits.\nThe Specialty and Self-service segments underperformed in the quarter as market conditions continue to produce headwinds for both businesses. Overall, we are pleased with the good start to the year and are on track to deliver on our full year guidance. As discussed on our February call, in Q1, we replaced our prior credit facility, which included a $3.15 billion revolver with a new, unsecured facility, including a $500 million term loan and $2.0 billion revolver. We feel good about the new facility and our ability to fund our operating needs over the next 5 years at a competitive rate structure.\nFree cash flow generation remains solid, noting that the quarterly phasing will be weighted more to the balance of the year than we've seen in the past couple of years when phasing was impacted by the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. The pending Uni-Select acquisition was a source of significant activity during the quarter with due diligence, deal negotiations and post-announcement financing activities. Nick provided an update on the transaction status and I'll highlight the Uni-Select impacts on our first quarter financials.\nTurning now to first quarter results, starting with segment performance. Going to Slide 9. North America continued its strong performance, posting a record first quarter segment EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 240 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 190 basis points, driven by lower freight costs, a favorable mix effect with the sale of the lower-margin PGW business in 2022 and benefits from pricing and productivity initiatives.\nOverhead expenses were flat with lower freight, vehicle and fuel expenses mostly offset by higher charitable contributions. The segment also reported a 50 basis point improvement in other income, mostly related to a nonrecurring settlement of an eminent domain matter. While we believe there will be some moderation in segment EBITDA margin in upcoming quarters as the benefits of the 2022 price increases fall away, the strong start to 2023 has improved our margin outlook to be in the 18s for the year.\nEurope also delivered a strong result with a segment EBITDA margin of 9.7%, up 90 basis points from the prior year. As seen on Slide 10, gross margin was flat, while overhead expenses decreased by 90 basis points with the effects of improved leverage due to the 8.2% per day organic revenue growth and an emphasis on productivity initiatives on personnel costs. We remain optimistic about our previously disclosed expectation for full year margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 11. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 7.9 declined 470 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin was down 320 basis points year-over-year, is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors, discounting to increased sales volumes and unfavorable product mix as low margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions. Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue were up 150 basis points, primarily coming from the decrease in leverage driven by an organic revenue decline of 13.5% per day with impacts on personnel, facility and distribution costs.\nThe macroeconomic headwinds and the resulting effects on RV demand are expected to be an ongoing challenge for specialty, and we're forecasting a full year decrease in both segment EBITDA dollars and margin percentage. As you can see on Slide 12, Self-Service profitability improved sequentially to 13.2% this quarter from 5.2% in the fourth quarter, but decreased by 680 basis points compared to Q1 2022.\nMetals prices had a net negative effect on results with lower precious metals prices more than offsetting lag benefits from sequential steel scrap price increases. Metal revenue decreased by 22.8% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 450 basis points. While car costs typically move in tandem with changes in commodity prices, we have experienced a stickiness in car cost as precious metal prices have declined, which created a gross margin headwind in Q1 that could persist in future quarters.\nOn to the consolidated results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $1.01 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04, the latter of which is $0.04 increase relative to Q4 last year. Our operational performance showed strong year-over-year improvement and was slightly ahead of our expectations as strength in North America and Europe offset underperformance in Specialty and Self-service, reflecting challenging market conditions.\nThe operating improvements resulted in an increase of $0.13 per share on an adjusted basis. We benefited by $0.05 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. These factors more than offset unfavorable year-over-year effects of $0.04 from the impacts of metals prices as shown on Slide 19, $0.04 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding the Uni-Select costs, $0.02 from foreign currency effects caused by the stronger dollar, $0.02 resulting from the divestiture of PGW in Q2 2022 and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate.\nOn the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 26.6%, which is 30 basis points higher than the 26.3% rate in our prior guidance. The rate change is attributable to nondeductible Uni-Select transaction costs and a shift in the geographic distribution of income. As shown on Slide 17, the Uni-Select transaction affected various parts of the first quarter financials. We entered into a bridge loan facility to ensure committed financing was available for the Uni-Select transaction and incurred upfront fees of $9 million.\nInterest expense for the first quarter includes $3 million of amortization of these fees. The remainder will be amortized over the expected term of the facility likely before year-end. Note that we excluded the amortization from adjusted diluted EPS. To hedge the risk related to movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rate between signing and closing, we entered into FX forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at a specified rate. These contracts had a fair value of $23 million as of March 31. And as we are not eligible for hedge accounting on these contracts, the mark-to-market gain is reflected on the income statement as a separate line item.\nNote that this gain is also excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. We incurred M&A advisory costs of $10 million in the quarter, which are presented in restructuring and transaction related costs -- related expenses. Consistent with our historical practice, these costs are excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. We also hedged the risk of movement in interest rates prior to the issuance of permanent financing in the bond market.\nThese interest rate swaps had a negative fair value -- fair market value of $22 million, and these swaps did qualify for hedge accounting. The mark-to-market adjustment was recorded to the balance sheet, and there was no income statement activity in the quarter. We secured a delayed draw 3-year term loan for CAD 700 million that will fund on the day prior to closing.\nShifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. We produced $153 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is in line with our expectations, and we remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $975 million. As mentioned, we expect 2023 cash phasing to be different than in the past few years with higher weighting towards Q2 to Q4. By comparison, in Q1 2022, free cash flow was $350 million, which we indicated was high as a result of timing.\nRecent years were particularly volatile in terms of cash flow timing as inventory levels came in, in 2020 in response to the pandemic-driven market conditions and then were built back up toward normal operating levels in 2021 and '22, where we elected to pay suppliers early to secure delivery of inventories during the supply chain disruptions.\nWe're optimistic supply chain commissions will continue to stabilize in 2023, which should help to smooth some of the cash flow timing volatility going forward. Further impacting the year-over-year comparison, we began to see the projected increase in interest rates, which were $18 million higher in Q1 2022 and capital expenditures up $11 million over the prior year. Income tax payments increased $6 million in the first quarter, and we anticipate a larger uptick beginning Q2 when we have 2 quarterly estimated U.S. federal payments.\nAs of March 31, we had total debt of $2.7 billion with a total leverage ratio of 1.6x EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of below 2x. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 4.7% for the quarter due to the market rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps of 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 2 to 3 years, respectively.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $5 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $74 million. As discussed in the Uni-Select call, we will emphasize debt repayments over share repurchases to reduce total leverage ratio prior to the closing date.\nI will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near March prices and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.08 and the pound sterling at $1.23. We will not include any results for the Uni-Select business until the closing date.\nOur full year guidance metrics on Slide 4 remain unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. We still expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 6% to 8%, organic growth of 7.9% in Q1 includes an extra selling day in Europe, which we will give up in the balance of the year in addition to 1 fewer selling day in North America and Specialty in Q3.\nThe first quarter per day figure of 7.1% is near the midpoint of the range. We still expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20. As I mentioned, North America and Europe are performing ahead of expectations, offsetting the softness in Specialty and self-service, including precious metal prices and the higher effective tax rate.\nThe free cash flow expectation of approximately $975 million and 55% annual EBITDA conversion remain in place, noting that a portion of the Uni-Select transaction fees will have a onetime impact to free cash flow and create a headwind. We will provide a full update on all guidance metrics once the Uni-Select transaction closes. Thanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, LKQ Corp.\n\nThanks, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2023 that again, validated the strength of our strategy, our business model and most importantly, our people. As we continue to progress through 2023, let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. We will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. And we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn gives us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission and our delivers values forward regardless of the challenges.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens."

You may begin your conference.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVP of IR, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and full year 2022, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2023 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks.\nThis month, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of our company's founding in February 1998, which started with a few salvage facilities in the U.S. has grown to a Fortune 300 business with operations in 28 countries and over 45,000 employees providing a wide array of aftermarket and recycled parts used to repair, maintain and accessorize vehicles. Our operations are leaders in their respective markets and are well-positioned to continue their success in the future. Getting to this point has been the result of the dedication of our past and present teams, and I want to express my sincere appreciation for all of these efforts. I am excited to see what this team can deliver in the future as the LKQ team is never satisfied, never rest on its laurels and is always pushing to be the best.\nWhen LKQ was founded, ESG was not the hot topic that it is today, but ESG has always been a vital part of our strategy. Through our recycling operations, we are enabling the circular economy in doing our part to reduce waste. I am proud of our contributions to date, and I can assure you that our emphasis on sustainability will continue to be an integral part of our mission. Our success in ESG is being recognized by external parties. On December 5, 2022, MSCI upgraded LKQ to their highest ESG rating of AAA, placing LKQ in the top 5% of all companies that they rate globally. And on January 31 of this year, LKQ was included in Sustainalytics 2023 top-rated ESG companies list.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 closed a year where the resilience of our businesses shined through a myriad of uncontrollable headwinds ranging from economic softness, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, energy cost spikes and a war in Europe. From an operating perspective, the fourth quarter was a very strong set of results, and I could not be more proud of our team. The continuation of exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American wholesale segment when combined with solid organic revenue growth and the highest fourth quarter EBITDA margins in the history of our European segment offset the impact of the continued headwinds experienced in our specialty and self-service segments. The January revenue trends are similar to the levels generated in the fourth quarter.\nWhile the operations were collectively right on target with the guidance that we provided back in October, the annual tax provision was higher than anticipated, which drove a full year catch-up in the fourth quarter and resulted in quarterly EPS at the low end of the guidance range. Rick will provide more detail on the tax provision in a few minutes.\nNow on to the strong quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3 billion, a decrease of 5.8% as compared to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by FX translation and the divestiture of PGW. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.5% on a reported basis and 5.9% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3.1% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 6.1%, for total parts and services revenue decrease of 4.8%. Other revenue fell 20.1%, primarily due to weaker commodity prices relative to the same period in 2021. Net income in the fourth quarter was $193 million as compared to $235 million for the same period in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.72 as compared to $0.81 for the same period last year, a decrease of 11%.\nDuring the quarter, we had an unfavorable [$0.15] year-over-year impact related to the higher-than-anticipated tax rates. The tax rate was also higher than anticipated during our third quarter call, which generated an unfavorable [$0.05] effect on adjusted diluted EPS relative to our guidance.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $209 million as compared to $254 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 17.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.78 as compared to $0.87 for the same period of last year, a decrease of 10.3%. Net income for the full year of 2022 was $1.14 billion as compared to $1.09 billion for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2022 was $4.11 as compared to $3.66 for the same period of 2021, an increase of 12.3%. Please note that 2022 results include the gain on sale of PGW.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income for the full year of 2022 was $1.1 billion as compared to $1.2 billion for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 9.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $3.85, as compared to $3.96 for the same period of last year, a decrease of 2.8%. Adjusted earnings exclude the gain of the PGW sale, but include the impact of the higher tax rate.\nNow let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 12, organic revenue for parts and services in the fourth quarter for our North American segment increased 10.3% on a reported basis and 12% on a per day basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims were down [0.9%] year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nLooking back at our performance through the financial crisis from 2008 to 2010, our North American business grew organically at an average of 7.5%, which drove the alternative part usage rate or APU rate above its historical annual growth rates. As we enter 2023 and face the reality of a global recession, our alternative parts offerings clearly become more attractive during these challenging economic periods. We are also encouraged by the trend in parts per repair, which reached an all-time high in 2022. Important to note is that our sweet spot has expanded and today stands at model years 4 to 15 years of age. All these items combined positions North America well for continued organic growth in 2023.\nThe upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes and the ongoing improvement in our fill rates continued in the fourth quarter with fill rates reaching their highest percentage levels in 2022 and today stands at close to the pre-pandemic level of 93%. Importantly, as the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, the entire industry realized a 220 basis point improvement in the aftermarket percentage or APU taking share back from the OEs as we progress throughout the year. The supply chain has stabilized and our inventory is generally where we want it to be. The main issue we are confronting today are continued delays at some of the railheads due to congestion.\nAs many of you know, on December 7 of last year, State Farm announced that they are rolling out expanded non-OEM collision repair parts to use in most of the United States. We are excited State Farm is embracing the aftermarket value proposition that the industry offers, which will ultimately benefit the end consumer. We continue to actively analyze this opportunity, and we are well-positioned to compete for our fair share of this opportunity and have built our inventory appropriately to do so. Our salvage inventory is also healthy, and we saw some relief on our cost per vehicle during the quarter. The salvage business had solid organic growth largely driven by price, but as we entered December, we witnessed an upward trend in our salvage volumes.\nTotal loss rates increased a bit in the fourth quarter, which were largely seasonal. And as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth. The slightly higher loss rates played a role in our ability to source the right level of inventory at auction at attractive prices. As we have stated before, fluctuations in loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ.\nMoving on to our European segment. Europe organic revenue growth of parts and services in the quarter increased 4.6% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis, which represents the best fourth quarter per day organic revenue growth since 2016. I'd also like to highlight that Europe's segment EBITDA margin was the highest fourth quarter level since entering the European market in 2011. On a full year basis, Europe's performance is another year of double-digit segment EBITDA margins, which is consistent with our 1 LKQ Europe initiatives and strategy. Rick will cover more margin details in his prepared remarks.\nThroughout the quarter, our European team was laser-focused on the cost structure, including rationalizing headcount to create a more nimble and agile team and focusing our team on a narrow and actionable list of key projects. These projects represent the highest return opportunities that the team can execute in the near-term further cementing the long-term resiliency and market leadership of our European segment.\nOn February 1, LKQ Europe announced that it expanded its European salvage network with the acquisition of Dutch-based Rhenoy Group. Founded in 1991, Rhenoy is a leading supplier of remanufactured engines and recycled OEM car parts. Rhenoy operates a salvage dismantling facility in the Netherlands and remanufacturing plants in both the Netherlands and Poland. As you know, the roots of our company lie in the dismantling of salvaged vehicles to recycle OEM parts. As part of our European strategic plan, we intend to capitalize on that history and knowledge, coupled with our remanufacturing capabilities to grow our salvage network across our European footprint. And with this tuck-in acquisition, we take one small incremental step towards that objective.\nI want to congratulate our STAHLGRUBER team on their 100th anniversary and commend them for building a resilient and market-leading business that continues to demonstrate an ability to adapt to the ever-changing independent aftermarket, a century since founding brothers, Auto and Willy Gruber started the business. Today, the STAHLGRUBER business continues its history of embracing change, which positions them well to capture further opportunity as the car park shifts towards EVs and other forms of mobility. We can't wait to see the next -- what the next 100 years brings for STAHLGRUBER.\nNow let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 10.6% -- throughout 2022, specialty was up against tough 2021 comparisons in the midst of decreased demand for certain key RV parts and a slower-than-expected recovery in U.S. light vehicle sales. Looking at the Specialty segment on a multiyear basis, since 2019, specialty has generated approximately a 4% compound annual growth rate for organic revenue, outperforming the industry growth of SEMA and RV-related products. A few specialty operational highlights would include that specialty continue to realize the full benefits of the sea-wide synergies, which exceeded our expectations in dollars and operational execution and especially one O'Reilly's 2022 [Top] Supply line award for the third year in a row.\nNow under our self-service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our self-service segment increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter. Self-service was again challenged by commodity pricing as seen in the material decline of other revenue, which impacted our expectations for the quarter. On the corporate development front, the fourth quarter was fairly quiet. While we did not complete any material transactions during the quarter, our corporate development team is actively assessing various opportunities that exist across our operating segments. As the global economies continue to soften, that may lead to multiple compression, and we are well-positioned to execute on synergistic acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives.\nOutside of Q4 corporate development efforts, I am pleased to announce that this past January, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with Korea Zinc Company Limited, a world-class general nonferrous metal smelting company. Under the memorandum of understanding, we will work towards a potential large-scale joint venture related to the recycling of lithium-ion EV batteries in the United States. This is again evidence that we will continue to strategically position the company to adapt to and seize the longer-term opportunities that exist in the ever-changing car park.\nTurning to ESG. During the fourth quarter, we continued to build out our ESG program by focusing on our people efforts and various social initiatives. Here are a few worth noting. Every colleague employed by LKQ ELIT Ukraine for at least 6 months, received a onetime hardship payment to support [paying] for energy and the general increase in the cost of living owing to the Russian Invasion. Our U.K. and German operations also implemented onetime hardship payments to support our employees in those markets given the state of the overall European economy. We initiated a voluntary daily pay benefit in the United States that allows our employees to access a portion of their earned pay on demand. The company implemented this benefit with the financial wellness of our people in mind.\nAnd we launched our first employee inclusion group, the LKQ Veterans Network, a program that embraces our proud community of employee veterans and veteran allies who support and encourage each other through shared experiences, veteran recruitment, career development, outward engagement, professional growth and retention.\nIn 2022, our North American salvage operations continued our leadership as the largest recycler of vehicles by processing over 753,000 vehicles resulting in, among other things, the recycling of approximately 3.6 million gallons of fuel, 2.2 million gallons of waste oil, 2 million tires, 700,000 batteries and approximately 955,000 tons of scrap metal. The end result of these efforts resulted in nearly 13 million recycled and repurposed parts being sold into the collision and mechanical repair shop industry that otherwise would have ended up in landfills.\nLet's turn to the inflationary environment, again, a key item of interest for most listeners on this call. As I discussed this time last year, we expected inflation to be a headwind throughout 2022, and that expectation became a harsh reality all year across each of our segments. Fortunately, we are beginning to see some moderation with inflation in the U.S. And recently, we witnessed the rate of inflation drop for the last 3 months in a row across the Eurozone. Eurozone inflation stood at approximately 8.5% in January, down from October, where it was almost 11%. Despite this drop, many of our key operating markets continue to face high inflation rates with certain countries running in the high single to low double digits.\nIn the U.S., the labor markets continue to be strained and unpredictable in the midst of higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession. Daily, we read about high-profile layoffs yet new claims for unemployment benefits remain at a historic low. As of late, wage inflation is beginning to slow in certain areas of our business are seeing reductions in turnover. But these reductions are not material, and we are far from out of the woods, but it is validation that our retention and employee engagement programs are gaining traction.\nOur engagement efforts aren't simply an HR mandate. There are programs that stretch across all levels of the organization and are a key component of our culture. Our global engagement score of 74 is significantly above the average for companies of our size. Studies have shown that employees are engaged are 14% more productive and that companies with engaged employees are 23% more profitable than those with disengaged employees. So from a business perspective, positive employee engagement is critical, but importantly, it's the right thing to do for our most important asset, our people.\nLastly, before I turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results, and discuss our outlook for 2023, I am pleased to announce that on February 21, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of [$0.275] per share of common stock payable on March 30, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2023.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I go into details of the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished in the last year. We entered 2022 with a strong position based on the success of our operational excellence initiatives and solid balance sheet after reporting the highest profitability in the company's history in 2021. We expected there to be headwinds in 2022 from the areas Nick mentioned. As you can see on the bridge on Slide 5, these headwinds did set us back, but the LKQ team drove operational improvements to produce roughly $0.40 of operating increases relative to 2021.\nWe also sustained the positive momentum around cash flow generation with free cash flow of just over $1 billion in 2022, a healthy conversion ratio of 60% of EBITDA. Our work on free cash flow in recent years supported some noteworthy accomplishments in the last year. LKQ achieved investment-grade ratings from all 3 major rating agencies, returned $284 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends and increased the quarterly amount by 10% in October, repurchased roughly 20 million shares of LKQ stock for just over $1 billion, which combined with the carryover benefit from 2021 purchases added $0.23 of EPS compared to 2021 and all while maintaining a net leverage ratio at less than 1.5x EBITDA.\nIn early January 2023, we replaced our prior credit facility, which included a $3.15 billion revolver with a new unsecured facility, including a $500 million term loan and a $2.0 billion revolver. Our confidence in the balance sheet and ability to generate robust cash flow factored into the decision to reduce the size of the facility. We were pleased to complete this new facility ahead of the prior facility becoming current and lock in funding over the next 5 years at a competitive rate structure. Generating these successful outcomes despite challenging conditions is a credit to the entire LKQ team, and I want to thank all of them for their contributions.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter results, starting with segment performance. Going to Slide 14. Wholesale North America continued its strong performance, posting a record fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin of 18.5%, a 330 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 150 basis points, driven by favorable mix and the sale of the lower-margin PGW business as well as pricing and productivity initiatives. Overhead expenses were favorable by 180 basis points, primarily related to nonrecurring expenses incurred in 2021. Strong organic revenue growth, aided by the rebound in aftermarket parts volume offset inflationary cost increases and benefited operating leverage.\nAs mentioned in prior quarters, we believe there will likely be some moderation in segment EBITDA margin in upcoming quarters as the benefits of the 2022 price increases fall away with the resulting EBITDA margin expected to be in the high 17%, low [18%] range for 2023. Europe also delivered its highest ever fourth quarter margin at 10.0%, up 110 basis points from the prior year period.\nAs seen on Slide 15, gross margin improved by 10 basis points as we work to offset inflation with pricing and procurement initiatives. Overhead expenses decreased by 70 basis points with an emphasis on cost structure and improved leverage due to the 5.8% per day organic growth -- revenue growth. Inflation related to personnel, freight and fuel costs remains a critical concern across the European markets. The team is actively addressing the pressures through productivity initiatives. Europe produced a segment EBITDA margin of 10.2% for the full year, the second consecutive year of double-digit margins. I want to commend the Europe team for achieving this result despite the onset of the war on the Ukraine and significant macroeconomic headwinds and we are optimistic about incremental margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 16. Specialties EBITDA margin of 6.2% declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage, driven by an organic revenue decline of 9.1% per day as they anniversary a tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered a 6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter on top of the 17% growth in Q4 2020. Inflationary pressures also pushed overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue higher, including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increase were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and benefits from operating expense synergies, largely generated from the (inaudible) acquisition.\nAs you can see on Slide 17, self-service profitability improved sequentially from the low point in Q3, but remained on the low end of our historical range at 5.2% for the fourth quarter and below our expectations. Metals prices continue to have a negative effect on results with the unfavorable lag effect and reduced operating leverage caused by the lower metals revenue dollars. When we broke out self-service as a separate segment in Q1 2022, we highlighted that this business would have cycles, mostly driven by commodity price volatility. We are working through a down cycle now, and the team is focused on buying the right quantity of cars at the best price to drive margin dollars higher. With the uncontrollable commodity dynamic in this business, we will emphasize generating margin dollars and free cash flow rather than targeting a specific margin percentage.\nNow on to the consolidated results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.72 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.78, which was a $0.09 reduction relative to Q4 last year. As previously mentioned, our operational performance showed year-over-year improvement and was in line with our expectations. However, this solid operational performance was more than offset by unfavorable year-over-year effects of $0.04 from volatility in metals prices and $0.03 from the foreign currency exchange effects caused by the stronger dollar. Additionally, we had a negative effect of $0.03 from higher interest rates as benchmark rates were markedly higher in Q4 2022.\nAs Nick mentioned, taxes were the most significant unfavorable variance for the quarter reflecting a $0.15 year-over-year impact and a $0.05 negative variance relative to the guidance provided back in October. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we recognized almost $0.10 in tax provision benefits from discrete items and the reduction in our full year effective rate. We experienced the opposite effect in Q4 2022 as we recorded a negative provision effect of approximately $0.05 from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items. The effective rate increased primarily related to the shift -- to shifts in the geographic distribution of income.\nWe mitigated about $0.07 of the decline with our lower share count resulting from our share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $11 million in restructuring expenses, the majority of which relate to a new program we kicked off late in the year. We initiated the 2022 global restructuring program in recognition of the ongoing macroeconomic concerns heading into 2023. All of the segments have submitted plans to improve operational efficiencies by streamlining functions closing underperforming locations and halting nonessential projects. The total cost of the 2022 program are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million to be incurred over the next few years. Projected cost savings of $20 million related to the program are included in our 2023 guidance, and we expect annual run rate benefits of approximately $30 million by 2025.\nShifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $166 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.028 billion, the third consecutive year we have exceeded $1 billion. With the supply chain issues abating, we made good progress in rebuilding our inventory levels in wholesale North America and Europe.\nAs shown on Slide 35, we increased our inventory values in these segments. Though note that the dollar increase doesn't directly equate to a quantity change given the higher input costs. We are comfortable with our current inventory holdings and are pleased with improvements in aftermarket fill rates. We will continue to evaluate our inventory holdings and may increase our balances in 2023, but not to the extent seen in 2022. The supply chain finance program contributed to an increase in days payable outstanding in Europe in 2022. With the signing of the new credit facility, certain restrictions around the program were eliminated and we view further program expansion to be an opportunity in the next few years.\nFor the year, the cash conversion is 60% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60%. We finished it at the high end of the range and our guidance partially due to the lower-than-projected capital expenditures. For the year, capital expenditures were 1.7% of revenue, which is below our targeted 2.0% to 2.25% range. We have experienced delays in receiving capital assets such as trucks as a result of supply chain delays. As a result, some of our 2022 orders will be delivered in 2023 and reflected in capital expenditures in the 2023 financials.\nAs of December 31, we had total debt of $2.7 billion with a total leverage ratio of 1.5x EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of below 2x. Please note that going forward, I will reference total leverage statistics rather than net leverage as the new credit facility change the metric to total leverage. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 4% for the quarter due to the market rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt so a 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $18 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $152 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $74 million.\nI will conclude our thoughts on projected 2023 results as shown on Slides 6 through 8. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near December prices and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.08 and the pound sterling at $1.22. We expect organic parts and service revenue growth of between 6% and 8%.\nPlease note that we have 1 fewer selling day in 2023 and have included associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm writing claims on CAPA certified parts in 3 product lines: headlights, tail lights and bumper covers. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 with a midpoint of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.20 or 5% at the midpoint relative to the 2022 actual figure.\nLooking at Slide 7 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2022 actual EPS to our 2023 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.24 relative to the 2022 results, mostly related to wholesale North America from volume growth in Europe due to margin improvement. We do expect a continuation of challenging conditions for specialty from softening demand for RV-related products and self-service related to commodity prices and input cost inflation. Share count benefits are projected to add $0.10 to the full year 2023 EPS over and above the share count benefit associated with the deployment of our PGW proceeds.\nNote that there are no share repurchases assumed for 2023 in this figure. This amount reflects the carryover benefit from 2022 purchases. So we're expecting very solid improvement on the operations side in 2023, which will drive year-over-year growth despite some nonoperational challenges. The exchange rate benefit is nominal and is offset by softening in metals prices. The PGW divestiture creates a $0.02 headwind, reflecting the net reduction caused by lost profits, partly offset by the share count benefit generated from the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases. Interest is projected to be a significant cost increase with our weighted average borrowing rate on variable rate debt having already risen from close to 1% in 2022 to about 4% by year-end. We anticipate an additional $0.13 in interest expense in 2023 on a year-over-year basis due to higher average market rates.\nWe have included an effective tax rate of 26.3% in the 2023 guidance, roughly in line with the final 2022 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $975 million of free cash flow for the year, achieving 55% EBITDA conversion to free cash flow despite a few key headwinds.\nAs seen on Slide 8, we expect to produce incremental cash flows relative to 2022 from operations, including increased profitability and trade working capital improvements to counteract the following uses of cash. First, as mentioned previously, we underspent on capital expenditures in 2022, including equipment delays and expect to see an increase of approximately $78 million relative to the prior year. Second, the higher interest rates will require increased cash payments for interest expense, which we are currently projected at roughly $50 million. Third and final, we anticipate increased tax payments of $60 million due to profitability increases and the timing of payments.\nThanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, 2022 was another banner year for our company and again, validated the strength of our strategy, our business model and most importantly, our people. Let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered the new year.\nFirst, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn gives us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. With these pillars in place, coupled with our industry-leading teams, we are well positioned to both face the challenges the new year presents and to continue to deliver positive year-over-year operating results for our shareholders.\nAs always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission forward regardless of the challenges. Time and time again, our teams have shown that these challenges are opportunities for growth, both for themselves and for the overall organization.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining us on the call to discuss our third quarter results. Last month, we announced a couple of important leadership changes, including Varun Laroyia moving from the CFO chair to become the CEO of our European operations; and Rick Galloway succeeding Varun.\nSince that move happened with just a few weeks left in the quarter, after I provide some high-level comments, Varun and Rick will tag team on the financial details and the updated guidance for 2022. I will then provide some closing comments before opening the call to your questions.\nOnce again, LKQ recorded strong operating results, notwithstanding a very difficult macro environment. The pandemic is still creating challenges, the labor market remains tight and the supply chain is less than optimal, though finally starting to show some signs of improvement.\nThe war continues in Europe and the economies around the globe are showing signs of softness, as many governments try to curb the runaway inflation created by the monetary stimulus utilized to support economies during the early days of the pandemic.\nBut the biggest current headwind is in the foreign exchange market, with the U.S. dollar reaching levels we haven't seen in over 20 years. While we can hedge much of our transactional exposure, with about 46% of our revenue being sourced from our European segment, we cannot hedge the translation exposure. To put things into perspective, the euro and pound sterling fell approximately 7% relative to the dollar during Q3 and have fallen about 15% since the start of 2022.\nThe volatility in exchange rates on a year-over-year basis had a material impact on our reported results during the quarter, reducing revenue by $228 million and adjusted EPS by about $0.07 a share during the third quarter. I believe when you focus on our local currency results, you will agree that our company is performing extremely well, and we are quite pleased to achieve our EPS goals in light of the ongoing and challenging environment.\nThe leadership changes announced in mid-September are moving forward in a seamless manner and clearly demonstrate the depth and breadth of our talent. As discussed in each of the past 3 Investor Day events, talent management has been a key priority for LKQ and the benefits of that focus shine through at times like this. Overall, it was a strong quarterly result, and we continue to be optimistic about the future. Our decision to increase the dividend reflects the confidence that we have in our business.\nNow on to the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $3.1 billion, a decrease of about 5.9% as compared to $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue grew by about 1% to a little over $3.3 billion. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.8%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 2.3%, and the foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 7.4% for a total parts and services revenue decrease of 5%.\nOther revenue fell 17.4% due to changes in commodity prices relative to the same period in 2021. And as a reminder, PGW was included in our third quarter 2021 results. Net income for the quarter was $261 million as compared to $284 million for the same period in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.96 for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 1%.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $266 million as compared to $300 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 11.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.97 as compared to $1.02 for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 4.9%.\nImportantly, please note that FX volatility and lower metals prices collectively created a $0.16 per share headwind in the third quarter of 2022 when compared to the 2021 results.\nNow let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. In North America, organic revenue for parts and services of our North American segment increased 10.9% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, which exceeded our expectations. The impact of divestitures, primarily PGW, reduced revenue by 10.6% in the quarter. This organic growth performance is outstanding when you consider that the industry data suggests that collision liability-related auto claims were up only 2%.\nAlso, North America delivered these results in the midst of decreasing miles driven, which is largely due to the increase in fuel prices. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven decreased 3.3% in July and was up only 0.07% in August. That said, the long-term trends for North America continue to be very favorable. Continued technician shortages will benefit our diagnostics business as shops look to outsource their diagnostic repairs.\nTotal loss rates trending down into the high teens, parts per claim reaching over 12 parts per vehicle, a 20% increase from the third quarter of 2018, and office occupancy hitting nearly a 3-year high, which ultimately lead to more congestion in claims frequency. During the quarter, we were encouraged by the upward trend in our aftermarket volumes. During the quarter, we experienced some relief in the aftermarket supply chain relative to Q2, which translated into an increase in our fill rates.\nThe biggest challenge exists on the domestic side of the supply chain, including the rail carriers and truckers, all of which are out of our control. In talking with several third-party experts, they generally expect these domestic challenges will continue into the first half of 2023. The spot market pricing for containers used in ocean freight has softened immeasurably and our team is laser-focused on active rate reductions from our contracted carriers.\nNow on to our self-service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our self-service segment increased 7.2% for the third quarter. The softness in commodity prices resulted in a decline in other revenue of 24.8%. The soft metal prices also had a significant impact on segment EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. This was anticipated given the lag effect that Varun touched on during our second quarter call.\nMoving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the third quarter increased 4.8% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis. Acquisitions added [0.05%] growth in the quarter, while the exchange rates resulted in a 14.7% decline on a year-over-year basis. I am quite pleased with the organic growth, albeit mostly driven by price in an environment facing high inflation, continued supply chain hurdles and an energy crisis in Europe.\nAll of our European regional platforms recorded strong local currency organic revenue gains with some being in the low double digits. The only decline on a year-over-year basis related to the sale of product to Russian-based jobbers, which as previously mentioned, we completely stopped back in February when the war commenced.\nNow let's move on to our specialty segment. Organic parts and services revenue for specialty declined 9.1% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from Q2, but still down and below our expectations. You may recall, this segment reported 14% organic growth in Q3 of last year. So on a 2-year stack, the annual revenue growth is still positive. The impact of acquisitions had a 6.6% positive impact on revenue growth in specialty, while as a predominantly U.S. business, the exchange rates had a negligible impact.\nDuring the quarter, certain product groups, such as towing that have some exposure to new unit volume, again underperformed in the quarter as the new RV unit sales have decreased year-to-date by over 23% through August. As a reminder, the majority of our RV parts are replacement parts that are not tied to new unit volume but are largely related to the size of the RV park, which is still running at record levels.\nAlso, some of the softness that the SEMA-related products faced in the quarter was due to a year-over-year decrease in light truck and SUV vehicle sales in the United States, an important vehicle category for our specialty offerings. Total U.S. light vehicle sales were flat year-over-year. Importantly, I would like to congratulate our specialty team for receiving the RV Industry Association award as their 2022 Distributor of the Year. This is the second year in a row for this recognition, further validation that our people are truly our greatest asset.\nLet's move on to initial Q4 revenue trends. Revenue for our North America wholesale operations has gone off to a solid start, largely driven by the improvement in aftermarket fill rates, though we don't anticipate we will continue to run at these very high levels, particularly as we lap the pricing movements initiated last year. Our European segment is also witnessing a good start with growth rates continuing at Q3 levels.\nSpecialty revenue is also trending similar to the Q3 performance, and will have easier comps in the fourth quarter compared to the rest of this year. From a corporate development perspective, in the [third] quarter, we divested our Florida shredder. As part of this transaction, we entered into a supply agreement to which our Florida self-service yards will sell or offer to sell its crushed vehicles to the new acquirer. We also divested our equity interest in a small subsidiary of STAHLGRUBER. Neither of these divestitures are material.\nOur employees sit at the center of our ESG efforts, and we are in the process of working through our second employee engagement survey. We just completed surveying all of our North American employees and are in process in Europe. We have a lot of data to analyze, but the North American team had a 93% participation rate.\nOur independent adviser has mentioned this is extremely high for these types of activities and is generally indicative of a high level of engagement across the workforce. I look forward to sharing more on this topic once the process is complete.\nAnd I will now turn the discussion over to Varun and Rick.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. I'm honored to take on the position of CFO of LKQ and I look forward to driving our financial and strategic initiatives to lead the company to even greater success. As part of the North American leadership team, I was heavily involved in rolling out and executing the operational excellence initiatives that have spurred significant improvement in profitability and cash flows over the last few years.\nNow as CFO, I will continue to drive the organization's focus on profitable revenue growth, delivering strong margins and free cash flow generation from this new vantage point. Especially as we face the macroeconomic headwinds Nick mentioned, it will be critical to lean in on productivity and efficiency, and I look forward to partnering with the segment teams to continue to drive this forward.\nTurning now to the consolidated results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.95 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.97, which was a $0.05 reduction relative to Q3 last year. Our operational performance showed year-over-year improvement and was in line with our expectations. However, the solid operational performance was more than offset by unfavorable effects of $0.09 from volatility in metals prices and $0.07 from foreign currency exchange effects caused by the stronger dollar.\nAdditionally, we had negative effects of $0.06 in total from, one, divesting the PGW business in Q2; two, higher interest rates; and three, a 20 basis point increase in the effective tax rate to 25.5%. We mitigated about $0.07 of the decline with the lower share count resulting from our share repurchase program.\nShifting to segment performance. Much of the operational improvement in the quarter came from the wholesale North American segment. Going to Slide 10, the segment EBITDA margin of 19.4% is a record for the third quarter. We saw strong gross margin improvement of 190 basis points with a little over half from pricing and productivity initiatives and the remainder from the mix with the sale of the low-margin PGW business.\nOverhead expenses were favorable by 20 basis points, primarily related to nonrecurring expenses from Q3 2021. We're very pleased with the way wholesale is performing. And while we believe wholesale will continue to generate strong margins, there will likely be moderation in the upcoming quarters as we move towards the long-term expectation we presented at Investor Day earlier this year.\nOn the Q2 call in July, we noted that self-service would face difficult conditions in Q3. And as expected, self-service had a tough quarter with roughly breakeven segment EBITDA and a 2.6% margin. With scrap metals prices falling, we experienced a negative lag effect as we turn the cars purchased in the second quarter when metals prices were higher at lower scrap prices. We added a slide to the presentation to depict this effect.\nLooking at Slide 29, you can see the delta between the average scrap metals price in Q2 of $279, which influenced the amount we paid for the cars purchase and the current quarter average of $198, which drove the amount we received when scrapping the Q2 cars we purchased. We wanted to provide this depiction to help provide more clarity on the lag effect. But caution, there isn't a perfect correlation between scrap steel prices and car costs as other market conditions will impact the purchase price of the cars.\nThe reduction in prices, along with lower volume processed in Q3 produced the decrease in gross margin and the negative leverage effect on overhead costs. We expect improved sequential profitability in Q4 as we cycle through most of the higher cost Q2 purchases by the end of September. I will turn the call to Varun to cover the other segments as well as cash flows and the balance sheet.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nCEO & MD of LKQ Europe, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick. Appreciate that introduction and the overview of the North America wholesale and self-service segment's performance.\nLet's move to Slide 11 of the earnings deck. Europe delivered an 11.3% EBITDA margin for the quarter, down 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points as we worked to offset inflation with procurement initiatives and pricing. Overhead and other expenses increased by 30 basis points with inflation weighing primarily on personnel, freight and fuel costs. The segment's solid third quarter performance reinforces our expectation that we will deliver a double-digit margin for the full year despite the macroeconomic headwinds around general inflation, energy cost and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nWhile I have been in my new role as CEO of the European segment for a little over a month, I have gotten an opportunity to get an on-the-ground view of our operations and the management team. And I am even more impressed by the strength of our frontline businesses. And despite the darkening macroeconomic clouds, with judicious and decisive prioritization, I am confident that we can achieve our long-term operational and financial target.\nMoving on to Slide 12. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 10.8% declined 30 basis points compared to the prior year, coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage, driven by an organic revenue decline of 9.1% as we anniversary a tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered a nearly 14% organic revenue growth rate in the third quarter.\nInflationary pressures also pushed overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue higher, including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increases were partially offset by a 70 basis point benefit from lower incentive compensation and 80 basis points of benefits from operating expense synergies largely generated from the SeaWide acquisition of a year ago.\nShifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced a healthy $224 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $862 million. We have made good progress in rebuilding our inventory levels in wholesale North America and in Europe. As shown on Slide 32, we increased our inventory values in these segments, though please note that the dollar increase doesn't directly equate to a quantity change given the higher input costs.\nUsing North America aftermarket as an example with higher per unit costs, i.e. inventory balance in dollar terms, is close to Q4 of 2019 and while the total available quantity on hand is down approximately 20%. We still have some work to do to optimize inventory on hand, especially going into the busier winter season. So we expect further fine-tuning of inventory levels over the balance of the year.\nThrough September, the cash conversion ratio is 64% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, just above our target range of 55% to 60%. There continues to be timing elements that will reverse over the course of the year. For example, the third quarter inventory build will result in higher outflows for payables in the fourth quarter, and we are confident in our ability to generate sustainable free cash flow in line with our expectations.\nAs of September 30, we had net debt of $2.2 billion with a net leverage ratio of 1.3x EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of being below 2x. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 3% for the quarter and with the effect of rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.6 billion in variable rate debt, so a 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $16 million.\nAs you can imagine, we are evaluating our fixed versus floating rate mix as part of a larger review of our capital structure and credit facility, which matures in approximately 15 months, and we expect to complete this assessment shortly. Most of our transactions are conducted in the home entities functional currency. For example, buying inventory for our U.S. locations in U.S. dollars or European entities borrowing funds in local currency to create a natural operating hedge.\nAs a result, our currency exposure is weighted to translation of foreign currency-denominated results into U.S. dollars rather than transaction gains and losses. Where we have transaction exposures, we hedged through forward contracts. We are comfortable with our current approach to managing foreign exchange risk, though we are monitoring market conditions to determine if a change in strategy is required.\nWith our strong free cash flow and the proceeds from the PGW Glass sale earlier this year, we have been able to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in 2022. We repurchased over 17 million shares or $891 million through September, including almost 7 million shares for $343 million in the third quarter.\nAdditionally, we paid quarterly dividends totaling $210 million year-to-date. We had approximately [$260] million available on the previous board share repurchase authorization as of September 30, and we have remained active in the market in October with a further $119 million purchase through last Friday. Earlier this week, our Board authorized a $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program for a total authorization of $3.5 billion and extended the term through October of 2025.\nWe are pleased to have this program expansion to be able to continue to use share repurchases as part of our balanced capital allocation strategy. As our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board also approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share which will be paid on December 1 to stockholders of record as of November 17. This reflects a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend.\nBefore I turn the call back to Rick, I would like to take a moment to thank LKQ's leadership team, our global finance organization and all our dedicated employees across the organization. It has truly been a great privilege to serve as your CFO over these last 5 years.\nOver that time, the company has achieved tremendous things with significant growth in profitability and free cash flow, building a rock-solid, fortress-like balance sheet and generating robust shareholder returns. I truly appreciate everyone's efforts to reach this point, and I feel honored to have been a part of the team during this pivotal period.\nNow we need to leverage our strengths to become even more successful. I leave the finance organization in Rick's capable hands, and I look forward to working with him in my new role. With that, Rick, back to you.\n\nRick Galloway\n\nSenior VP & CFO, LKQ Corporation\n\nThanks, Varun. I'm also looking forward to working with you in this new capacity.\nI will conclude with our updated thoughts on projected 2022 results shown on Slide 6. Our guidance is based on current conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near September prices and the Ukraine-Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven.\nOn foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with the balance of the year rates for the euro of $0.97 and the pound sterling at $1.11 versus $1.02 and $1.20 in the previous guidance, effectively a 5% and 7.5% decline. We narrowed the organic parts and service growth range to 4.75% to 5.75% with the midpoint up slightly from our year-to-date growth at 5.1%. Please note that we have 1 fewer selling day in Q4 this year.\nWe are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.85 to $3.95, with a midpoint of $3.90. We have narrowed the range as we are 3 quarters through the year and lowered the midpoint of our prior guidance by $0.05. To understand why we reduced the midpoint, please refer to Slide 7 in the presentation, which bridges our prior and current guidance figures.\nOperating performance remains solid and represents upside of $0.02 relative to our prior guidance. The frontline businesses continue their resilience in difficult conditions. Capital allocation is also a benefit of $0.03 relative to our prior guidance primarily related to higher repurchase volume. Note that we are including share repurchases through the week ended October 21 in our guidance. That's the good news, generally tied to the areas under our control.\nThen there are the negatives, which are primarily external factors. Declining metals prices are projected to have a negative $0.04 effect. Headwinds from the weakening FX rates mentioned earlier, contribute a $0.03 reduction relative to prior guidance and unless the trend reverses will be a negative factor in 2023. Taxes and interest drive another $0.03 negative effect, including the rate changes previously noted. FX rates and metals prices can move significantly over time. We may have further upside or downside if the actual figures play out differently than we assume in our guidance.\nWe expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, achieving free cash flow conversion in line with our expectations for the business. Translation of foreign currency denominated cash flows will have a negative effect, given the lower euro and pound sterling rates used in our latest estimates, but we are still anticipating 55% to 60% EBITDA conversion to free cash flow adjusted for the PGW gain.\nThanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick and Varun, for that financial overview. Let me restate our key initiatives, which are central to our culture and our objectives. First, to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, to drive high levels of cash flow which in turn give us the flexibility to maintain our balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, as always, to continue to invest in our future.\nAs you can see from our results, we are committed to driving these metrics forward regardless of the operating environment. Our teams across all of our segments are executing on their operational targets, and they have done a tremendous job during these unpredictable and unique times.\nWith respect to the items we can't control such as FX rates, the supply chain and labor market constraints, we don't have a crystal ball, but it appears we will be confronting these uncontrollable items as we enter 2023. That said, I am confident our operational excellence efforts can navigate and effectively manage most any challenge. Why? Simply stated, we have the best teams in each of our segments and the industry and their track record over the last 3 years speaks for itself.\nAnd for that, I offer a tremendous thank you to our team members across the globe that make it happen each and every day. They define what it means to be LKQ proud. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Boutross, you may begin your conference.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVP of IR, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments relative to our performance in the quarter and then Varun will dive into the financial details and provide an update on our guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks.\nThe second quarter of 2022 was one of the most unusual and complicated operating environments we've encountered maybe ever, but clearly, since the financial crisis. During the quarter, we were confronted with ongoing COVID risk and the issues associated with an uptick in positive cases in our workforce.\nMajor labor constraints, ongoing supply chain disruptions, a challenging inflationary environment globally as evidenced by June being the highest level of inflation the United States have seen in some 40 years. Soaring energy prices, commodity price volatility, the unfortunate conflict in Ukraine and political unrest across the globe. And all this has resulted in major volatility in the foreign exchange markets with the euro weakening materially in the quarter and reaching parity with the dollar in July.\nI think I speak for all CEOs across all industries when I say the sheer number of cross currents and headwinds have created some very challenging business dynamics. Yet, the LKQ team delivered another quarter of solid performance, driven by excellent focus and execution, exceeding many expectations, both internally and externally. I am very proud of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by our 45,000 employees that enabled our company to deliver on behalf of our stockholders and our customers during the quarter.\nI am equally proud of the team's commitment to effectively immense the dynamics of our business, which they can control, while not losing focus on growing the business, developing our people and continuously looking for opportunities to generate leverage and synergies across our operating segments. This effective management will serve the company well as we progress through the balance of 2022 and continue to confront many of the same headwinds. Our confidence in our team's ability to manage through this environment is validated by the reaffirming of our 2022 guidance, which Varun will discuss shortly.\nNow on to the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 2.7% as compared to $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Parts and services organic revenue increased 3.8% on a reported basis and 4.2% on a per day basis.\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 1%, and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 5.6% for total parts and services revenue decrease of 2.7% on a reported basis or 2.4% on a per day basis. Other revenue fell 2.9%, driven by a decline in precious metal prices.\nNet income for the quarter was $420 million as compared to $305 million for the same period of last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.49 as compared to $1.01 for the same period of 2021, an increase of 47.5%. These amounts reflects a $127 million gain on sale of the PGW Glass business in April or $0.45 a share.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income in the quarter was $307 million as compared to $340 million for the same period of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.09 as compared to $1.13 for the same period last year, a 3.5% decrease. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the PGW sale.\nNow let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. In North America, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 10.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, which exceeded our expectations. This performance confirms the resiliency of our business model and our team's ability to effectively implement pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures.\nAs it relates to volume, during the quarter, we saw some weakness, which was consistent with a 2.6% decrease in second quarter fuel consumption as measured by the U.S. Department of Energy. Additionally, vehicle miles traveled saw a little year-over-year growth, and Q2 growth was down relative to Q1.\nThe largest pressure point in North America continues to be the aftermarket collision parts product line, which experienced reduced year-over-year volumes due to lower [performance] rates associated with the supply chain disruptions.\nDuring the quarter, we benefited from some minor relief in the aftermarket supply chain relative to Q1, which translated into a very modest increase in our fill rates, with June aftermarket fill rates reaching the highest levels of 2022. While we are still well below historical levels, we are encouraged by this modest positive trend in the supply chain, which is also evidenced by the decrease of spot container costs the market witnessed during the quarter, albeit the shipping costs are still multiples above pre-pandemic levels.\nDuring the quarter, we were successful in getting a higher level of aftermarket collision parts shipped from Taiwan, but most all of that inventory is still on the water and won't be received in our warehouses until late summer or early fall.\nOur salvage collision part volumes were up a bit compared to last year as we were able to shift some of the aftermarket demand over to recycled parts. Recycled and remanufactured mechanical part volumes were generally flat on a year-over-year basis.\nThe value proposition of alternative parts could not be more attractive that insurance carriers base loss pressures from increased parts cost, rising labor cost and technician shortages at the repair shops, broader supply chain issues and decreased availability and increased cost of rental cars.\nDuring the quarter, collision repair costs increased 11.6% year-over-year with cycle time still being over double their historical averages. Recently, the value proposition of CAPA Certified Aftermarket Parts is being recognized by the largest auto insurer in the United States, that being State Farm through a small pilot program.\nOn June 20, State Farm began an 8-week program where it introduced aftermarket bumper covers, headlights and taillights when preparing repair estimates and settling auto claims in the Oklahoma and Texas markets. As you all know, State Farms historically has not utilized the aftermarket collision parts.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of the pilot or estimate how this will impact State Farm's parts strategy going forward and neither should you. That said, as with many things, the first test is the widest and the tallest and we're cautiously optimistic that aftermarket parts could potentially become a larger portion of State Farm's parts spend over the long term, as they work through the outcomes of this pilot program.\nMoving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 4.2% on a reported basis and 4.9% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continued to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but every geographic market was positive year-over-year with our Benelux, U.K., Central and Eastern European and salvage businesses being the top performers. Importantly, Italy realized year-over-year growth, which reflected the second consecutive quarter of positive revenue performance in that region.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we halted all sales of parts into Russia when the war commenced. This decision reduced same-day organic growth for the European segment during the second quarter by approximately 1.5% to 1%. Excluding the impact of the lost Russian revenue, same-day organic growth in Europe was 5.4%. When taken as a whole, the European volumes were down a bit during the quarter, but pricing was strong. We continue to make great progress with our 1 LKQ Europe Program. Alongside solid organic growth during the quarter, our European segment achieved double-digit segment EBITDA margins which represented incremental improvements, both sequentially and year-over-year. Our European teams focus on pricing actions, private label branding and procurement initiatives generated positive results in the quarter.\nAs I've said before, the execution element of the 1 LKQ Europe program will be with us forever, and it will be the driving factor behind the productivity improvements in years to come. Given all the current operating challenges in Europe, including the foreign exchange and geopolitical dynamics, I am very pleased with Europe's performance in the quarter.\nNow let's move on to our specialty segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for specialty declined 11.5% in the quarter, largely due to a tough year-over-year comp. As you may recall, this segment reported 30% organic growth in the second quarter of last year. So on a 2-year stack, the annual revenue growth is still well into double digits. Indeed, specialty revenue in the second quarter would have been a record for the team, if not for the buoyant performance in 2021.\nOur RV parts category performed better than the segment level growth as a whole during the quarter, as demand for the majority of our RV parts offerings is driven more by the size of the RV part and not new RV unit volume. That said, certain product groups such as towing that have some exposure to new unit volume, underperformed in the quarter. Also, some of the softness that the SEMA-related products based in the quarter was due to a year-over-year decrease in light vehicle sales in the U.S. In particular, pickup truck sales were down nearly 12% in the quarter, an important vehicle category for our specialty offerings.\nNow on to self service. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment increased 13.2%. There were some softness towards the end of the quarter in precious metals prices, which also impacted segment EBITDA margins year-over-year. Self service also had increased vehicle procurement costs as we were challenged to source inventory. The recent volatility in commodities further validates the rationale for breaking out this nondistribution Self Service business as a separate segment, given it represents the vast majority of the other revenue category.\nLet's move on to the initial Q3 revenue trends. Revenue for North America wholesale operation have gotten off to a solid start, though we don't anticipate it will continue at the double-digit growth rates experienced in the first half of the year. Our European segment is also witnessing a good start, with growth rates continuing at second quarter levels. Lastly, specialty revenue is slowly trending back towards prior year levels now that it has lapsed the incredibly strong growth rates experienced in the first half of 2021.\nWe are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions across all of our segments. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures. While supply chain challenges are also driving cost inflation across all our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these higher costs, as witnessed by our margin performance.\nAlongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure that we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract. Our focus on the total rewards received by LKQ employees, not just compensation, is helping us navigate the difficult labor markets.\nFrom a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired 4 businesses. In the United States, we acquired Bumblebee Batteries, another EV battery remanufacturing operation. In Europe, we acquired a workshop concept in The Netherlands, 2 very small former Hess Automotive branch locations in Germany and the equity interest of our former JV partner in a small aftermarket parts business in Germany. In addition to closing on the sale of our PGW business during the quarter, we also divested our equity interest in 2 small joint ventures.\nLastly, on the ESG front, on May 23, we released our 2021 Sustainability Report and unveiled our new brand identity, reflecting the company's transformation from a salvage dismantler and recycler to a leading global value-added and sustainable distributor of vehicle parts accessories and services. LKQ is widely known and respected for our environmental stewardship. But within our 2021 CSR, we provided a deeper understanding of our social impact initiatives and strong governance structure, both of which underpin the long-term strength and success of our business.\nThis year's report is another step in evolving our holistic ESG focus across our global organization with new and robust disclosures and accomplishments. Also during the quarter, 50/50 Women On Boards, a leading education and efficacy campaign driving the movement towards gender balance and diversity on corporate Boards recognized LKQ as a 3-plus company. This award acknowledges our efforts in understanding the importance and advantages of having a diverse Board that ultimately benefit stockholders, customers, employees and communities.\nAnd I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong second quarter financial performance.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. I'm excited to be able to report that we carried the momentum generated by our operational excellence initiatives through the second quarter and produced another strong set of financial results.\nAs Nick described, there is a great deal of volatility in the market related to inflation, supply chain challenges, exchange rate fluctuations and commodity price movements on top of the geopolitical events and the ongoing pandemic. All these factors could easily have become a distraction and taken our focus away from executing on our operational priorities. I'm proud to say that the LKQ team did not let that happen, and our second quarter results reflect this ability to stay on point.\nLet me start with some highlights of the last quarter. As we announced in June, Moody's became the final of the 3 rating agencies to assign LKQ an investment-grade rating following previous upgrades by Fitch and S&P. We believe that we've taken the right actions over the last 3 years to strengthen our credit profile, and the Moody's upgrade to Baa3 with a stable outlook is further validation of our strategy. As discussed last quarter, achieving an investment-grade rating opens opportunities to improve free cash flow over the upcoming years, in addition to the immediate drop-off in the leans to the credit facility following the covenant suspension.\nWith respect to free cash flow, we produced a healthy $288 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to $638 million, and importantly, putting us on pace to achieve our full year guidance of $1 billion. I'm pleased that we were able to build our inventory towards the optimal level as shipping congestion eased a little bit which resulted in a net cash outflow for the quarter of $162 million on this specific account.\nStrong free cash flow, along with the proceeds from the PGW Glass sale allowed us to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. We repurchased over 8 million shares for $404 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $70 million.\nIn just the last 12 months, we have repurchased over 20 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion and paid $215 million in dividends. In May, our board authorized a further $500 million increase to our share repurchase program to a total of $2.5 billion being authorized. We had about $600 million available as of the end of June, and we have remained active in the market in July.\nAs previously stated, in April, we completed the sale of the PGW aftermarket glass distribution business for gross proceeds of $361 million. We recognized a pretax gain on sale of $155 million or $127 million after tax. Our U.S. GAAP EPS reflects the $0.45 gain, though we have deducted the gain from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS.\nI'll now shift to the quarterly results. As expected, and previously communicated, precious metal prices were a drag on results year-over-year, generating a $32 million negative effect on segment EBITDA and an $0.08 headwind on adjusted diluted EPS. Most of the impact related to the precious metals found in catalytic converters, the prices of which were near record levels in the second quarter of 2021, roughly $20 million of the negative effect was reflected in the Self Service segment.\nExchange rates created a further headwind as the average rate for the euro and pound sterling decreased by 12% and 10%, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2021. The currency impact reduced segment EBITDA by $20 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.04 relative to last year. And finally, not having the PGW business for the full quarter was a further $12 million headwind to segment EBITDA versus the prior year.\nKeeping those external factors in mind, our second quarter results reflect a solid operating performance, while gross margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to a year ago, a 70 basis point negative effect came from the metals prices alone. Benefits in pricing and mix partially offset the metals impact.\nOverhead expenses, as a percentage of revenue, rose 60 basis points year-over-year due to inflationary pressures. Income taxes were booked at 25.3% for the year-to-date period, a 20 basis point increase over our prior guidance, reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of U.S. dollar earnings, as impacted by the significant shift in FX rates since we spoke 90 days ago. As Nick mentioned, diluted EPS was $1.49 for the quarter, including the $0.45 PGW gain and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.09.\nI'll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 8. Wholesale North America produced an EBITDA margin of 18.7% for the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points. Inflationary increases in material and freight costs were offset by higher parts pricing and productivity initiatives. Segment overhead expenses were roughly flat owing to lower personnel costs from incentive compensation and productivity initiatives to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nEurope reported a 10.8% EBITDA margin for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year period. As you'll see on Slide 9, gross margin improved by 80 basis points, primarily from procurement initiatives and pricing. Overhead expenses increased by 60 basis points from higher personnel, freight and fuel costs. The segment's strong second quarter performance reinforces the team's expectation that they will deliver a double-digit margin for the full year.\nMoving to Slide 10. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 13.4% declined 150 basis points compared to the prior year, mostly coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage, driven by an organic revenue decline of 11.5%, as the anniversary a very tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered over 30% organic revenue growth in the first and second quarters of 2021. Inflationary pressures also grew overhead expenses higher including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of benefits from operating expense synergies, mostly generated from the SeaWide acquisition.\nTo provide some context to the segment's performance, pre-pandemic in Q2 of 2019, specialty reported a margin of 12.7%. Since then, the team has made great progress on pricing and productivity, resulting in a 70 basis point improvement from the second quarter of '19 through to Q2 of 2022, in addition to growing the business by over $100 million in revenue.\nMoving to self service. Self service reported an EBITDA margin of 15.3% for the second quarter of 2022, a solid result for the segment, but below the heightened margin achieved a year ago. The decrease in self service's margin in Q2 of 2022 was driven by movements in metal prices estimated as an 840 basis point negative effect year-over-year, higher car costs and inflationary increases related to freight, fuel and personnel expenses. The third quarter will be markedly tougher for the segment as the higher car costs from the second quarter cycle through in a significantly lower pricing environment for metals before stabilizing in the fourth quarter.\nI touched on liquidity and capital allocation in the highlights, so I'll reference a few other items of note. As shown on Slide 13, our year-to-date conversion ratio of free cash flow to EBITDA is roughly 70%, noting that the glass proceeds and the gain on sale are not reflected in these figures. There continue to be timing elements that will reverse over the course of the year, and we are confident in our ability to generate sustainable free cash flow in line with expectations of converting EBITDA to free cash flow in the 55% to 60% range for the full year.\nWe have made further progress in rebuilding our inventory levels to achieve our fill rates targets. As you can see on Slides 31 and 32, we have increased inventory in 3 of our 4 segments since December 2021. Specialty was flat through December, but was in a stronger position than our other segments and thus hasn't required a similar inventory build. We remain confident that our inventory positions will enable each segment to continue to offer best-in-class availability and service reliability relative to our competitors.\nMoving on to capital allocation. We paid down our debt balance by $248 million in the quarter. Our net leverage ratio came in at 1.2x EBITDA and interest coverage exceeds 30x. It's worth noting that our net leverage ratio of 1.2x is in line with the June 2021 figure despite the use of $1.3 billion for share repurchases and dividend payments over the last 12 months. As our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which will be paid on September 1 to stockholders of record as of August 11.\nI will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on projected 2022 results. Our guidance assumes there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets. Scrap and precious metal prices hold near average June prices and the Ukraine-Russia conflict does not escalate further.\nOn foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with the balance of year rates for the euro of $1.02 and the pounds sterling at $1.20.\nStarting with the revenue outlook. We remain comfortable with our revenue outlook and are holding our organic parts and services growth range between 4.5% and 6.5%. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.85 up to $4.05 with a midpoint of $3.95. We have narrowed the range as we are halfway through the year, but maintained the midpoint of our prior guidance. To understand why we held the midpoint, please refer to Slide 18 in the presentation, which bridges our prior and current guidance figures.\nWe generated operational benefits in the second quarter and expect further upside in the second half of the year. The total operational improvement is $0.11, which highlights the resilience of the business in difficult trading conditions. While the Ukraine-Russia conflict is still a negative on a full year basis, we have seen better-than-expected results as areas of the country reopen with fighting concentrated in the eastern part of Ukraine. We are honored to be able to support critical mobility needs in the country where feasible and are very proud of the work being done by our colleagues in Ukraine.\nCapital allocation is also a benefit of $0.03 relative to our prior guidance, primarily related to timing. Note that we are including share repurchases through the week ended the 22nd of July in our guidance and as in prior periods, not assume any further retail purchases for the balance of the year.\nThat's the good news, mostly tied to the areas directly under our control. And then there are other negatives, which are primarily external factors. Headwinds from the weakening FX rates, I mentioned earlier, contributed a $0.06 reduction relative to prior guidance. Declining metals prices are expected to have an additional negative $0.07 impact primarily in the third quarter as we turn cars purchased in the first and second quarters when metals prices were higher at a lower projected scrap and precious metal prices. FX rates and metals prices can move significantly over time. We may have further upside or downside if the actual figures play out differently than we have assumed in our guidance.\nAnd finally, we remain on track to deliver at least $1 billion of free cash flow for the year achieving strong free cash conversion in line with our expectations for the business. We haven't increased the minimum, given the negative exchange rate effects and the projected tax payment for the PGW gain, which, in the aggregate, are estimated to be approximately $50 million. We expect to overcome both factors to meet or exceed the $1 billion estimate.\nThank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Varun, for that financial overview. Let me restate our key initiatives, which are central to our culture and our objectives. First, integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, to continue to invest in our future.\nAs you can see from our results, we are committed to driving these metrics forward regardless of the operating environment. We are doing our very best to effectively manage the items which are under our control so as to offset the headwinds which are largely outside of our control. And for that, I offer a tremendous thank you to our team members across the globe that make it happen each and every day. They define what it means to be LKQ proud.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation, you may begin your conference.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVP of IR, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. .\nPlease refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.\nNow let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation.\nHopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone.\nI will provide some high-level comments on what was a robust quarter for LKQ from many different perspectives before Varun walks you through some of the financial details and our increased financial guidance. I will then close with a few observations before opening the call to your questions.\nAs we entered 2022, who would have thought the world would experience events more traumatic than the pandemic we all have been living through? Just when everyone thought we had turned the corner and we're headed towards the new normal, in late February, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, and everything changed overnight. In retrospect, issues related to tight labor markets, supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures pale in comparison to the needless loss of human lives. Yet out of the ashes, we are all able to watch the evening news and see true leadership and courage in action and incredible solidarity in a time of crisis. Yes, I'm talking about the Ukrainian people.\nBut the same is true for the 950 people in Ukraine who are LKQ associates. These employees are truly remarkable. So too are their colleagues in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania who welcomed hundreds of family members of our Ukrainian employees at the border to provide food, housing, medical assistance and schooling to those fleeing the country. They are all defining what it means to be LKQ proud.\nAs to the business, we exceeded our expectations for Q1 in terms of both revenue and profitability. And this gives us confidence to increase our financial guidance for the year. The key word in the economy in the past several quarters has been inflation. During periods like this, companies have a choice, wait and see the impact and play defense or anticipate the impact and play offense. LKQ chose to play offense, and the benefits of doing so can be found in our results. This is particularly true with respect to the exceptional organic revenue growth achieved in our North American wholesale and European segments. Both of which benefited from strong demand for automotive products as mobility and claims volumes increased, while pushing prices in an attempt to offset most of the inflationary pressures.\nManaging through this environment is hard. And I am extremely thankful for the efforts of the global LKQ leadership team, which is doing a terrific job of balancing the best interest of our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.\nNow on to the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% as compared to $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Total parts and services revenue increased 5.9% in Q1, comprised of organic revenue increases of 6.9%, plus the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 1.7%, offset by foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenue by 2.7%. Net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $269 million as compared to $266 million for the same period of 2021, an increase of 1.1%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.94 as compared to $0.88 for the same period last year, an increase of 6.8%. On an adjusted basis, net income in the first quarter of 2022 was $287 million compared to $286 million in the same period of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $1 as compared to $0.94 for the same period of 2021, a 6.4% increase, driven by a reduction in the average share count.\nLet's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. And please note, this is the first quarter of separating the self-service business from the core North American wholesale business.\nTurning to North America. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services in our North American wholesale segment increased 13.6% in the quarter on a reported basis and 11.8% on a per day basis. During the first quarter, industry-wide overall claim counts increased 12.2% versus Q1 of 2021. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, during the first quarter of 2022, U.S. weekly supplied motor gasoline volume was approximately 4.9% above last year, but still 4.7% below the first quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic. And according to the Department of Transportation, highway miles driven during Q1 increased 4.9% above last year, but lagged 2019 levels by approximately 2.2%.\nFrom a product line perspective, recycled and remanufactured parts demonstrated higher growth, including gains in both volumes and price relative to last year. On the aftermarket front, we have been successful in passing through inflationary cost increases despite the supply chain challenges, which are causing volumes to be down relative both to last year and 2019.\nApril has started off on a positive note, following the pattern established in Q1. We don't anticipate achieving double-digit revenue growth in our North America wholesale operation for the rest of the year, but we expect it to be in the mid- to high single-digits.\nIn part due to headwinds from parts availability and more so due to labor constraints, during Q1, the national average scheduling backlog at collision repair shops reached 4.5 weeks, 2.5x the length of the typical first quarter backlog. Additionally, since 2016, average vehicle repair costs have risen steadily every year with the largest increases occurring in the past 2 years, reaching an all-time high in 2021. Our parts provide a strong solution for shops and insurance carriers to manage costs. As we inevitably begin to witness some relief in the supply chain and a steadier flow of aftermarket product, the value proposition of our parts becomes even more attractive as shops continue to face headwinds related to labor costs and overall inflation.\nAs we indicated in our last call, this quarter, we began reporting self-service as a separate segment. This new segment provides investors with greater transparency into the commodities dynamic of our business. Given the majority of our other revenue category, which primarily consists of scrap and precious metals, comes from our self-service operations. Varun will cover more details on the margins of this segment shortly.\nDuring the first quarter, total revenue for self-service was flat compared to last year reflecting the relative softness in metals pricing. Organic revenue for parts and services for this segment increased 14.6%, largely driven by price. Also, the average revenue per admission, a key productivity metric rose during the first quarter of 2022 relative to 2021.\nMoving to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the first quarter increased 6.9% on a reported basis and 6% on a per day basis. As the largest pure-play distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in Europe, this is a tremendous start to 2022 even in the face of an extremely challenging geopolitical environment on the continent. So we are quite pleased with the organic growth in Europe.\nWhile different by market, overall consolidated organic growth was split evenly between volume and price. According to the Apple Mobility Index, the trends in driving trips in our European markets was down earlier in the year due to normal seasonal patterns. As we progress through Q1, the index rebounded. Encouragingly, despite all the fear of a dramatic drop-off in demand due to global macro headlines, at this point we have not seen any notable shift in European mobility as we've entered the second quarter.\nOur regional operations experienced varying revenue performance in the quarter, but all posted positive growth with very solid year-over-year performance. The U.K. and Benelux operations were particularly strong with high single-digit organic growth, while Germany and Central Europe, excluding Ukraine, posted mid-single-digit organic growth. Italy also demonstrated progress, posting positive organic growth for the first time in several quarters.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine had a direct impact on our revenue in late February and all of March due to having to close certain branches that we operate in Ukraine. And those that have remained open, as you would assume saw a significant drop in demand. Also, immediately following the invasion, we ceased all sales to Russian-based parts distributors. We estimate the impact of the war on European organic revenue growth during the quarter was approximately 60 basis points. And as these conditions continue, we anticipate the impact on our full year European growth to be about 120 basis points.\nWe continue to pay our Ukrainian employees regardless of whether they are working. And we are supporting their families who have fled to neighboring countries. As I've always said, our people are our most important assets. And in Ukraine, the well-being of our people is our primary focus today. Varun will provide some additional financial related details to this unfortunate situation shortly.\nNow let's move on to our Specialty segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Specialty segment declined 8.3% in the quarter on a reported basis and 9.8% on a per day basis, largely due to a very tough year-over-year comp. You may recall, this segment reported 33% organic growth in Q1 of last year. So on a 2-year stack, the annual revenue growth is still well into double-digits. We anticipate another tough comparison in Q2 against the 30% growth reported in the second quarter of last year with a positive recovery and a return to year-over-year organic growth in the back half of this year.\nA few other key highlights for Specialty during the quarter. In the first quarter, Specialty hosted our annual Big Show, a customer event, which is focused on SEMA-related parts, and (inaudible) hosted our annual RV Expo for our RV-focused customers. Both events booked solid year-over-year increases in attendance and sales, suggesting good demand in the future. Also, in March, our Specialty team opened a 210,000 square foot distribution center in Orlando, Florida. While it will create a very slight drag on near-term margins while it ramps up, this new distribution facility will help create higher revenue as it will service Florida and Georgia. Both of which are very attractive markets for our RV and marine-related product lines.\nThe supply chain continues to provide challenges. And we're doing our best to get the inventory needed to service customer demand. During the quarter, key port cities in China were shut down for a while. This shifted container capacity to other countries like Taiwan, giving our North American team an opportunity to get some incremental inventory on the water. March was the second best container volume that we've witnessed in 24 months. We expect some of this benefit to continue into April and likely May and this inventory should be at our warehouses by mid to late summer. Once the China lockdowns reopen, we will likely see a regression back to the (inaudible) that we've endured over the past 12 months as the pent-up demand from China comes through. In Europe, product availability remained challenging through Q1 with back orders still running high, but we are witnessing some signs of improvement as we enter Q2.\nTurning to ESG. During the first quarter, we continued our environmental stewardship efforts by processing 193,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of approximately 970,000 gallons of fuel, 562,000 gallons of waste oil, 501,000 tires and 178,000 batteries. During Q1, we also processed approximately 260,000 tons of scrap steel.\nOn the social front, during the quarter, we focused on some key initiatives around the financial and mental health well-being of our employees. As an example, in North America, we implemented a profit-sharing plan, where we made a special contribution of $1,000 to the 401(k) accounts of all eligible team members. Alongside this contribution, we provided services to educate our team on how to think about and plan for retirement. From this initiative alone, we witnessed over 4,000 new 401(K) account openings. We want all employees to benefit from our success. And this plan allows us to reward and thank them for their relentless focus on results, which made a huge impact on our 2021 performance.\nIn Europe, we launched a program called Inspire to Thrive that lets our team know that their mental well-being matters. The goal of this program is multifaceted including creating a supportive culture, addressing factors that may negatively affect mental well-being, addressing negative perceptions of mental well-being issues, providing support to colleagues suffering from mental health issues and developing management skills to address issues when they arise. Operationally, we believe this program will have many benefits, such as higher retention, reductions in sick leave and enhanced productivity. More importantly, however, it's simply the right thing to do for our team and helping them maximize their overall well-being.\nLastly, from a corporate development perspective during the quarter we entered into a transaction to sell our PGW glass business. While a fundamentally solid operation, we had come to the conclusion that LKQ was not the best owner of this business and the margins were always going to be dilutive to the overall North American segment margins. This transaction closed last week and we are extremely pleased with the outcome. As we entered Q2, we are witnessing a healthy pipeline of potential tuck-in acquisitions. And since April 1st, we have closed on 2 small European transactions.\nAnd I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong first quarter financial performance and our increased guidance.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. .\nWhile I'm excited to be able to present another strong set of financial results and I'll cover the details on the quarter shortly. I want to begin with comments on a very eventful start to 2022. As you know, LKQ entered the year with momentum coming off record revenue and profitability in 2021, but also anticipating challenges from the Omicron surge, supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and volatile commodity prices. These factors created headwinds in the quarter and we've had to react quickly to counteract the effects. While there is more work to be done to improve our inventory availability and manage the cost pressures, we are comfortable with the direction we're headed and importantly our position relative to the competition.\nThe Ukraine-Russia conflict has been a further source of volatility, both with its direct impact on our business and the indirect effects on currencies and commodity prices. As Nick mentioned, our revenue at risk owing to the conflict isn't material. But we experienced a negative effect of about $0.01 in Q1 and expect a further $0.05 headwind relative to our original EPS guidance over the balance of the year due to the ongoing conflict.\nPlease note that the impacts associated with lost revenue and other indirect effects of the conflict are not being considered for adjustment in our calculations of segment EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Direct impacts related to asset write-downs and/or reserves are being excluded from the calculations of these metrics. The Q1 exclusion totaled roughly $6 million.\nAs expected, scrap steel and precious metal prices were a drag on results year-over-year. The prices were better than projected in the quarter and thus the negative impact was less severe than anticipated. Compared to Q1 of 2021, metals prices generated a $32 million negative effect on segment EBITDA and a $0.08 impact on adjusted EPS.\nAs discussed on the fourth quarter call, we are now presenting the self-service operating unit as a reportable segment to provide investors with greater visibility into our operating results. I hope that you have had an opportunity to review our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on Monday, the 25th of April, which shows the segment financial information recast under the new presentation.\nAs noted on prior calls, self-service generates a large portion of its revenue from scrap steel and the precious metals and catalytic converters, which makes its results more volatile than the wholesale North America segment. Of the $0.08 negative year-over-year impact from metals, approximately 2/3 is derived from the self-service segment.\nLast week, we completed the sale of our PGW aftermarket glass distribution business for gross proceeds of $362 million. PGW generated almost $400 million of revenue, and its EBITDA margin was approximately 10% in 2021. By divesting PGW, we'll see an improvement in EBITDA margin as the business generated a lower margin than the wholesale North America segment. We intend to use excess cash to repurchase shares in the coming months, though given the timing of the transaction, will be dilutive to full year 2022 EPS by approximately $0.04, which is built into our updated guidance. The full year share count reduction benefit in 2023 will further mitigate the lost PGW earnings. While we expect to report a gain on sale, our U.S. GAAP EPS outlook does not include a gain as the amount has not been finalized. Any gain would be deducted from U.S. GAAP EPS in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS.\nFinally, S&P upgraded LKQ to BBB- with a stable outlook last week. Achieving an investment-grade rating from S&P, in addition to the same from Fitch ratings a year ago is a tremendous accomplishment for the organization and is a testament to our operational excellence program launched in 2019. This program has supported the consistent operating performance, robust cash flows and a resilient business model that S&P cited as reason for the upgrade. The immediate implication of the upgrade is that collateral requirements fall off our senior secured revolving credit facility. And over time, we expect the added flexibility to allow the company to drive even higher levels of free cash flow to invest in growing our business and returning capital to stockholders. Specifically, there will be opportunities to extend vendor payment terms and increase payables. And we expect this benefit to come through over the next few years.\nI'll now shift to the quarterly results. Our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with improving revenue, net income and EPS year-on-year, despite the negative impact of metals, challenges related to inflation and the global supply chain, the Omicron variant, the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine and foreign exchange volatility owing to a stronger U.S. dollar.\nGross margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the first quarter from 2021, with 40 basis points negative effect coming from the self-service margin, which declined owing to metals. Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue rose 80 basis points year-over-year, with higher bad debt expense and inflationary increases in vehicle, freight and fuel expenses. Income taxes in the first quarter of 2022 were booked at 25.1%, consistent with our prior guidance. And finally, as Nick mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.94 for the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was $1 even.\nI'll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 9 Wholesale North America produced an EBITDA margin of 18.1% for the quarter, down 30 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margin was roughly flat as pricing improvements were offset by unfavorable impacts from metals, which had a negative 70 basis point effect in the first quarter. Segment overhead expenses increased by 50 basis points, with the negative effects from inflation on personnel and freight costs. We've previously communicated our expectation for the North America margin to run in the mid to high 16 without the metal effects. With the new segment breakout and the sale of the glass business, we now believe that Wholesale North America EBITDA margin should run approximately 70 basis points higher after normalizing for metals effects.\nEurope reported an 8.8% EBITDA margin for the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year period. As you can see on Slide 10, the margin decrease was attributable to movements in both gross margin and overhead expenses, with negative effects from inflation, higher bad debt expense and effects from the Ukraine-Russia conflict. As mentioned, we anticipate a negative impact on Europe from lost revenue related to the conflict, though the team believes they can deliver a double-digit margin for the full year.\nMoving to Slide 11. Specialty gross margin grew 110 basis points, with benefits from net pricing and mix more than offsetting a 90 basis point negative effect from acquisitions, primarily SeaWide. Overhead expenses increased by 190 basis points, driven by personnel cost inflation and higher vehicle, fuel and freight costs. The overhead expense increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of benefit from operating expense synergies and leverage mostly generated from the SeaWide acquisition. While the specialty EBITDA margin of 12.6% is down relative to the prior year, it's important to acknowledge the progress the business has made over the last 3 years. Pre-pandemic, in Q1 2019, Specialty reported a segment EBITDA margin of 10.7%. The team has done a fine job rationalizing the cost structure and protecting its product margin resulting in a 190 basis point improvement from Q1 of '19 through to Q1 of 2022.\nSelf-service reported an EBITDA margin of 20% for Q1 2022, a strong result for the segment, but below the record margin achieved last year. As you saw in the Form 8-K, with the recast historical segment results, self-services margins can be -- can vary significantly depending on metals prices. Since the beginning of 2019, we've seen a low point for the margin at 6.3% in the third quarter of 2019 and a high point of 27.9% in Q1 of 2021. While there are performance elements that we control, for example, car buying, product pricing and labor efficiency, the self-service business results are driven by trends in scrap steel and precious metals prices. When prices are moving higher, especially when it occurs rapidly with the strong margins in this business and we'll see the downside when prices go the other direction. We believe that breaking up self-service will provide greater clarity to investors. With that background, the decrease in self-services margins in Q1 of 2022 is driven by movements in metals prices and car costs, estimated at an 1,100 basis points negative effect partially offset by improved pricing.\nShifting to liquidity and capital allocation. We sustained the positive momentum we've built in recent years around cash flow generation with free cash flow of approximately $350 million in the first quarter. At a conversion ratio of almost 80% of EBITDA, we are delivering free cash flow above our long-term expectation. For sure, there are some timing elements that will reverse over the course of the year. And we are confident in our ability to generate significant and sustainable free cash flow in line with expectations of converting EBITDA to free cash flow in the 55% to 60% range for the full year.\nWe are cautiously optimistic about the progress we have made with inventory procurement. Access to aftermarket products and cars at auction improved relative to the same period in 2021. And we were able to deploy more cash to build inventory. As shown on Slide 24, we increased our inventory spend and purchased more salvage vehicles than we did in the first quarter of 2021.\nAnd as you can see on Slides 25 and 26, our inventory levels have increased in all 4 segments relative to December, excluding the impacts of the held-for-sale reclassification and foreign currency translation. As of the 31st of March, the Wholesale North America inventory excludes approximately $100 million of glass inventory, which is presented in the held-for-sale asset line on the balance sheet. We remain confident that our inventory position will enable each segment to continue to offer best-in-class availability and service relative to our competitors despite the ongoing supply chain challenges.\nOur capital spending for the quarter of $59 million was in line with our expectation. And following our balanced capital allocation philosophy, we repurchased 2.7 million shares in the quarter for $144 million and issued our quarterly dividend with a $71 million payment in the month of March. We also paid down our debt balance by approximately $53 million in the quarter. Our net leverage ratio came in at 1.3x EBITDA. And interest coverage exceeds 30x compared to the credit facility requirements of 4x and 3x, respectively. In short, we are very comfortable with our credit metrics, which support our investment-grade rating.\nAs our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which will be paid in June to stockholders on record as of the 19th of May.\nAnd finally, I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2022. Our guidance assumes that there are no significant negative developments related to COVID-19 in our major markets. Scrap and precious metal prices hold near the average for the first quarter. And the Ukraine-Russia conflict continues without further escalation.\nOn foreign exchange, rates have been moving rapidly in recent days, with the euro hitting a 5-year low on Wednesday. Our guidance includes weakening European rates in the second quarter, followed by a recovery in the second half of the year. We've dialed in a full year average rate for the euro at $1.09 and the pound sterling at $1.30. Since current rates are below these figures, we have about $0.03 of risk over the balance of the year if rates hold at their current levels.\nHaving said that, with the strong start to the year, we are increasing our organic parts and services revenue growth expectation to between 4.5% and 6.5%. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $4.10, with a midpoint of $3.95. This is an increase of $0.08 compared to the prior midpoint. The raise is primarily attributable to our first quarter performance as the balance of year has mostly offsetting effects as shown on Slide 19 of the earnings deck related to benefits due to organic growth and related operating performance, metals prices above our original forecast and share repurchases, offset by headwinds from lost earnings tied to the Glass disposal in April, weakening FX rates and the impact of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\nPlease note that the share repurchase benefit is attributable both to the shares that we purchased in the first quarter, which will give us a benefit of roughly $0.03 on a full year basis and the anticipated repurchases from the proceeds of the Glass sale of approximately $0.05.\nWhile there are lots of puts and takes in the forecasted numbers, I want to specifically highlight the operating performance component. As I previously stated, our operational excellence initiatives have created a significantly stronger and more resilient business, which is helping us to improve operating results despite the current inflationary environment and supply chain challenges.\nAnd finally, we remain on track to deliver at least $1 billion of free cash flow for the year achieving strong free cash conversion in line with our expectations for the business.\nThank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Varun, for that financial overview.\nWe believe our unique competitive position across all of our operating segments continues to translate into strong results for our company during difficult conditions. I am extremely proud of how our team of 46,000 employees tackle the headwinds we faced over the past 2 years, which subsequently positioned us well as we entered 2022. Our strong first quarter performance and raising our guidance for 2022 is a true validation of our confidence and commitment to creating long-term value for our stockholders.\nAnd again, I would like to acknowledge the bravery and courage of our Ukrainian team as they operate in an unthinkable environment. Our thoughts and hearts are with you all.\nAnd with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

Welcome to the LKQ Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph P. Boutross\n\nVP of IR, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nWe assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days.\nAnd with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and full year 2021, and then Varun will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2022 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks.\nBefore I begin, on behalf of everyone at LKQ, I again want to express our sincere thanks to all those on the front lines who are working hard to keep our communities and our citizens safe and healthy. I also extend condolences to all those who have suffered a personal loss during this unfortunate pandemic. It seems like everyone knows someone who has been seriously impacted by COVID.\nWhile we've made great strides across the globe combating the pandemic, it is still a harsh reality that we all have to confront in our daily lives. As most of you know, LKQ spent 2 decades consolidating fragmented markets into centralized businesses, and in the process, we created the largest and best-in-class operators in each of our major markets.\nThen in 2019, we pivoted our strategy to focus on operational excellence. Some folks may have been skeptical about this pivot, but they may not have had a true understanding of our culture, a culture that is centered on outcomes, not obstacles; a culture that is agile and nimble; and a culture that is LKQ proud.\nIt is with great pride that I can say our teams across all of our segments embraced and delivered on our operational excellence initiatives throughout all of 2021. Before I move on to the fourth quarter results, let me highlight just a few of the milestones we achieved in 2021.\nWe had record corporate-wide revenue and profitability. North America EBITDA and EBITDA margins reached their highest full year level in the history of the company. Europe had full year double-digit EBITDA margins for the first time in over 5 years and reached the upper end of the expectations we set forth a year ago, and there was more runway ahead, especially realized record full year revenue and EBITDA margins.\nWe generated our second year of free cash flow of over $1 billion. We maintained net leverage well below our target of 2x. We achieved an investment-grade rating from Fitch. We purchased 17.2 million shares of stock for a total of $877 million. We issued the first dividend in the history of the company, and we issued our inaugural corporate sustainability report and received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI, which puts LKQ in the top 19% of our index group. These achievements are the result of the combined effort of each individual at LKQ. And for that, I extend a great big thank you to my entire organization.\nNow on to the quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 7.9% as compared to the $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the fourth quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 6.6% on a reported basis and 7.3% on a per day basis. While the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue 1.7% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue 0.8% for total parts and services revenue increase of 7.5%.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $236 million as compared to $180 million for the same period of last year, an increase of 30.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.81 compared to $0.59 for the same period of 2020, an increase of 37.3%.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $254 million compared to $212 million in the same period of last year, a 20% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.87 as compared to $0.69 for the same period of 2020, a 26.1% increase.\nNet income for the full year of 2021 was $1.1 billion as compared to $639 million for 2020, an increase of 70.7%. Diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2021 was $3.66 as compared to $2.09 for 2020, an increase of 75.1%. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year of 2021 was $1.2 billion compared to $777 million last year, a 51.8% increase.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2021 was $3.96 as compared to $2.55 for 2020, a 55.3% increase. These net income numbers represent a tremendous achievement for the company as we achieved net income in excess of $1 billion in 2021 for the first time in our history.\nLet's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 6, organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter for our North American segment increased 8.3% on a reported basis and 9.9% on a per day basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. When comparing to pre-pandemic levels, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment in Q4 of 2021 declined around 5% on a per day basis relative to 2019 levels.\nIndustry data indicates repairable claims declined mid-teens relative to 2019. So it was another quarter of outperformance for our North American operations. Our salvage business and the growth in our major mechanical product groups continued its solid performance during the quarter. Although fill rates for aftermarket collision parts have been challenged, we are again witnessing a positive offset from our quote conversion rates on salvage parts.\nGiven the supply chain disruptions, it's no surprise that our aftermarket parts business lagged the results of our recycling and remanufacturing businesses. In 2021, our North America salvage operations continued its leadership as the largest recycler of vehicles by processing over 783,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 3.9 million gallons of fuel, 2.2 million gallons of waste oil, 2.1 million tires, 740,000 batteries and 1.2 million tons of scrap metal.\nMoving to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services increased 5.7% on a reported basis and 5.4% on a per day basis in the quarter. Demand trends strengthened sequentially in the fourth quarter across all of our European regions. Most of our regional operations experienced similar levels of revenue growth with standout performance from our forest business in the Benelux region and solid contributions from Germany, the U.K. and Central and Eastern Europe.\nOn a full year basis, these businesses performed quite well, both on revenue and profitability. Italy, again, lagged relative to our other markets. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q4, specialty reported organic revenue growth of 5.7% on a reported basis and 7.3% on a per day basis. Considering the tough comparison to an exceptionally strong 2020, this organic growth exceeded our expectations and reflected a tremendous effort by our specialty team.\nA few specialty operational highlights would include the fact that due to the specialty segments, Department of Transportation safety scores and positive inspection history, the team is now eligible to participate in the department's prepass program. This program allows our drivers to bypass weigh stations in certain ports of entry. The benefits of this program will include faster travel time to the docks, less idling time and higher driver retention. Importantly, this program highlights that health and safety of our employees and our other stakeholders is paramount within our organization.\nSecondly, during the quarter, our Specialty segment moved their industry-leading product catalog to a digital format. At the peak, specialty printed over 300,000 copies of these catalogs each consisting of over 1,000 pages, so this represents a savings of 300 million printed pages. This green focus and shift to a digital catalog is another example of how our teams across all segments are driving our environmental leadership into all facets of the business.\nLooking ahead, we expect solid revenue growth across all 3 of our segments in 2022 as we creep back to pre-pandemic volumes, get some relief from the aftermarket supply chain in the back half of the year and utilize strategic pricing initiatives. Specifically, we are still running behind 2019 revenue in North America but we are closing the gap and expect to approach pre-pandemic revenue levels as we exit 2022.\nEurope is back to pre-pandemic revenue levels, and we look forward to continuing the positive momentum from Q4 as we move forward in 2022. And Specialty is obviously already running well ahead of pre-pandemic revenue levels. On the corporate development front, as mentioned in our last call, in the first week of October, we completed the acquisition of Hamu, one of the leading independent car parts wholesalers in the Netherlands; and SeaWide Marine Distribution, a nationwide electronics wholesale distributor that supplies electrical and electronic products for the marine, outdoor and personal navigation markets.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continued the build-out of our ESG program by implementing various social initiatives. In December, the company launched our LKQ Cares Holiday Vote, a unique program in which all employees had a voice in determining how LKQ's donations are allocated.\nWith this program, LKQ donated funds to 10 separate nonprofit organizations across the globe during the holiday period. Also in December, the LKQ Community Foundation donated monies to assess various nonprofits with relief and recovery efforts from the long track tornado that produce severe catastrophic damage in several states in numerous communities.\nLet's now turn to the inflationary environment, a key item of interest for most listeners on this call. Inflation was a harsh reality across each of our segments, especially during the fourth quarter when inflation climbed to a 39-year high in December. The rise in prices is fairly straightforward, a combination of unprecedented supply chain and labor disruptions, which choke output in monetary and fiscal stimulus, which accelerated demand.\nGlobal disruptions of this size and philosophy do not reset overnight, and we suspect it will continue to be a headwind throughout 2022, but make no mistake, we are not resting and waiting for this to reset. Our segment teams have implemented processes with our supplier and customer partners to deal with price changes in a more planned and structured way, ultimately staying ahead of the inflationary trends.\nOf course, the success of these ongoing processes will depend on the timing of the recovery in the supply chain, including some relief in ocean freight cost. Related to labor, by the end of December 2021, there were 11 million job openings in the United States. Simply stated, there is a battle to hire and retain talent at all levels of the organization, and prospective hires clearly have leverage, and that comes at a cost.\nOur North American operations have over 1,000 open positions, which represents roughly a 6% vacancy rate. In 2021, we witnessed 5% to 7% net increase in wages for our business in North America. We are working diligently to develop creative ways to recruit potential candidates beyond just compensation. To expand the recruiting efforts, we are building partnerships that focus on the skills needed for the open positions and exploring how we can attract talent.\nIn 2021, we invested in the benefit plans provided to our employees, including, but not limited to, enhancements to our core behavioral health and paid parental leave programs. Our European operations are facing the same challenges and are currently running at a 3.5% vacancy rate with wages increasing between 3% and 5% in 2021.\nFocusing on retention and recruiting as well at the end of the fourth quarter, our Europe team launched a comprehensive employee engagement survey with WorkBuzz to further understand the employee experience and how we can be their employer of choice. The team invested in development for their leadership team and mental well-being training for all colleagues across Europe.\nThe labor impact is an industry-wide issue. In the fourth quarter, the national average scheduling backlog for collision repair shops was 3.4 weeks versus pre-pandemic levels of just 1.7 weeks. The doubling of the backlog is predominantly due to technician shortages and to a lesser extent, parts availability. Based on the milestones we achieved throughout 2021, clearly, our teams have been judicious with quickly driving change, and I am confident we will operate with the same level of vigor to combat the headwinds we face with the supply chain and labor and freight costs, all against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic.\nLastly, before I turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2022, I am pleased to announce that on February 15, 2022, our Board of Directors approved our second quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 a share payable on March 24, 2022, to all stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2022.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Varun.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I go into details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to spend a moment to reflect on the last 2 years operating in the pandemic. Since the world was turned upside down in March of 2020, we leveraged LKQ's core strengths, namely our best-in-class inventory availability and service reliability, extensive distribution network, a rock-solid balance sheet and most importantly, our people to be successful in adverse conditions.\nWe accelerated our operational excellence program to make the business more resilient and have delivered record annual results yet again while creating a strong position for the company to participate in the demand recovery. The performance of the past 3 years since the pivot to operational excellence and in 2021, in particular, highlights the benefits of our operating initiatives.\nBy many measures, 2021 was an outstanding year. In terms of profitability, we generated record full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.96, an increase of 55% compared to 2020, our previous high watermark. During the September 2020 Investor Day, I set the expectation that LKQ aimed to be a double-digit EPS compounder with about half coming from organic growth and productivity and the rest from judicious capital allocation.\nWith our 2021 results, we surpassed this expectation and picked up about 3 years of EPS growth in a single year. We have sustained the momentum built in recent years around cash flow generation with free cash flow of $1.1 billion in 2021 and successfully reset the business model to operate at this higher level going forward.\nAt a conversion ratio of 60% of EBITDA, we are delivering free cash flow in line with our long-term expectation. Generating significant and sustainable free cash flow has accelerated various capital allocation options, including our share repurchase program maintaining investment-grade credit metrics and initiating a regular quarterly dividend.\nWith a focus on operational excellence, including integrating our acquisitions and converting profit to cash, we have made significant progress in improving our return on invested capital. By our internal measure of ROIC, which essentially ignores the amortization of intangibles, we exceeded 15% in 2021 after running at approximately 10% just a few years ago. All of this reflects our commitment to delivering long-term value to our various stakeholders.\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to the entire LKQ team for their dedication and hard work. It takes all 45,000 of us rowing in the same direction to deliver such outcomes. We have raised the bar on what LKQ can be, and we have more to come.\nNow shifting to the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter results reflect a solid finish to the year with improving revenue, net income and earnings per share year-over-year despite, as expected, the negative impact of metals, challenges to inflation, the global supply chain and the Omicron variant.\nGross margin remained a year-over-year benefit with improvement in Europe, offsetting metals driven softness in North America margins. Unlike the first 3 quarters of 2021, commodity prices had a negative effect on margins in the fourth quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices produce year-over-year decreases of approximately $16 million in segment EBITDA and $0.04 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter.\nIn 2020, we benefited from significant sequential increases in scrap steel and precious metal prices during the fourth quarter, while 2021 showed roughly flat to declining sequential changes. Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 130 basis points year-over-year with over half driven by personnel costs. The tight labor market has pushed wages higher in many of our markets. Additionally, strong performance across all 3 segments contributed to increased levels of incentive compensation in 2021, which, of course, resets with new targets for 2022.\nI'll now turn to segment operating results. Starting on Slide #10, North America produced an EBITDA margin of 15.1% for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was unfavorable by 50 basis points, primarily related to the metals effect, which had a negative 210 basis point effect on gross margin in the fourth quarter. The benefits from ongoing margin initiatives in the wholesale business and improved pricing partially offset the metals impact.\nSegment overhead expenses increased by 230 basis points, with the largest change going to personnel expenses. Roughly half of the 140 basis point increase in personnel expenses is attributable to higher incentive compensation with the remainder related to wages, temporary labor and medical costs.\nHigher freight and fuel costs drove a further 80 basis point increase in overhead expenses. With some of the overhead leverage benefit from higher revenue dollars, offsetting a portion of the gross margin impact, metals had a negative 170 basis points effect on the reported 15.1% segment EBITDA margin. This result is consistent with our expectations for a mid- to high 16% baseline without the metals impact.\nFor the full year, the reported North America segment EBITDA margin of 18.3% benefited by roughly 100 basis points from metals prices mostly in the first half of the year.\nMoving to Europe. Europe continued its strong performance with an 8.9% EBITDA margin, the highest fourth quarter figure since 2015 and finished the full year with 10.2%. As you can see on Slide 11, gross margin was the primary driver of the fourth quarter improvement with better net pricing.\nWe are pleased with Europe's progress in delivering a double-digit full year segment EBITDA margin, and we are confident that there's further opportunity ahead.\nMoving to Slide 12. Specialty held gross margin roughly flat despite inflationary pressures in the segment's 1 operations and a negative mix effect from the SeaWide acquisition with offsetting benefits in net pricing. Operating expenses increased by 80 basis points, driven mostly by personnel expenses, higher wages, medical costs and incentive compensation, which, of course, some of it will be reset to reflect 2022 targets.\nThe Specialty team made great progress on the SeaWide integration plan during the fourth quarter by moving all inventory into existing facilities in December and subsequently has exited 3 of the 4 acquired facilities in January, which, of course, will create cost savings going forward.\nIncome taxes in the fourth quarter of 2021 included discrete benefits of $0.07, primarily related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances and true-ups related to prior year tax return filings. There was a benefit of $0.025, reflecting the change in estimate of our effective tax rate as we closed out our 2021 financials.\nWhile the discrete benefits in the 2021 rate are nonrecurring, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate going forward and have included 25.1% in our 2022 guidance assumptions.\nShifting to liquidity and capital allocation. We have been foreshadowing a cash outflow for inventory whole year, as we've looked to rebuild our inventory levels in anticipation of demand recovery. The outflow has been delayed by supply chain issues, but we began to see some real progress in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 31, we were able to grow our inventory balances in all 3 segments in the fourth quarter, an opportunity which drove a higher-than-expected cash outflow of $182 million.\nWhile there are still some challenges getting aftermarket products to our locations, given the challenges with ocean freight and ongoing congestion at the ports here in North America, we saw robust activity at the auctions and grew our salvage inventory to support the strong growth in this category. We were also successful in increasing the inventory for our Specialty segment ahead of the key selling season with a number of shows that take place in the first quarter. We are confident that our inventory positions will enable each segment to continue to offer best-in-class availability and service relative to our competitors despite the ongoing supply chain challenges.\nOur capital spending for the quarter was higher than what we've seen in recent years. With a backdrop of inflation continuing for the foreseeable future, the increase was driven by strategic capital deployment during the quarter as we identified a series of opportunities mostly related to our salvage business in North America to invest in real estate.\nThese investments, which include site expansions and the purchase of a new facility for our Denver operation will provide room for growth in our salvage business. Additionally, we identified other high-return investments related to vehicles, equipment and systems to undertake in the fourth quarter, given the long lead times with the ongoing supply chain disruptions.\nIn total, the real estate and other strategic purchases totaled about $90 million for the quarter, which accounts for much of the growth in capital spending. Full year free cash flow, as I mentioned previously, was $1.1 billion, our second year in a row being above the $1 billion mark. At a 60% conversion ratio for free cash flow to EBITDA for the year, this was roughly $275 million above our original guidance flow of $800 million when we gave guidance for 2021 last February.\nFollowing our balanced capital allocation philosophy, we repurchased 5.3 million shares in the quarter for $297 million and issued our first quarterly dividend with a $73 million payment in December. We also acquired businesses in the fourth quarter, SeaWide in our Specialty segment and a tuck-in business in the Benelux market for a total consideration of $57 million.\nOur net leverage ratio came in at 1.4x EBITDA and interest coverage now exceeds 28x compared to the credit facility requirements of 4x and 3x, respectively. We are well positioned with our credit metrics, which are consistent with an investment-grade profile, and we remain committed to achieving an investment-grade rating. As our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board has approved the quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which will be paid to stockholders on record as of March 3.\nI will wrap up my prepared comments with thoughts on our 2022. Over the past 2 years of living with the once-in-100-year health crisis, what has become clear is the resiliency of our end markets and our team's ability to deliver solid results utilizing the operational excellence toolkit. This, in effect, gives us the confidence to reinstate full year guidance, including organic revenue growth for the coming year.\nOur guidance assumes that, one, there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets; two, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels for the remainder of the year. Three, scrap and precious metal prices trend lower than what we've currently seen in the month of February and an effective tax rate of 25.1%. So with that, we expect organic parts and services revenue growth of between 3% and 5% with higher growth rates in the second half of the year than the first half.\nWith ongoing inflationary pressures exacerbated by the supply chain challenges, we remain confident in our ability to positively work through pricing changes as needed. Second, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.72 to $4.02 with a midpoint of $3.87. This is a decrease of $0.09 or 2% at the midpoint relative to the 2021 actual figure.\nLooking at Slide #19, you can see how we get from the 2021 actual EPS to our 2022 expectation. We've been transparent about the commodities benefit on our 2021 results. And with lower prices anticipated for 2022, we will face a headwind of roughly $0.27 related to scrap steel and precious metal prices, predominantly in the self-service operating unit.\nThe favorable discrete tax adjustments in 2021 will not reoccur, which will lower EPS by a further $0.06. Additionally, lower average foreign exchange rates will have a $0.04 negative effect year-over-year, and we had a $0.03 pickup of fair value adjustments related to certain equity investments that we're not projecting to reoccur in 2022. Taking these factors into account, we're looking at a baseline EPS figure of $3.56. On a 2-year stack, we remain well above our long-term growth expectations in 2022, and we expect annual growth rates to normalize in 2023.\nThe operational excellence initiatives have created a significantly stronger and more resilient business, which we believe will support our ability to improve operating results despite the current inflationary environment and supply chain challenges.\nAnd finally, our balance sheet is solid. We continue to generate outstanding free cash flow through strong profitability and judicious use of trade working capital. We are projecting to generate free cash flow of at least $1 billion in 2022 as we sustain a healthy conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow.\nBefore I turn it back to Nick, I want to inform everyone that we are contemplating breaking out the Self Service operating unit as a separate reportable segment in 2022. While we are not planning any changes in how Self Service is operated or how it interacts with the wholesale business, we would like to provide investors even greater transparency into the North America business, especially as it relates to the metals impact. We will provide further information on the decision ahead of our first quarter earnings call in late April.\nThanks for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.\n\nDominick P. Zarcone\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, LKQ Corporation\n\nThank you, Varun. In closing, 2021 was a banner year for LKQ, and I could not be prouder of the collective efforts of my global teams. Let me restate our key strategic pillars which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered 2022.\nFirst, we will continue to allocate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And last but not least, we will continue to invest in our future. With these pillars in place, coupled with our industry-leading teams, we are well positioned to face the challenges in the first half of the year, and we'll continue to deliver positive year-over-year operating results for our shareholders.\nAs always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each and every day. They are truly our greatest asset. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

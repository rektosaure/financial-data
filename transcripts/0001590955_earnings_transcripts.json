My name is Lauren, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Paycom's Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to James Samford Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nJames Samford\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome to Paycom earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2025. Certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives and expected performance, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Chad Richardson, Paycom's CEO and President.\nChad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll briefly comment on third quarter results and recent product innovations. I'll then turn it over to Bob for a review of our third quarter results and our full year guidance. We will then take questions. Let's get started.\nThird quarter results came in strong with double-digit organic recurring revenue growth and continued margin expansion, setting us up to exceed our full year financial plan for 2025. In addition to strong financials, we also executed the launch of our award-winning and industry-first command-driven AI product, [indiscernible]. Now enabled across our entire client base, in is transforming how our clients and their employees engage with their HR and payroll data. ION has already successfully responded to means of queries from employees, managers and executives extending the power of our full solution automation.\nWe are seeing a dramatic uptick in usage, especially among new users which include the C-suite and newly onboarded employees of our clients. The intuitive nature of [indiscernible] means new employees no longer need training on the system and are able to utilize the full solution upon hire. I'm particularly encouraged by the engagement we are seeing among the C-suite. Traditionally, executives have not been daily users of HCM solutions. With [indiscernible] thousands of C-suite executives are already pulling data and insights directly from the Paycom system, and the feedback has been phenomenal.\nI'm confident that command-driven functionality is the future for all software. Betty is another example of automation that delivers significant ROI and is driving new sales. This award-winning payroll solution reduces payroll processing labor by up to 90% while also cutting the time spent correcting payroll errors by up to 85%. [indiscernible] not only protects employees against insufficient funds by ensuring that payroll is correct prior to payday. It also eliminates human interaction with nonrevenue-generating tasks associated with avoided payments, check reversals, ledger updates and post payroll adjustments just to name a few.\nBetty also enhances payroll compliance, ensuring accurate tax withholding along with wage and our accuracy, which reduces employer liability because employees have control over the accuracy of their check. Additionally, automation and perfect payroll with [indiscernible] is also attracting former clients back to Paycom. Recently, 2 clients who are not previous Betty users came back to Paycom thanks to Betty. One of these was a large auto group who after leaving Paycom had numerous issues processing multiple payrolls across their more than 25 locations that impacted their employees.\nThey quickly realized the mistake they made and reached out to us to come back. Upon the return, they were quick to adopt Betty because of the payroll automation and paycheck transparency. The second example of an organization returning was a manufacturing company, whose employees quickly voice frustration over the switch away from Paycom, especially managers who lost access to the information they were accustomed to resulting in a slowdown in revenue-generating work. This organization pointed to Betty as a significant reason for the return in a game changer with 100% accurate payrolls thanks to Betty identifying and notifying employees of items that need attention prior to payday.\n[indiscernible] continues to be a powerful differentiator for us in the market as we continue to drive even more automation and deliver very strong ROI to our clients. To facilitate the automation experience, including [ IWAN ] and future AI developments in the pipeline, we significantly expanded our data center capabilities, spending roughly $100 million of AI-focused CapEx on our Phoenix and Oklahoma City data centers. We front-loaded this CapEx to match the timing of our [indiscernible] rollout in Q3.\nOwning and operating advanced data centers is a sustainable competitive advantage for Paycom, particularly for clients who have reservations about opening up their critical data to external LOMs. [indiscernible] hosted by Paycom only draws from Paycom's single database, which eliminates conflicts created by inconsistent or duplicative external data sets, significantly improving data integrity and the quality of the user experience. Thanks to our product innovation and our focus on world-class service, client satisfaction trends remain strong.\nWe provide high-touch personal service and our clients appreciate our service levels now more than ever. We complement our high-touch service model with full solution automation, which drives service operation efficiency. As a result, we've seen a 20% to 30% year-over-year decline in internal tickets and inbound client call volume. These are positive influencers on client satisfaction. With our strong third quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of 2025, we are set to deliver a milestone year with over $2 billion in total revenues, all through organic growth and near-record level adjusted EBITDA margins.\nPaycom has been leading our industry in innovation and client ROI achievement since we were founded. Now with automated products like [indiscernible], we are well positioned for continued strong performance in the future. I want to thank all of our employees for their consistent contribution to Paycom's success and also thank our clients for trusting us to deliver unmatched value through full solution automation.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert D. Foster\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Chad. Before I review our third quarter 2025 results and updated outlook for 2025. I'd like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered strong third quarter results with total revenues of $493 million, up 9.1% over the comparable prior year period. and recurring and other revenues of $467 million, up 10.6% year-over-year. Interest on funds held for clients declined 11% year-over-year to $27 million in the third quarter of 2025. GAAP net income in the quarter was $111 million or $1.96 per diluted share based on 56 million shares. Included in GAAP net income is a tax-adjusted onetime gain of approximately $26 million or $0.47 per diluted share related to the modification of our naming rights agreement.\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter increased 17% year-over-year to $110 million or $1.94 per diluted share. Profitability continues to increase as we realize operational efficiencies and deliver consistent margin expansion. Even with the 11% decline in interest on funds held by clients in the third quarter, our robust business model produced a 13% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA. And to $194 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 39%, representing a 150 basis point increase over the prior year period. Margin strength in the quarter was driven by automation and operating efficiencies in service, support and in G&A.\nAs we indicated in our last earnings call, we ramped up marketing spend in the third quarter to support our product and brand strategies, including marketing related to our recent launch of iWatt. Feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to seeing the benefits from our marketing initiatives in the quarters to come. We continue to invest in the areas of sales, personal service, new client operations and our product. With our solid Q3 results, we are on track to deliver on our full year plan for double-digit organic recurring and other revenue growth and expanding adjusted EBITDA margins.\nOur single database in our owned and operated data centers our competitive differentiators that enable us to rapidly develop and deploy new automations to benefit all our clients. During the quarter, we launched our most advanced automation solution ever [indiscernible] which is now enabled to our entire client base. To support Ian, we front-loaded a significant CapEx investment in advanced AI hardware and equipment within our data centers. More specifically, we invested approximately $100 million into our data centers, and that spend is now largely complete.\nThis investment provides us a multiyear capacity runway to support our AI initiatives. Over the last 2 months, we repurchased $319 million of common stock in the open market. buying back over 1.5 million shares or almost 3% of shares outstanding as of the end of August 2025. Since the beginning of 2023, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend program. During that period, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of common stock for $806 million or approximately 7% of our 2022 year-end shares outstanding.\nWe paid approximately $213 million in dividends. We still have approximately $1.1 billion remaining under our buyback authorization as of October 31, 2025, and the revolving credit facility of $1 billion available for us to execute on. Earlier this week, the Board approved our quarterly dividend [indiscernible] per share payable in mid-December. Even with these significant uses of cash in the quarter, our balance sheet remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $375 million and no debt. The average daily balance on funds out for clients was approximately $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, up 9% over the prior year period.\nNow let me turn to guidance for 2025. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we are well positioned to meet our full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges. We continue to expect total revenue to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion, up 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. Within revenues, we expect organic full year recurring and other revenue to be up 10% year-over-year and interest on funds offer clients to be down 10% year-over-year to $113 million, assuming 1 additional rate cut later this year.\nOur full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $872 million to $882 million, representing year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 160 basis points to near record levels at approximately 43% at the midpoint of the range. Other forward-looking items include full year GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 27% and 26%, respectively, and stock compensation of approximately 7% of revenues. We delivered strong results in the third quarter and reinvested our capital into data centers while at the same time, returning significant cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n2025 has been a strong year, and we are well positioned for a robust 2026 and beyond. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

I'll focus my comments on our second quarter achievements and highlight our latest AI command-driven product, IWant. I'll then turn it over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results and an update on our full year guidance. We will then take questions.\nWith that, let's get started. We delivered very strong second quarter results, and we are building on our momentum by continuing to strengthen recurring revenue growth and margin expansion in 2025. Outside sales continues to set records, and we recently released IWant, the most significant product in our company's history. We already have the most automated solution in the industry, and I want delivers even more value to our clients through AI and automation.\nI want will transform a client's relationship with Paycom and with its own business. Hopefully, everyone has seen the in demo we linked in today's earnings press release issued at the close of the market. If you did, you saw numerous use cases for in on the employee, manager, administrator and executive side of the software. You also saw how I want eliminates the need for a Paycom user to be trained on our software.\nWith IWant's command-driven AI users either type in or leverage voice-activated functionality to command the system, and IWant is designed to immediately provide the answer with accurate results. This means that navigation and asking others for system information is rendered obsolete. A critical component of AI is the data it pulls from. And because IWant pulls from Paycom's single database, it eliminates problems created by inconsistent or duplicative data sets.\nOn the manager side, IWant supports HR teams and organization leaders with instant employee information. For example, a manager can use IWant to pull data on when an employee returns from vacation, see who's clocked in for the day or analyze an employee's pay history. These are just a few examples of the power of IWant. Before IWant, executives like myself were dependent upon others to complete reports and provide critical decision-making information.\nToday, and IWant's executive mode executives using Paycom now have the information they need at their fingertips, enabling them to be daily users of our solution without ever having to be trained on the system. Just tell it what you want and IWant delivers, making executives even smarter and more effective.\nNow I can quickly find any information about my staff available in our single database because we track the entire employee life cycle and have data from applicant tracking, onboarding, Paycom Learning, expenses, benefits, time and attendance, payroll, schedules, surveys and more, all accessible through IWant. Early feedback has been phenomenal with clients calling this a total game changer. IWant's command-driven AI engine will increase usage among non-daily users in our system. And I fully expect IWant to increase satisfaction and client ROI.\nVoice-activated command-driven functionality is the future for all software and Paycom's future started last week. We invest in innovation to increase client value, and this is skilling strong sales for Paycom. Our sales teams continue to set new records every quarter, and I'm very pleased with their strong execution. Our sales force was recently recognized by Selling Power magazine as one of the best sales organizations in the country. This is a testament to our sales leadership, training and culture.\nFinally, Time Magazine listed Paycom amongst its best companies for a second consecutive year. Newsweek placed Paycom in the top 20 of their inaugural ranking of America's best online platforms and comparably recognized Paycom for best career growth and best leadership teams. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment that are reflected in these awards.\nWe had very strong results in the first half and we are set up for continued strong momentum for the rest of 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert D. Foster\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Chad. Before I review our second quarter 2025 results and our commentary for the remainder of 2025, I'd like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered very strong second quarter results. Total revenue of $484 million increased 11% over the comparable prior year period with even faster growth in recurring and other revenue of 12% year-over-year, reaching $455 million.\nInterest on funds held for clients declined 11% year-over-year as expected to approximately $28 million in the second quarter of 2025. GAAP net income in the quarter was $89 million or $1.58 per diluted share based on 56.5 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $117 million or $2.06 in per diluted share. Profitability in the second quarter also increased significantly with adjusted EBITDA of $198 million, reflecting a 24% increase over the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, representing a 450 basis point increase over the prior year period. Margin strength in the quarter was driven by revenue upside efficiency gains in G&A and timing of marketing spend. We continue to invest in the areas of AI, product and R&D. And as Chad mentioned last week, we introduced our most innovative development to date, IWant. Based on the strength of the first half of 2025, I am pleased to report that Paycom is in a very strong financial position, and we are raising our revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets for the year.\nOur balance sheet is also very strong. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $532 million and no debt. The average daily balance on funds held for clients was approximately $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2025, up 10% over the prior year period. During the second quarter of 2025, we paid approximately $22 million in cash dividends. Earlier this week, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-September. We also purchased roughly $33 million of common stock through net downs on vested stock during the second quarter of 2025. And we still have $1.44 billion remaining under our stock repurchase plan.\nNow let me turn to guidance for 2025. We continue to have success selling and onboarding new logos. Based on our strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges. We now expect total revenue to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion, up 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. For the full year 2025, we expect recurring and other revenue to be up 10% year-over-year, including quarterly growth of approximately 10.5% and and 11% year-over-year in Q3 and Q4, respectively.\nOur revenue expectation for interest on funds held for clients is now $113 million in 2025, down 10% year-over-year, assuming 2 rate cuts later this year. Revenue upside along with continued automation of HCM and payroll manual tasks is driving margin improvement for Paycom. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range to between $872 million and $882 million. This represents a second increase to our prior adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to approximately 43% at the midpoint of the range.\nWe plan to increase our marketing and R&D budgets in the back half of the year in support of the Iowa product launch and additional innovation focused on AI and automation. Other forward-looking items include full year GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 27% and 26%, respectively, and stock compensation of approximately 7% of revenues. We are pleased to see employees across the organization executing very well, which is driving our solid performance year-to-date. Our go-to market and product strategies are working, and we are well positioned to deliver on our raised expectations for the year.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2024 with strong momentum, thanks to focused execution, organic sales growth and operational efficiency gains. Before diving in, I want to welcome our next CFO, Bob Foster. Bob joined Paycom over 2 years ago after working within the industry as the CEO and Chairman of a payroll company for 8 years. Prior to that, he served as a senior partner at Ernst & Young, managing several of the firm's largest accounts. He brings industry experience, process expertise and a strong financial pedigree to lead our financial team. He will assume the role of CFO effective February 21, when my longtime brand and colleague, Craig Boelte, officially retires.\nAfter my opening remarks, Craig will review our fourth quarter and full year results and Bob will provide comments on our full year guidance. We will then take your questions.\nWith that, let's get started. Our performance strengthened throughout the year as we diligently executed our 2024 plan. We expect to fuel our momentum in 2025 by maintaining our focus on full solution automation, client ROI achievement and delivering world-class service. 20 years ago when we sold our software, user buyers bought the product because they wanted to do more with this software. And today, they want the software to do more for them. We already have the most automated solution in the industry, and we are rapidly moving towards full solution automation, driving even more ROI for our clients. Simply put, our software vision is that people shouldn't do tasks that systems can safely automate.\nOn the payroll side, Beti continues to eliminate non-revenue-generating tasks, which allow clients to shift resources to more profitable activities. Beti is a highly differentiated automated solution that delivers strong client ROI. Having employees do their own payroll as the most effective way to do payroll, and we are seeing this validated daily. Take, for example, a client of ours in the professional sports industry. Prior to Beti, this 500-employee organization worked through payroll issues for days leading up to their submission deadline.\nThey ran separate reports and supervisors chased down employees to fix time and attendance issues. With Beti, their employees ensure their check is correct, which has significantly increased employee trust and the client has automated 85% of the time and effort previously wasted on payroll. We onboarded a 2,000-employee retail client that operates in multiple states. This client raved about their seamless transition process, and they confirm they have also reduced their payroll processing time by nearly 85%. In addition to the payroll savings, their HR team saved an additional month annually of unproductive time to automations outside of the payroll process. Clients continue to see strong ROI from our automated time and labor management solutions.\nFor many clients, unproductive time represents roughly 10% of labor costs. With GONE, clients can eliminate unnecessary interaction points by providing a consistent and fully automated experience for employees, managers, HR administrators and the business as a whole. A recent Forrester study found that GONE can generate an ROI of up to 800%. Through the automation of time-off decisions, managers saved nearly a week of unproductive hours annually. And on average, companies save nearly 5 weeks of unproductive time in the areas of HR, finance and accounting every year. We were pleased that GONE received the Business Intelligence Group's Innovation Award, which is awarded to the organization's changing how employees experience the world.\nInternally, we are experiencing increased efficiencies through product automation. Paycom's AI agent, which was rolled out to our service team 6 months ago, utilizes our own knowledge-based semantic search model to provide faster responses and help our clients more quickly and consistently than ever before. As responses continuously improve over time, our client interactions become more valuable, and we connect them faster to the right solution. As a result, we are seeing improved immediate response rates and have eliminated service tickets by over 25% compared to a year ago.\nWe remain committed to having a high-touch service model, which means we'll always have a single point of contact for our clients to provide them personal service. But with automations like AI agent, we are realizing internal efficiencies, driving increasing client satisfaction and seeing higher Net Promoter Scores. Through our internal automation efforts, we are identifying opportunities to automate even more processes that currently require a necessarily human interaction, and this is having a positive impact on our service initiatives and margins.\nThanks to these efforts, we ended the year with roughly the same headcount as last year. while continuing to attract talent in the key areas of service, sales and R&D. Demand for the most automated solution in our industry provided by Paycom is stronger than ever, and sales is having record success as more businesses experienced the benefits of solution automation. With greater success amongst our sales organization, we have more individuals ready to be leaders. And with a deep bench of sales leaders, we opened 3 new sales offices in January.\nThese are located in Raleigh, North Carolina, Los Angeles, California and Providence, Rhode Island, which brings our total outside sales teams to 57. Our culture was highlighted by comparably in Q4 as Paycom was the top company for compensation and best company culture. Additionally, Newsweek recognized us as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity. With the most automated product, consistent retention and kicking off the year with record sales growth, we are set up to perform well in 2025 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2024, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Also, in our income statement, we have broken out total revenue into recurring and other revenue and interest on funds held for clients. In our earnings press release today, we provided 2024 quarterly revenue amounts to conform to this presentation. This change has no impact on total revenue or any other line item in our income statement. We ended the year with solid results with full year 2024 revenue of $1.88 billion, representing 11% organic growth compared to 2023. Full year recurring and other revenue was $1.76 billion, also up 11% compared to 2023. And interest on funds held for clients of $125 million was up approximately 16% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter results were better than expected with total revenue of $494 million, representing growth of approximately 14% over the comparable prior year period. Recurring and other revenue in the fourth quarter was $465 million, up 14.5% compared to 2023. We generated $29 million of interest on funds held for clients, up approximately 2% year-over-year on an average daily balance of approximately $2.5 billion. Our strong top line results and recent operating efficiency gains translated into even stronger bottom line results. Full year GAAP net income was $502 million or $8.92 per diluted share based on approximately 56 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for 2024 was $462 million or $8.21 per diluted share.\nIn the fourth quarter, GAAP net income of $114 million and non-GAAP net income of $130 million represented $2.02 and $2.32 per diluted share, respectively, based on approximately 56 million shares. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $775 million, representing full year margin of 41.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $215 million representing a quarterly margin of 43.5%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. We continue to invest in automation across our software. Adjusted R&D expense was $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 or 12% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $73 million in the prior year period.\nOur tax rate for 2024 was 23% on a GAAP basis. For the full year 2025, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 29% on a GAAP basis and approximately 27% on a non-GAAP basis. In fiscal year 2025, we expect stock-based compensation expense as a percent of revenue to be approximately 8%. Cash flow from operations in 2024 was $534 million, representing 28% margin. Total CapEx of $197 million in 2024 represented approximately 10% of total revenues compared to approximately 12% of total revenues in 2023. We estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be below 10% in 2025. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx and was $337 million in 2024, up 17% year-over-year. Free cash flow margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to approximately 18%. In 2024, we repurchased over 900,000 shares of common stock or approximately 2% of our shares outstanding for a total of $145 million, and we paid over $84 million in cash dividends.\nSince the beginning of 2023, we repurchased over 2.4 million shares or approximately 4% of shares outstanding for approximately $445 million. We still have approximately $1.48 billion remaining under our buyback authorization as of December 31, 2024, and the Board has approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-March.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Even after returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends paid in 2024, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $402 million and 0 debt. We ended 2024 with approximately 37,500 clients, representing a growth rate of 2% compared to 2023. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with approximately 19,400 clients. And of those, clients with greater than 1,000 employees were up 12% year-over-year. Total employee records stored in our system in 2024 was 7 million, up 3% year-over-year. Paycom's annual revenue retention rate in 2024 was 90%, which was consistent with 2023. 2024 was a solid year of execution with strengthening fundamentals as the year progressed.\nI want to thank our employees for all the hard work that is paying off. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for guidance. Bob?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Craig, and thank you, Chad, for the opportunity to take the financial reins of such an innovative and profitable company. For the near term, the plan is to continue to fuel the momentum we have been building in 2024 in the areas of R&D, sales and investing in automation to benefit our clients as well as us internally.\nOur approach to guidance remains consistent as we guide to what we can see today, and factor in relevant trends, opportunities and potential constraints. With the goal of aligning our guidance with our long-term focus and consistent with how we run our business, we are transitioning to an annual revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance framework. For fiscal 2025, we expect total revenue to be between [ $2.15 billion to $2.35 billion ] or approximately 8% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We expect full year recurring and other revenue to be up approximately 9% year-over-year. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $820 million to $840 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% at the midpoint of the range.\nThis represents one of our highest initial margin guide. Included in total revenue outlook is Inchon Funds held for clients of approximately $110 million, down 12% year-over-year. Looking at the shape of the year, we expect first quarter growth to be the low point of the year. We expect recurring and other revenue growth to accelerate to consistent double digits every quarter thereafter, as we benefit from record sales and consistent retention trends. We have positive momentum and are positioned well in 2025. We have an organic growth model that produces high-quality revenue and profit. We also have the talent and the product vision to build on our success.\nBefore taking your questions, I want to thank Craig for what he has meant to Paycom, our clients and our employees over the last 20 years. From all of us, Craig, thank you. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator?"

My name is Cameron and I will be your moderator for today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. You may proceed.\n\nJames Samford\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2024.\nCertain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call.\nWhile we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on the current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. You should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information.\nAny forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nAlso during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and certain adjusted expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's CEO and President. Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll focus my comments on the progress we are making on our 2024 initiatives, and then I'll turn it over to Craig, who will review our financials and guidance before taking questions.\nThis year, we remain focused on providing world-class service to our clients, solidifying client ROI achievement and deepening our automation capabilities through product innovation. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making on these client-focused initiatives as they are resonating across our client base. As a result of our initiatives, our client usage metrics and our Net Promoter Score are up and trending positively.\nBeyond that, I'm very pleased with our achievements on the product front. We continue to lead the industry in automation. Our clients consistently confirm this view. We continue to eclipse our functionality with even greater automation as we rapidly move towards full solution automation. The enhancements we made to our development processes at the end of 2023 enabled us to transform our solutions even faster. Year-to-date, we have more than doubled our development productivity rates and implemented functionality for our clients that eliminates redundant payroll and HR work through automation and employee usage.\nWe are rapidly eclipsing the industry by delivering a fundamentally differentiated value proposition for our clients, which ultimately results in a better employee experience. We are focused on continuing to automate the most automated solution in the industry. 2 examples of automation in our industry are Beti and GONE. Every month, millions of checks are processed directly by employees using Beti, delivering our clients' measurable ROI through this truly unique solution.\nOne example is an existing client who has been with us for 6 years. This is a 2,500 employee company that recently adopted Beti. Since allowing their employees to do their own payroll, they reduced their payroll team by half, going from a process that took roughly 4 days before Beti to merely hours with Beti. Beti continues to evolve and raise the bar as we add more functionality and connections to solve complex decisioning, and we are seeing increased inbound inquiries from prospective clients.\nGONE, the industry's first fully automated time-off solution was recently recognized as a Globee award winner for transforming the time-off process. It connects highly complex, traditionally disparate solutions and leverages decisioning logic to automatically approve, deny or warehouse employee time-off requests. Time-off decisions are a hassle for everyone within an organization unless you use GONE.\nThanks to GONE, employees get immediate decisions and managers gain back time and increased scheduling visibility. HR and payroll no longer have to track down managers to verify and decision requests, and GONE significantly reduces after the fact liabilities and related costs. The C-suite benefits from increased confidence in operations and resource management, driving improved productivity and reducing liability.\nWe have a retail client with over 100 stores where each managers control time-off requests differently. The client enabled GONE and built unique rules per store to ensure each manager was in control of their appropriate coverage. Now these managers no longer need to take direct action on request and when the payroll team is prepping payroll, they've eliminated the need for all follow-ups. Their payroll manager stated, GONE to Beti to the next level. Since implementing GONE, this client has automated over 1,000 time-off decisions bringing up hours of nonproductive time.\nI'm very excited about GONE and its ability to streamline time-off requests for the businesses across the globe.\nThrough solution automation, we are helping our clients eliminate decision fatigue across the entire organization, from the C-suite to HR and for managers to employees. This, in turn, creates better employee retention and engagement for all organizations. We are meeting the expectation of today's employees. And once they've experienced Paycom, they don't want to go backwards in technology. In fact, we are seeing more and more returning clients as both user buyers and employees are missing the automation that is lacking in disparate and antiquated competitor solutions they had deployed. At the end of the day, the best product will win, and we are furthering our product advantage.\nWe continue to leverage AI across a wide variety of areas within our organization. We believe our AI approach toward full solution automation will continue to deliver even stronger ROI, value and functionality for our clients.\nOn the international front, we continue to make meaningful progress in the geographies that we rolled out in the last 12 months. Beti is now available for employees in Canada, Mexico, Ireland and the U.K. We continue to win new clients with domestic and foreign employees, thanks to our investments in our global HCM product and our native international payroll.\nOn the sales side, we are seeing strong momentum. Our new outside sales reps are winning more deals earlier than ever before, and we've sold significantly more units in 2024 than we did the same time last year. Just this month, we had our top sales week in company history. Sales is energized. And last week, we added our largest sales class of new reps, placing 67 sales reps in the field across the country. I'm excited about the enthusiasm across our sales division heading into the back half of the year.\nTo sum up, I'm pleased with the progress we are making with our product strategy and with our strategic initiatives. The investments we are making in 2024 and our focus on client value achievement are designed to deliver long-term value to our clients and their employees, which will in turn deliver value to Paycom and its stockholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Craig. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2024, I'd like to say a few words about my future plans here at Paycom.\nI joined this incredible company nearly 19 years ago and had the privilege of shepherding the company from a few million dollars of revenue to one approaching $2 billion in revenues. It has been a career that has surpassed all of my dreams, and I want to thank Chad for bringing me in as a partner in this journey. As a new grandfather, it is time for me to prepare for my next chapter, and I'm announcing my plan to retire from my role as CFO sometime in the next 9 to 12 months. And after that, I expect to remain with Paycom in an advisory role.\nWith that, let's dig into Q2 results by reminding everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Second quarter revenue of $438 million came in at the top end of our range and was up 9% over the comparable prior year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $430 million for the second quarter of 2024, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 9% from the comparable prior year period.\nGAAP net income in the quarter was $68 million or $1.20 per diluted share based on approximately 56.8 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $92 million or $1.62 per diluted share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of nearly $160 million or 36.5% margin was better than expected, primarily due to expense discipline in the quarter.\nWe continue to aggressively invest in areas of AI, automation, international expansion and our value proposition for the client. Adjusted R&D expense was $55 million in the second quarter of 2024 or 14% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $81 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $61 million in the prior year period. We are building more automation on the most automated platform in the industry, which should continue to distance us from the rest of the competition.\nFor Q3 and full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rates to be approximately 28% and 23%, respectively, on a GAAP basis. We estimate Q3 and full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 26%.\nFor the remainder of 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $30 million per quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $346 million and no debt. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% year-over-year.\nDuring the second quarter and into July, the valuation of our stock dropped below that of slower growth and lower margin peers. We opportunistically took advantage of the low stock price to repurchase approximately 790,000 shares between April 1 and July 31 for $120 million. Since July 1 of last year, we have repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares representing approximately 4% of total shares outstanding. Nearly 2 million of that has been repurchased since November of last year.\nEarlier this week, we increased our buyback authorization to $1.5 billion and extended it for another 2-year period. We will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock if and when we see dislocations in valuation relative to our peers.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we paid over $21 million in cash dividends. And earlier this week, the Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-September.\nNow let me turn to guidance. We continue to execute on several strategic initiatives and remain on plan to achieve the 10% growth and 39% adjusted EBITDA margin that we guided to at the beginning of this year. For fiscal 2024, now that we have more visibility into the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range with revenue expected to be in the range of $1.860 billion to $1.875 billion or approximately 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are raising our expected adjusted EBITDA range to $727 million to $737 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $444 million to $449 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $155 million to $159 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range.\nWe have a strong balance sheet, strong free cash flow and significant liquidity. We will continue to invest in areas that will bolster our competitive position and strengthen our client ROI through automation and the user experience.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions.

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll kick off the call with a few highlights from the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss client trends and recent awards. Craig will then review our financials and our guidance before taking questions.\nOur product vision centers around eliminating redundant HR work, eliminating cost and allowing users to recoup valuable time in their day to add value to their organizations. In addition to our single database, which simplifies the client experience and reduces integration costs, another key Paycom differentiator is that employees input and validate their data directly into our HCM solution.\nWith Paycom, employees do their own payroll, fixing errors before they become problems.\nOn our last call, we highlighted 3 key focus areas in 2024, solution automation, client ROI achievement and world-class service. Led by Beti, our solution automation initiatives continue to generate tremendous opportunities for our clients. We released more product enhancements in the first quarter than in the previous 2 quarters combined.\nWe are leveraging AI and decisioning logic across our solution, adding more value and eliminating mundane nonrevenue-generating activities for our clients.\nA recent new client told us that prior to implementing Beti, it would take over 2 days to process payroll. With Beti, they complete the process in only 90 minutes.\nWe've also automated time off decisioning, allowing managers across the country to focus on value-added activities. With GONE, our time off product leverages decisioning logic to automatically approve deny or warehouse time off requests by employees. This is a better experience for employees and delivers both time savings and efficiencies for workforce management and scheduling.\nOn the client ROI achievement front, our success with Beti results in increased client ROI and is resonating with more and more businesses in the marketplace. Our clients already receive industry-leading ROI, and we are focused on accelerating our product road map to drive even more value.\nNow with Beti, clients regularly tell us that their company runs much smoother when their employees do their own payroll, and I know this sentiment is shared across the client base of Beti users. We are changing the way payroll is done and our clients are telling us we're right.\nOn the world-class service front, we are meeting clients where they live to help identify and close any gaps they might be seeing between their respective total available ROI and where they stand today. We are strengthening our client relationships with service and value achievement and I want to thank our employees for their incredible efforts on this front. It is working.\nOur go-to-market strategy continues to emphasize the differentiated nature of our offering and the significant benefits of doing your own payroll with Paycom. We are getting more leads, thanks to Beti, and we are seeing solid demand for our solution.\nAt our recent sales incentive trip, we recognized our first sales rep to sell over $4 million in annual new business. It wasn't that long ago that we celebrated the first sales rep to sell $1 million in annual new business. We believe our unique value proposition separates us from the other disparate offerings in the market that require complex integrations and manual entry activities.\nWe continue to make meaningful progress on the international front as we build on the momentum we achieved in 2023 and early 2024, when we released our global HCM product and announced the launch of native payroll in Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\nToday, we are pleased to announce that we have developed and are launching our native payroll solution in Ireland. In less than a year since we announced our international journey, we are already seeing U.S.-based companies with an international presence look to Paycom as a global provider.\nWhile still early, I'm pleased to see that all the work on our international strategy is paying off. In fact, we recently won a large international sports organization, thanks to our multi-country payroll and HCM offering.\nThis client will process payroll with Beti in multiple countries, and this win represents another proof point for our international strategy. While this is a great win for Paycom, I want to be sure to note that we remain highly focused on our U.S. growth as we still have only an estimated 5% of the total addressable market.\nTo sum up, I'm pleased with the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives, and I look forward to building on the momentum we are seeing.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Thomas\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks, Chad.\nOur service and client relations group continue to work very closely together to drive value for our clients. Usage of our system continues to increase as more employees interact directly with their data. Our average DDX score continues to rise and is above 95% across our client base today. Our innovative technology and our client ROI achievement strategy are key drivers of satisfaction and bolster our world-class service model. In fact, we were very pleased to receive several awards that highlight the strength of our relationship with our clients.\nMost recently, we were recognized as the 2024 winner of the Excellence and Customer Service Award by Business Intelligence Group. It's gratifying to receive recognition from an organization for our hard work and dedicated focus on our clients. This award highlights businesses who are redefining service standards in their industry. This achievement showcases our ability to further drive client ROI while making a positive impact across our client base.\nWe were also named one of the most trustworthy companies in America by Newsweek for the third consecutive year. These awards are a testament to our service model. I'm pleased to see that our relationships with our clients continue to get even stronger.\nFinally, we earned the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award for the second consecutive year, and we're grateful to be recognized among global leaders and workplace culture.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris.\nBefore I review our first quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nFirst quarter revenue of $500 million was up 11% over the comparable prior year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $492 million for the first quarter of 2024, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 11% from the comparable prior year period.\nWe delivered strong net income and adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2024 with GAAP net income of $247 million or $4.37 per diluted share based on approximately 57 million shares. Included in our GAAP results is a onetime noncash stock compensation benefit of $118 million related to the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO performance award. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $147 million or $2.59 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA of nearly $230 million was better than expected primarily due to higher revenue and expense discipline and represented a margin of 45.9% for the quarter. During the first quarter, we paid over $21 million in cash dividends. And earlier this week, the Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-June. We still have approximately $796 million remaining under our buyback authorization as of March 31, 2024.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $45 million in the first quarter of 2024 or 9% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $71 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $55 million in the prior year period. We continue to invest in our long-term future growth in areas of automation, AI and international.\nOur tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 15% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the benefit of the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO performance award during the quarter. For Q2 and the full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rates to be approximately 33% and 22%, respectively, on a GAAP basis. We estimate Q2 and full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 25%.\nQuarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rates are generally due to the timing of stock compensation vesting and related tax effects. For the remainder of 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $33 million per quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $371 million and no debt. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up 8% year-over-year.\nOn the capital expenditure front, our fifth building in Oklahoma City is substantially complete and will be placed into service in the second quarter. While we continue to estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2024, we also expect that percentage to decline beginning in 2025.\nNow let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2024, we are maintaining our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges with revenue expected to be in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.885 billion or approximately 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range.\nWe remain on track with the full year plan we put in place at the beginning of the year and are beginning to see positive responses from our strategic initiatives.\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $434 million to $438 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $151 million to $155 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on executing on our plan and building momentum. We have a differentiated product, an industry-leading value proposition and a solid foundation to build upon.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Before digging into the quarterly results and achievements in 2023, I'd like to discuss today's announcements about the promotion of Chris Thomas to Co-CEO. Following that, I will briefly introduce Chris, who previously served as our COO. Craig will then review our financials and our guidance before taking questions.\nWith that, let's get started. As Founder and CEO of Paycom, my position has provided me the opportunity to work with great leaders who have built Paycom into a world-class HR and payroll software company. One such leader is Chris Thomas. He is someone I have extreme confidence in and a leader I can share responsibilities with at Paycom. I've been preparing this opportunity for Chris and myself to work even more closely together for some time now. Today's announcement further illustrates the trust I have in our leadership.\nPersonally, this is very exciting because it allows me to invest further in the areas that I'm passionate about, which are the ones where I can have the largest impact for our clients. In this new role for Chris, Paycom will be even stronger than ever before. A key area of my continued focus will be product innovation and strategy, and Chris will continue to focus on operating other aspects of the business. Our collaboration has strengthened Paycom, and I'm excited for what we will do going forward.\nIn the last several months, we continue to strengthen our leadership team with the addition of Jason Clark as Chief Administrative Officer; and Steve Sturgis as Chief Marketing Officer. Jason was the CEO of one of the region's largest workers' comp insurance companies. Having worked with Jason in various capacities for about 12 years, I officially brought him into the organization last year knowing this was an ideal fit for him and for Paycom. Steve formerly owned and operated a very successful marketing agency, and I've had the privilege of working with him for about 15 years.\nI'm excited to see him continue to elevate our brand, engage our clients and drive further demand generation for our sales force. This evolution of our organization is exciting, and I believe it will bring significant value to our clients, employees and investors.\nNow I want to discuss our vision for 2024 and then look back on some highlights of 2023. Following a better-than-expected end to 2023, in 2024, we are primarily focused on 3 key areas: world-class service, solution automation and client ROI achievement. Our continued focus is being the leading provider of comprehensive payroll and human capital management solutions in every market we serve. We are bringing the power of Paycom to more employers and employees and showing more organizations the ROI they experience by using our single database software.\nOn the product front, Beti has been one of the products at the leading edge of our AI and automation strategy, delivering tremendous ROI to our clients. A recently commissioned third-party study on Beti highlighted 3 benefit areas. On average, a greater than 80% reduction in errors, a 90% reduction in time processing payroll and improved employee engagement. A leader within the restaurant industry noted that the automation from Beti took days off payroll processing time and that as employee checkers went down, employee engagement went up. Additionally, certain organizations using Beti experienced up to 100% of their end users regularly engaging with our easy-to-use system.\nSolutions like Paycom's GONE tool are expanding automation to other areas of our product suite, namely our time-off application. The rollout of GONE towards the end of 2023 has been going very well. This new product uses AI and decisioning logic to automate all decisions for time-off request, which further enhances both the employee and the manager experience by eliminating conflicts and resolving time-sensitive decisions. Today, clients may make between 20 and 30 decisions or more per year per employee concerning PTO, vacation requests and the denials or approvals that go into staffing decisions.\nGONE eliminates those unnecessary interaction points by providing a consistent and fully automated experience for employees, managers, HR administrators and the business as a whole. With GONE an employee in any industry can request time off at midnight on a Friday and know immediately if it is approved or denied, which GONE has automated all-time off request decisions. It's another example of a product that's a win for our clients, and a win for their employees. We delivered a lot of innovation on the international front in 2023. We launched our global HCM product and now companies of all sizes use this product across 180 countries and in 15 languages and [indiscernible].\nWe developed and launched native payroll in Canada and Mexico. Now we've developed and are launching our native peril solution in the United Kingdom. Our international strategy complements our product strategy and adds to the momentum we are seeing with U.S.-based companies that have an international presence. While still early, we are very excited about the potential impact of this initiative will have on our expanded TAM. While I'm proud of our product developments and international expansion in 2023, I'm even more excited about where we are headed with the product department. As a company, we all know and feel the excitement that is happening within our walls.\nSince 1998, Paycom has changed the way businesses operate through innovation and automation. Our revolutionary product road map will continue to bring new levels of value to our clients. I'm glad to see both growth in our product and in the people we are elevating and bringing back into the organization. The buzz about the future of product innovation across the organization is exciting and encouraging. The client experience is everything to us, and that all starts with our product. We are excited to release more product enhancements and innovations than ever before.\nTo sum up, in 2024, we will continue to be hyper focused on world-class service, solution automation and the client ROI achievement strategies. This means we will continue our emphasis on client ROI and the user experience. I'm confident that the size of our opportunity and our track record for execution to bolster our growth trajectory. I'd like to thank our employees for their important contributions in 2023 and commitment to Paycom. In fact, because of them, Paycom earned many top workplace accolades in 2023, most notably Gallup's Exceptional Workplace Award.\nAdditionally, Newsweek recognized us as one of the most trustworthy organizations and is a top workplace for diversity for parents and families. These accolades mean a lot because it's a reflection of our leadership and the culture we have built. Before turning the call over to Craig, I'd like Chris to briefly introduce himself and discuss his vision for the role. Chris?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Chad. I'm honored to help lead such an incredible organization. I want to personally thank you for the guidance, tools and insights you've provided me through the years. Having had the opportunity to lead approximately 10 departments over my tenure, like product, service, learning, HCM, implementation and tax, to name a few, I feel even more prepared to help lead Paycom into the future.\nI'm proud of our leadership group who has strategized and built the client value achievement strategy. We spent a lot of quality time throughout the year, especially last quarter, having meaningful engagements with our clients, and the feedback has been very encouraging. We are strengthening our relationships and relentlessly pursuing solutions that deliver high ROI for our clients. The innovations in automation and user experience are resonating across our client base, delivering immediate and measurable value to our clients, who'll deliver long-term value to Paycom.\nAs a result, our service and client relations groups are working together more closely than ever before, which is driving further ROI for our clients. We're going to continue to generate even more momentum as we engage clients to help them maximize their value when using our system.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2023 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with solid results with full year 2023 revenue of $1.694 billion, up 23% compared to 2022. Fourth quarter results were better than expected with total revenues of $435 million, representing growth of 17% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth was driven by new business wins, partially offset by lower cross-selling to existing clients.\nWithin total revenues, recurring revenue was $427 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 17% from the comparable prior year period. We delivered strong net income and adjusted EBITDA in 2023. Full year GAAP net income was $341 million or $5.88 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for 2023 was $449 million or $7.75 per diluted share, up 26% from the prior year on a per share basis. In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income of $82 million and non-GAAP net income of $110 million represented $1.43 and $1.93 per diluted share, respectively, based on approximately 57 million shares.\nFull year adjusted EBITDA was $719 million, representing full year margin of 42.5%, up over 30 basis points year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $177 million, representing a quarterly margin of 40.6% for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock or approximately 2% of our shares outstanding for a total of $213 million, and we paid over $21 million in cash dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have repurchased over 6.1 million shares. And when combined with dividends, we have returned nearly $1 billion to stockholders. We still have approximately $800 million remaining under our buyback authorization as of December 31, 2023, and the Board has approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-March. We ended 2023 with approximately 36,800 clients, representing a growth rate of 1% compared to 2022. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 19,500 clients, up 2% compared to 2022. Digging in the client mix details and using client figures based on parent company groupings, client count for companies with greater than 500 employees was up 11% year-over-year, and client count for companies with greater than 2,000 employees was up nearly 18% year-over-year.\nTotal number of employee records stored in our system in 2023 was $6.8 million. Paycom's annual revenue retention rate in 2023 was 90% compared to 91% in 2022 with attrition concentrated primarily at the low end of our market. Note that our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon included additional information about a recent modification in our annual revenue retention rate calculation.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 or 11.6% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $52 million in the prior year period. We continue to invest in the long-term future growth opportunity, including in areas of automation, AI and innovation. Our tax rate for the year ended 2023 was 28% on a GAAP basis. For the full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 29% on a GAAP basis and approximately 25% on a non-GAAP basis. In fiscal year 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense as a percent of revenue to be approximately 8.5%. This does not reflect any potential onetime adjustment related to the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO performance award.\nWe will provide details on this onetime adjustment, if any, when we report first quarter earnings. Turning to the balance sheet. Even after the substantial buybacks and dividends paid in the quarter, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $294 million and zero debt. Cash from operations was $485 million in 2023, representing an increase of 33%. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOn the capital expenditure front, our fifth building in Oklahoma City is substantially complete. We estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2024. Now let me turn to guidance. Our approach to guidance remains consistent with our historical approach and that we guide to what we can see and factor in relevant trends, opportunities and potential constraints.\nFor 2024, we are also factoring in a wider range of sensitivities such as fluctuations of interest rates and the outcomes of several near-term strategic initiatives. For fiscal 2024, we expect revenues in the range of $1.860 billion to $1.885 billion or approximately 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range, which is consistent with the target growth range we provided on our Q3 earnings call.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $720 million to $730 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $494 million to $497 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $218 million to $222 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 44% at the midpoint of the range.\n2023 delivered solid results for Paycom. The strength of our product and the client initiatives we have in place give me confidence that 2024 will be a solid year of execution. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to strengthen our competitive position to meet the demand of our expanding TAM.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions.

My name is Chasson, and I'll be the moderator for today's call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to our host, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJames Samford\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the third quarter 2023. Certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on our current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties.\nThese risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. Any forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nAlso, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today.\nWe delivered solid results in the third quarter with very strong profitability. All focus on Paycom innovations that are transforming our industry and strengthening our competitive position. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.\nThroughout our 25-year history, Paycom innovations have been transforming the payroll and HCM industry. And now we have fundamentally shifted how businesses use core HR and payroll products. We started transforming the industry in 1998 by moving payroll to the web. We have made many innovations in those 25 years, but none more important than do-it-yourself payroll for employees with BETI. This is a paradigm shift for our industry and delivers tremendous value to our clients when employees do their own payroll.\nAlong with our focus on automating and innovating all of our current products, we're continuing to enhance our global HCM and payroll product for international enterprises. Today, we announced that we are expanding our global payroll product to include Mexico. During the third quarter, employees in Canada started doing their own payroll with BETI and now employees in Mexico can, too.\nWe are continuing to help clients navigate to the new way of doing things. And as a result, nearly 2/3 of our clients have made the shift to BETI. For most employees, the value of the perfect payroll is oftentimes immeasurable. If their check is perfect, they don't need to borrow money from a friend or family member to get through the weekend or make a bill payment. How do you measure the value of that? We're getting better and better at helping employers measure the full value available to them when payrolls are perfect.\nA portion of that value is easy to calculate because it's the value they receive by the elimination of after-the-fact payroll errors that require correction payroll runs, manual checks, voided checks, direct deposit reversals, additional wires, tax adjustments, W2Cs, et cetera, et cetera. Perfect payrolls eliminate these common after-the-fact payroll corrections that would otherwise be billable. So the more employees do their own payroll, the greater the savings delivered to the client from Paycom future billings, which results in lower related revenue recognized by Paycom.\nI'd like to thank our employees for their consistent execution and their commitment to our long-term strategy. I also want to wish Paycom a very happy 25th birthday. I look forward to many more. And as many of you know, we're just getting started. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter results for 2023 and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered fundamentally strong results this quarter with solid revenue and earnings growth. Revenue of $406.3 million was up approximately 22% compared to the prior year period that came in below our guidance range as a result of lower-than-expected service revenues and unscheduled payroll runs. As Chad mentioned, BETI adoption and usage creates tremendous value to clients as they experience perfect payrolls and eliminate errors, corrections and unscheduled payrolls, which would otherwise be billable items.\nIn addition, our CRR teams continue to focus on BETI adoption and overall system usage, which resulted in lower cross-selling revenues. We delivered very strong GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. Net income was $75.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares and adjusted EBITDA was $165.6 million, representing third quarter margin of nearly 41%, up over 300 basis points year-over-year.\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2023 was $102.4 million or $1.77 per diluted share, up 39% from the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased over $76 million worth of stock and paid nearly $22 million in cash dividends. As of September 30, 2023, we have retired nearly 5 million shares and when combined with dividends, we have returned over $700 million to stockholders. We still have $1 billion remaining under our buyback authorization and the Board has approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-December.\nAdjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2023 was $94.3 million, representing 23.2% of revenues. We continue to hire top talent to expand our sales footprint and invest in marketing to drive lead volume. Adjusted R&D expense was $46.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 or 11.4% of total revenues, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $69 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe capitalization rate increased approximately 33% in the quarter as we continue to invest in new products and support our international expansion efforts. Third quarter GAAP tax rate came in at 26.3%. For the full year of 2023, we expect our effective income tax rate to come in at approximately 29% on a GAAP basis and approximately 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $484 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023.\nNow let me turn to guidance. Throughout 2023, we have been seeing moderating upside to our guidance model, which corresponded with increases embedded usage and macro headwinds from inflation that may impact each client differently. Now that more clients are achieving the ROI that BETI has to offer, it has eliminated certain billable items, which is cannibalizing a portion of our services and unscheduled revenues.\nWith 10 months of data from increased BETI usage, we are incorporating the impact that our clients' ROI achievement has on our model. Based on these factors, we expect fourth quarter 2023 total revenues to be in the range of $420 million to $425 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 14% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $169 million to $174 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% at the midpoint of the range.\nWith our Q3 results and our Q4 guidance, we now expect fiscal 2023 revenues to be in the range of $1.679 billion to $1.684 billion or approximately 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $712 million to $717 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 43% at the midpoint of the range.\nCombining our expected revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we're still on track to reach the Rule of 65 in 2023. As we look out to 2024, we have a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will further strengthen the value clients receive from our offering. We are making strategic performance and client value decisions that we feel are best for our long-term relationship with our clients. Our mission is to ensure and achieve client value, and that is our focus.\nOur guidance for the next 15 months assumes the impact from the strategic revenue decisions we are and will be making. As a result, we believe it is prudent for us to set expectations for 2024 year-over-year revenue growth of between 10% and 12%. We'll have more visibility when we provide formal guidance in early February. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered very solid results in the second quarter, and we continue to expand our opportunity both within and outside the U.S. I'll start with highlights from the second quarter and progress on our initiatives. Following that, Craig will review our financials and guidance, and then we'll take questions.\nSecond quarter 2023 revenue of approximately $401 million represented strong growth of 27% year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $157 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of roughly 39%, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. We are delivering a solid combination of growth in high margins while maintaining a disciplined investment strategy in product and international expansion.\nOn the product front, the ROI that our clients are achieving from Beti is unquestionable. We recently commissioned a total economic impact study from Forrester Consulting that quantified the savings from using Paycom and Beti including a 90% reduction in labor for payroll processing and saving HR and accounting teams more than 2,600 hours per year. Companies that are not adopting Beti are missing out on a significant opportunity for savings from the structural change to how payroll should be done.\nWith millions of employees already doing their own payroll and organization seeing incredible ROI with Beti, there's no reason not to adopt it. The product is working as we anticipated, and our messaging is resonating. So we will remain disciplined in promoting the power of Beti to new and existing clients. In April 2023, we launched access to our global human capital management software in more than 180 countries and in 15 languages and dialex.\nToday, we announced that we have expanded our HCM solutions to include self-service payroll for organizations with Canadian employees. Now more North American businesses will be able to improve their payroll processing by giving their employees a more transparent and user-friendly experience in Canada with Beti. We are seeing continued success selling across our entire target market range, and Our efforts up market continue to be strong.\nWith our recent launch into Canada, we've opened up a new large cross-border opportunity. As we continue to expand our geographic reach, I expect our move up market to continue to accelerate. As a result, we are redefining our target market range to include organizations with greater than 10,000 employees, which represents an enterprise segment that our sales reps can now directly pursue.\nWith our new expanded market opportunity, we now estimate our market share is well below 5%. This expansion gives me confidence that we can grow at an impressive pace for many years to come.\nIn addition to launching our payroll services in Canada, our product development team also rolled out 2 significant tools in our software, Everyday and the Client Action Center. Everyday allows employees to get paid on a daily basis. Unlike other products on the market, with Everyday, employees access their earned pay early without being charged a fee and employers are not exposed to potential losses from all factors that impact pay, including early departures, garnishments or benefit deductions to be collected. Everyday is a fully compliant payroll as opposed to a pay advance like many other daily pay services.\nThe Client Action Center furthers our dedication to creating software that simplifies the lives of our clients by providing them with an intuitive dashboard within the Paycom mobile app. This new tool makes it even easier for our clients to take action and get updates on service-related items. We've received great feedback from clients on this streamlined approach since we rolled it out in June.\nFinally, Paycom was recently recognized as one of America's Greatest Workplaces in 2023 by Newsweek. The award highlights companies dedicated to providing employees with an enjoyable work environment, but also fosters growth and development opportunities. In addition, for the second year in a row, comparably named Paycom one of the best career growth opportunities among all companies.\nIn summary, our highly differentiated product and realized client ROI continue to drive our strong results. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to excellence as we continue to change the way payroll is done.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nBefore I review our second quarter results for 2023 and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe delivered solid results this quarter with revenue of $401.1 million, up 26.6% compared to the prior year period. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $64.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2023 or 39% of total revenues compared to $119.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues or up 130 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $94.3 million or $1.62 per diluted share, up 29.1% from the prior year period.\nSecond quarter GAAP tax rate came in higher than expected at 30.5%. For the full year 2023, we now anticipate our effective income tax rate to come in slightly higher at approximately 29.5% on a GAAP basis and approximately 27% on a non-GAAP basis.\nDemand trends remained strong, particularly upmarket. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $394.5 million for the second quarter of 2023 representing 98.4% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 26.6% from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2023 was $100.4 million or 25% of revenues. We continue to aggressively spend on marketing and sales ahead of future growth.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $42.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 or 10.6% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $48.1 million in the prior year period. We continue to invest in new products and expanded geographic offerings.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents of $537 million and total debt of $29 million. Additionally, we announced today that we have expanded our revolver from $650 million to $1 billion. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up approximately 13% year-over-year.\nNow let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are raising our outlook and now expect revenue in the range of $1.715 billion to $1.717 billion or approximately 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $722 million to $724 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range.\nWith these strong results and outlook, we are well positioned to reach the Rule of 67. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $410 million to $412 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 23% at the midpoint of the range.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $156 million to $158 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 38% at the midpoint of the range. We paid our first quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share in June, and the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-September.\nPaycom is in a strong financial position and executing well against a very large market opportunity. Our focus on delivering strong revenue growth and attractive adjusted EBITDA margins remains top priorities, and I am pleased with the consistency of our execution and the resiliency of our business model. We look forward to delivering continued strong results as many of our initiatives gained traction in 2023 and 2024.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Thank you for attending the Paycom Software First Quarter 2023 Quarterly Results Call. My name is Matt, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to our host, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. James, please go ahead.\n\nJames Samford\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the first quarter 2023.

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on a variety of initiatives. I'll start with highlights from the first quarter. Then I'll discuss some of our plans for the remainder of the year. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance and discuss our new dividend policy. Then we will take questions. With that, let's get started. .\nOur 2023 first quarter revenue of approximately $452 million came in very strong, up 28% year-over-year, with strong recurring revenue growth from new clients. First quarter adjusted EBITDA also came in very strong at $221 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of roughly 49%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. With our updated full year 2023 guidance, we are well positioned to exceed our initial outlook for a solid Rule of 65.\nOn the product front, BETI continues to be a key differentiator in the market, with employee self-service payroll continuing to drive strong client additions. The industry transformation to more efficient HCM and payroll processes is accelerating. And now with BETI, payroll processes can be automated to deliver perfect payroll. Using BETI, employees do their own payroll. Employee usage is a key differentiator, and new clients are coming to Paycom for exactly that. With 95% of database interactions being completed by the employees of our clients as measured by the DDX, we are changing the way employees engage with HCM solutions.\nOur product and go-to-market strategy are working. I just returned from our annual President's Club meeting with our top salespeople, and I couldn't be more excited about the tone of the conversations and enthusiasm for our product, especially around employee usage and BETI.\nWe are having increasing success at market with continued rapid growth at the upper end of our target market range. Large organizations benefit tremendously from simplifying their HCM and payroll needs with our single database solution.\nWe have 5% of the TAM today. However, our TAM has increased now that we've laid the groundwork for a global platform, beginning with global HCM, which further strengthens our value proposition with our largest clients.\nTo sum up, we are executing well with a highly differentiated product and go-to-market strategy. Our addressable market opportunities continue to expand, and we are pleased to enhance our long-term commitment to stockholder return with the initiation of the quarterly dividend program.\nI'd like to thank our employees for helping lay the foundation for another record-breaking year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nChief Financial Officer, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nBefore I review our first quarter results for 2023 and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe delivered very strong results this quarter with revenue of $451.6 million, up 27.8% compared to the prior year period. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119.3 million or $2.06 per diluted share, up 29.8% compared to the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $220.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 or 48.8% of total revenues compared to $170.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 48.1% of total revenues. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $142.7 million or $2.46 per diluted share, up 28.9% from the prior year period.\nOur revenue growth was driven by strong demand, new business wins and new product adoption. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $444.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, representing 98.4% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 27.6% from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2023 was $98.1 million or 21.7% of revenues. We have been aggressively investing in marketing to drive strong demo leads that complement our outside sales model.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $37.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 or 8.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $55.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $42.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting continued investment in new products.\nFor Q2 and full year 2023, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP basis and approximately 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $506 million and total debt of $29 million. Cash from operations was $146.1 million in the first quarter, representing an increase of 24.6%. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up approximately 10% year-over-year.\nNow let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are raising our outlook and now expect revenue in the range of $1,713,000,000 to $1,715,000,000 or approximately 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $717 million to $719 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. With these strong results and outlook, we are well positioned to exceed the Rule of 65.\nFor the second quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $397 million to $399 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $152 million to $154 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 38% at the midpoint of the range.\nFinally, after 25 years of rapidly growing Paycom into a highly profitable company, we're expanding our capital allocation strategy. On May 1, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend program that we expect to initiate in mid-May. In 2023, we project Paycom will generate greater than $1.7 billion in revenues, over $700 million in adjusted EBITDA and strong operating cash flow, all of which continue to grow. We believe Paycom is in a unique position to return value to stockholders in the form of a dividend and still have the necessary resources to aggressively pursue growth opportunities.\nSince [ 2016 ], we returned a total of nearly $600 million to stockholders through stock buybacks, and we have a $1.1 billion buyback authorization still in place. Today's dividend policy announcement reflects our confidence and the resilience of our long-term growth opportunity, the strength of our balance sheet and the profitability of our business model. We intend to pay a dividend at an annual rate of $1.50 per share with a first quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-June, subject to Board approval.\n2023 is off to a great start. We are in a strong financial and strong competitive position in a large and attractive addressable market. And we have a long runway to continue to deliver rapid organic revenue growth, high profit margins and attractive cash flows.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2022 with very strong results, and I'd like to thank all of our employees for the consistent hard work and execution that drove 4 consecutive quarters of revenue growth of 30% or more over the respective prior year periods.\nI'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter and our full year 2022 results and high-level expectations for 2023. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.\nOur 2022 fourth quarter revenue of approximately $371 million came in very strong, up 30% year-over-year, bringing our full year 2022 revenue to $1.375 billion, also up 30% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA also came in very strong at $164 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44%, bringing our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to $580 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%. The sum of our 2022 revenue growth rate and adjusted EBITDA margin resulted in us hitting the Rule of 72.\nWith our full year 2023 guidance, we are once again starting the year strong with outlook for a solid Rule of 65. As a reminder, we guide to what we can see based on our existing recurring revenue, new business sales and anticipated new starts in the near term. I'm pleased with the momentum we are carrying into the new year.\nOn the product front, 2022 was a very strong year for Paycom benefiting from our first full year of rolling out BETI, our differentiated employee self-service payroll solution. We are seeing strong demand trends that position us to deliver another year of rapid profitable growth in 2023. We are leading an industry transformation by making payroll and HCM processes more efficient for both employees and businesses by eliminating manual tasks, improving accuracy and reducing liability exposure caused when payroll and HCM is done in accurately.\nWith BETI, employees are doing their own payroll by interfacing directly with their data and a self-service, easy-to-use software. A recent study conducted by Ernst & Young found that the average organization has a 20% inaccuracy rate when it comes to payrolls, which results in lost revenue, hours wasted correcting errors and increased exposure to potential lawsuits and fines.\nEach of these mistakes cost an average of $291 and could cost upwards of $705 for unentered nonproductive time errors. So you can see how costly these errors become over time. In fact, over the course of the year, a 1,000-employee company could potentially incur almost $1 million in unnecessary costs, correcting common payroll mistakes. BETI automates the payroll processes to deliver perfect payroll and employees are empowered to identify and correct errors ahead of time so that everybody wins.\nOur marketing plan in 2022 continued to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spend aggressively on advertising. At the same time, our deliberate investments in marketing are delivering high-margin revenues and we saw improving operating leverage in the sales and marketing throughout 2022.\nWe continue to be pulled upmarket in 2022 with the fastest-growing revenue segment of our business coming from clients with greater than 2,000 employees. We are seeing increasing demand from larger organizations that are recognizing the opportunity to simplify their HCM needs. And Paycom is well positioned to benefit from this trend. With only approximately 5% of the TAM today, there's still plenty of runway ahead for us to expand our market share.\nPaycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2022. As a workplace, we were named one of America's most trusted companies, as well as Best Company for Women, and we received a Top Workplace in Oklahoma award for a 10th consecutive year. These awards are a testament to our hard work, our thriving corporate culture and our client focus. As of December 31, 2022, our headcount stood at over 6,300 employees, up 18% year-over-year as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high-quality talent to further bolster our future growth.\nAdditionally, I want to congratulate the 2022 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Tre'Vius Hodges-Tomlinson from Texas Christian University. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be an Oklahoman.\nTo sum up, our focus on the employee experience and client ROI continue to fuel our strong results and we are executing well. I'm very excited about the long list of new innovative opportunities we will be pursuing in 2023 and beyond. I'd like to thank our employees for helping to make 2022 such a strong year and we are set up for another great year in 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nBefore I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe ended the year with very strong results with full year 2022 revenue of $1.375 billion, up 30.3% compared to 2021. Fourth quarter results were excellent, with total revenues of $370.6 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth was driven by strong demand, new business wins and adoption of recent new product offerings.\nWithin total revenues, recurring revenue was $364 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period. We ended 2022 with approximately 36,600 clients, representing a growth rate of 8% compared to 2021. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 19,100 clients, also up 8% compared to 2021. Total number of employee records increased 14% year-over-year in 2022 to 6.5 million.\nPaycom's annual revenue retention rate in 2022 was 93%, which was consistent with our recent 4-year average of 93% and up more than 200 basis points from the prior 4-year period average of 91%. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $312.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.3%. For the full year 2022, our adjusted gross margin was 84.9%.\nAdjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $87.3 million or 23.5% of revenues. Our marketing strategy in 2022 has been very effective at driving high-quality demo leads. With the revenue generated from prior period investments, we saw a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues for the year. We plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2023.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $36.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 9.9% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $51.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $44 million in the prior year period. We have a very strong pipeline of product development opportunities in 2023 that we believe will create tremendous value for our clients and for Paycom.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $163.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 44.2% of total revenues compared to $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% of total revenues. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was $579.7 million or 42.2% of total revenues compared to $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues in 2021, representing over 240 basis points of margin expansion.\nOur GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $80 million or $1.38 per diluted share versus $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods.\nFor the full year 2022, our GAAP net income was $281.4 million or $4.84 per diluted share, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $100.2 million or $1.73 per diluted share versus $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nFor the full year 2022, our non-GAAP net income was $357.2 million or $6.14 per diluted share versus $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share in the prior year period, up 37% year-over-year. For Q1 and full year 2023, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP basis and approximately 26% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $401 million and total debt of $29 million. During 2022, we repurchased approximately 365,000 shares for a total of nearly $100 million. Through December 31, 2022, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.7 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $590 million, and we currently have $1.1 billion remaining in our buyback program.\nCash from operations was $365 million in 2022, representing an increase of 14.3%. The new requirement in 2022 to capitalize instead of expense R&D costs resulted in approximately $27 million in additional income tax payments that would have been deferred under previous law. This impacted both our operating cash flow and free cash flow as compared to 2021. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFor 2023, we anticipate stock compensation to be approximately $120 million. On the capital expenditure front, we're in full construction of our fifth building in Oklahoma City. And we now estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2023.\nNow let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.702 billion or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $700 million to $702 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41% at the midpoint of the range. Once again, we are starting the year's guidance at the Rule of 65.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $443 million to $445 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $210 million to $212 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 48% at the midpoint of the range.\n2022 was a very strong year for Paycom, reflecting the strength of prior year investments and consistent execution. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to meet the strong demands we are experiencing.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions.

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered another very strong quarter with a focus on high-quality revenue growth that produces world-class margins. I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights and then turn it over to Craig to review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions.\nOur third quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $334 million came in very strong, up 30% year-over-year, with rapid recurring revenue growth driven by new business sales. Demand for self-service solutions that enable employees to interact directly with their data continues to be strong, and feedback on self-service payroll remains very positive.\nAt the center of our automation strategy is BETI, which is how businesses and their employees win in payroll. BETI is the future of payroll, and already nearly half of our clients have embraced self-service payroll. Our go-to-market strategy includes 54 outside sales teams that focus on penetrating their respective territories. And we augment their sales efforts with marketing and advertising that drive lead volumes, brand awareness and the call to action. Our efforts are producing strong demo leads and our new brand campaign is driving strong recognition across our target market range.\nWe are also seeing a surge in organic lead referrals coming directly from employees. As more employees experienced BETI and Paycom's comprehensive employee self-service solutions, many are seeking to bring us into the current workplace. Just like in the consumer world, employees don't want to go backwards in technology. And with Paycom, employees get the best HCM user experience and the most control over their data interactions.\nEmployee users are becoming Paycom advocates. And when they get promoted in their current position or move on to a new organization, they are becoming strong influencers. We have a long runway to go, and our multifaceted go-to-market strategy should help deliver rapid new business growth for many years to come.\nTo sum up, we are delivering high-quality profitable revenue growth. Based on our strong financial results to date and expectations for the remainder of the year, achievement of our full year guidance for 30% revenue growth and 41% adjusted EBITDA margin puts us back into the pre-pandemic Rule of 70. Our differentiated product strategy focused on employee experience and self-service payroll is producing outstanding fundamentals with accelerating revenue growth in 2022, expanding adjusted EBITDA margins and strong cash flows.\nI want to thank our employees for their focus and commitment to Paycom. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nThird quarter 2022 results were very strong, with total revenues of $334.2 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth is being fueled by strong demand for our differentiated solution and strong new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $328.2 million for the third quarter, representing 98% of total revenues and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $280.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.9%. Our focus on high-quality revenue produces world-class margins, and we remain on target to achieve strong full year adjusted gross margins of approximately 85%.\nAdjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $85.8 million or 25.7% of revenues compared to 25.9% of revenues in the prior year period. Adjusted R&D expense was $37.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 or 11.2% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $52 million in the third quarter compared to $40.7 million in the prior year period. Our investments in sales and marketing and innovation are fueling our market share gains, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas to drive our future growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $126 million in the third quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues compared to $89.7 million in the prior year or 35% of total revenues. I am pleased with the 270 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion that we saw in the quarter, which reflects the strength of our business model and flow-through of high-margin revenue upside.\nGAAP net income for the third quarter was $52.2 million or $0.90 per diluted share versus $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $73.4 million or $1.27 per diluted share versus $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $317 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.85 billion in the third quarter of 2022.\nNow let me turn to guidance. With our very strong third quarter and the strength of our recurring revenue model, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $1.371 billion to $1.373 billion or 30% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $560 million to $562 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% at the midpoint of the range and a 120 basis point expansion from the prior year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $366 million to $368 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 29% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $144 million to $146 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of roughly 40% at the midpoint of the range.\nCombining our 2022 guidance for revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margin, we are now expecting to exceed the Rule of 70, which is at least 5 points greater than the Rule of 65 we achieved in 2021. We have a long runway for continued high-margin revenue growth. Our fundamentals continue to improve throughout 2022, and we have strong momentum heading into 2023.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We had another very strong quarter. I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights and then turn it over to Craig to review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions.\nOur second quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $317 million, came in very strong, up 31% year-over-year, with continued strength in recurring revenue from new business sales. We continue to see strong demand for self-service payroll and automation of human capital management as more companies and their employees embrace innovative solutions like BETI.\nWe have been leading the employee usage initiative for years, and our efforts are paying off. When data interactions on our platform are performed by employees, our clients realize the ROI that self-service promises. At the core of our employee usage strategy is BETI, which we believe is how businesses and their employees win in payroll.\nIf any business is doing the employees' payroll for them, that business is doing both itself and its employees a disservice. The only way a company wins at payroll is by having the employees do it themselves. It makes no sense in the year 2022 for any company to continue to transfer data inefficiently through multiple systems or manual archaic processes. BETI is the future of payroll and already over 13,000 clients or nearly 40% of our client base have embraced BETI. That's great progress. But as I've said, I expect all clients will eventually deploy BETI in order to finally experience the correct way to do payroll.\nWe are reinforcing this message through our marketing efforts. Our recently launched new ad campaign calls on businesses and their employees to eliminate unnecessary activities and the early feedback has been very positive.\nOverall, our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads and brand recognition across our target market range. In particular, we continue to see strong leads from larger clients, which is driving average revenue per client higher and an important contributor to our strong growth.\nOn the sales front, our 54 outside sales team continued to perform well, driving deeper penetration and market share gains into our target geographies. While we estimate we have roughly half of the country covered geographically, we only have approximately 5% of a very large and growing TAM. We have a long runway for rapid growth for many years to come.\nTo sum up, we finished the first half of 2022 with very strong financial results. With our expectation for the second half of the year, 2022 has become a year of growth acceleration and margin expansion. Our differentiated product strategy focused on employee usage. And self-service payroll is resonating with prospects, and we are onboarding new clients at a very strong pace. I want to thank our employees for making this quarter another milestone growth quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Second quarter 2022 results were excellent with total revenues of $316.9 million, representing growth 31% over the comparable prior year period.\nIn Q2, we had very strong recurring revenue growth, predominantly from new client additions over the past year. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for easy-to-use employee-focused solutions and our success in attracting new business wins.\nWithin total revenues, recurring revenue was $311.5 million for the second quarter, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $268.2 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.6%, and we are on target to achieve strong full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 85%.\nAdjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $82.7 million or 26.1% of revenues compared to 26.6% of revenues in the prior year period. We continue to see strong return on investment from our advertising spend and plan to continue to invest aggressively in marketing and advertising through the remainder of 2022.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $33.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 10.7% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $48.1 million in the second quarter compared to $38 million in the prior year period. We will continue to invest in innovation in our world-class products.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $119.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues compared to $87 million in the prior year or 35.9% of total revenues. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $57.4 million or $0.99 per diluted share versus $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares.\nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $73 million or $1.26 per diluted share versus $56.5 million or $0.97 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 27% on a GAAP basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $279 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2 billion in the second quarter of 2022. We recently increased our liquidity through an expanded revolving line of credit of $650 million, and a delayed draw term loan that allows us to borrow up to an additional $750 million as needed. Potential uses of proceeds include, but are not limited to, general corporate purposes, capital expenditures and stock buybacks.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we took advantage of a dislocation in the stock market and repurchased approximately 360,000 shares for a total of roughly $100 million. Through June 30, 2022, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.65 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $588 million, and we currently have $550 million remaining in our buyback program.\nNow let me turn to guidance. We are raising our full year 2022 guidance as a result of very strong second quarter financial performance and the continued strength of demand trends. We now expect revenue in the range of $1.354 billion to $1.356 billion or 28% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $546 million to $548 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range.\nFor the third quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $327 million to $329 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $117 million to $119 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% at the midpoint of the range.\nWith only 5% share of a growing TAM, we have a long runway for continued high-margin revenue growth for years to come. Our differentiated solutions and go-to-market strategy, particularly with BETI, are working well in driving new client growth and higher revenue per client. Combining our raised 2022 guidance for revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margin guidance implies we are well on our way to deliver a material improvement over the Rule of 65 we achieved in 2021.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions.

I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of the quarter, then I'll focus on the opportunities that I expect to drive strong performance going forward. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions.\nOur 2022 first quarter revenue of approximately $354 million came in very strong, up 30% year-over-year and was well ahead of expectations, thanks to strong growth in recurring revenue from new business sales and modestly better revenue from seasonal forms, filings and adjustments. This quarter has set us up really well to deliver strong financial performance for the remainder of the year, and we are raising our full year guidance as a result. With our new full year outlook for revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, I now believe we can exceed the Rule of 65.\nEmployee usage continues to trend higher as more companies embrace our self-service solutions and push ownership of the data out to the employee. Increasing employee usage is a key component of the ROI that our clients realize and we believe our employee usage strategy is a competitive advantage and a driver of our very strong growth. Already well over 1/4 of our clients have implemented and/or in the process of implementing BETI, our most advanced employee usage payroll experience to date. In less than a year, over 10,000 of our clients have embraced BETI as the right way to do payroll. BETI is fundamentally a better way to run all payroll processes to the benefit of the employer and employees. We will continue to innovate BETI to deliver even more value to our clients, making it even more compelling. BETI is the future of payroll.\nOur marketing plan continues to perform very well, delivering strong demo leads and brand recognition across our target market. We are also having a lot of success with our retargeting efforts and leveraging our digital assets. We recently launched a new ad campaign highlighting how employees have been given the wrong tools for their jobs. With Paycom, employees have the right HCM tools at their fingertips. Our marketing efforts target employee usage at both large and small clients, and we're having great success attracting new clients which is a key component of our rapid revenue growth.\nOn the sales front, I'm pleased with the execution and progress we are making to further penetrate the markets we are in. I just returned from our President's Club meeting in Florida with our top sales reps, and it was fantastic to see how everyone is energized and aligned with our go-to-market strategy. Just a few years ago, we celebrated leading sales reps who sold over $1 million in a year. Today, we are celebrating sales reps exceeding $2 million in sales in a year.\nHolly Faurot has done an outstanding job aligning the sales organization, and the collaboration with the marketing organization is working very well. In fact, both organizations recently received Best Marketing Department and Best Sales Department Awards. These awards are in addition to the awards we received for Best Companies for Women and Forbes List of Best Midsize Employers in Top Workplaces. I am more confident than ever that we have the right team and culture in place to achieve our growth expectations. As a reminder, we only have approximately 5% of a very large and growing TAM and a long runway for rapid growth for many years to come.\nAlso, I want to say thank you to Jon Evans, who is with Paycom for 8 years and was our COO for 4 of those years as he took over for Stacey Pezold. Jon did a great job for this company. Like anyone who does a great job for Paycom, their DNA exists in the company long after they're gone. We are always excited to turn over the department to the next generation of leadership such as Justin Long, and we know he'll take this group to the next level, as has been proven every time we make strategic moves like this.\nTo sum up, we kicked off the year with a great first quarter and are entering the second quarter with very strong momentum. Our differentiated strategy, our people and the value we are delivering to our clients are fueling our long-term growth. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and exceptional performance this quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nFirst quarter 2022 results were excellent, with total revenues of $353.5 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. In Q1, we had very strong recurring revenue growth from strong starts and modestly better-than-expected annual forms, filings and adjustments revenue. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for easy-to-use employee-focused solutions and our success in attracting new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $348.2 million for the first quarter, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period.\nTotal adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $306 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 86.6%, and we remain on target to achieve strong full year adjusted gross margin in the range of 85% to 86%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $72.1 million or 20.4% of revenues compared to 21.8% of revenues in the prior year period. We continue to see strong return on investment from our advertising spend and plan to continue to invest aggressively in marketing and advertising throughout 2022.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $29.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 8.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $42.9 million in the first quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year period. Innovation continues to be a key area of investment for us, and we have a deep pipeline of projects that we are pursuing. Adjusted EBITDA was $170.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 48.1% of total revenues compared to $133 million in the prior year or 48.9% of total revenues.\nOur GAAP net income for the first quarter was $91.9 million or $1.58 per diluted share versus $64.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $110.6 million or $1.90 per diluted share versus $85.9 million or $1.47 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $361 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022.\nNow let me turn to guidance. Based on the very strong first quarter results and the strong demand trends we are seeing, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $1.333 billion to $1.335 billion or 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $533 million to $535 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range. Combined revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we now expect to exceed the Rule of 65 that we reported last year.\nFor the second quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $308 million to $310 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $111 million to $113 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% at the midpoint of the range.\nThe strength of our results and our raised guidance clearly reflect our confidence in the market demand for our solutions and the success we are having in expanding our market share from the roughly 5% share of the TAM that we have today. We have a high-margin recurring revenue model, a strong balance sheet, and with the investments we are making and the success of our sales model, we are very well positioned to deliver another year of rapid revenue growth and robust adjusted EBITDA margin. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

Chad?\n\nChad R. Richison\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2021 with a very strong quarter, and I'd like to thank all of our employees for the outstanding effort they put in to making 2021 a great success. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2021 results. Then I will review some of our notable achievements throughout the year. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.\n2021 was a very strong year for Paycom. We extended our platform to the employee even further through innovations like BETI, which enables employees to do their own payroll, and we are seeing very strong adoption and record employee usage as measured by the DDX. Strong demand continues to bolster our sales momentum, and record new client sales in 2021 have positioned us to deliver another year of rapid growth in 2022.\nFor years, I have been predicting the end of the old model, whereby HR and payroll personnel's routine of inputting data for employees, is replaced by a self-service model that provides employees direct access to the database. The old model is dying and that is good for both the business and the employee. Paycom is leading this transformation. We will continue to automate the processes that generate maximum ROI for our clients.\nOur 2021 fourth quarter revenue of $285 million came in very strong, up 29% year-over-year. Our full year 2021 revenue of $1,056,000,000 grew 25% compared to 2020. Employee usage, which is at a record high, is a key driver of revenue retention, and I'm pleased to announce that Paycom's annual revenue retention rate increased once again to 94% this year, which is a validation of the strong ROI our clients are achieving.\nOur full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $419 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 40%. The sum of our 2021 revenue growth rate and adjusted EBITDA margin resulted in us hitting the Rule of 65, reflecting the solid demand for our solutions and the profitability of our business model and was well ahead of our stated goal to reach the Rule of 60. As you can see with our full year 2022 guidance, we are starting strong with the Rule of 65.\nOur marketing plan throughout 2021 continue to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spent aggressively on advertising. More importantly, our sales teams are successfully closing these leads, which is the key driver to our revenue growth. In her first year as our Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot has executed fabulously on her sales plan, and I'm very pleased with the coordination we are seeing across the sales and marketing organizations.\nWe are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems that are failing both the employees who struggle to use them and the businesses that struggle just to make them work. Our proven single-database platform just works better, and we continue to differentiate ourselves with easy-to-use solutions that enhance the employee experience and generate maximum ROI for our clients.\nIn response to increasing demand in 2021, we expanded the upper end of our target client size range from 5,000 to 10,000 employees as we are seeing success selling to larger clients. We are also concurrently expanding geographically to meet the increased demand. In addition to the Manhattan office we announced a few months ago, we recently opened 4 outside sales offices in the following locations: Las Vegas, Jacksonville, New England and South Jersey. We have now opened 5 offices in the last 5 months. That said, I'd remind everyone that we still only have approximately 5% of the TAM today, so there's plenty of runway ahead to expand and continue to capture market share.\nPaycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2021. Our latest innovation, BETI, was awarded a Top HR Product of the Year honor. As a workplace, we earned a top 20 ranking in best places to work in the U.S. by Top Workplaces, and we were named a top workplace in Oklahoma for the ninth consecutive year. We were also named the best company for women to work. These awards are a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture. As of December 31, 2021, our headcount stood at 5,385 employees, up 28% year-over-year as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high-quality talent to further bolster our future growth.\nAdditionally, I want to congratulate the 2021 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Coby Bryant from the University of Cincinnati. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be in Oklahoma.\nTo sum up, we are executing well on all fronts with innovative solutions, high employee usage and increasing revenue retention. Robust market demand and our proven go-to-market strategy are fueling strong new client revenue momentum. I'd like to thank our employees for help making 2021 such a strong year, and we are set up to do even better in 2022 and we're off to a great start.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?\n\nCraig E. Boelte\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary, Paycom Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2021 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe ended the year with very strong results, delivering a milestone full year 2021 revenue total of $1,056,000,000, up 25.4% compared to 2020. Fourth quarter results were excellent with total revenues of $285 million representing growth of 29% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth is driven by strong demand, new business wins and adoption of recent new product offerings. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $280 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 29% from the comparable prior year period.\nWe ended 2021 with nearly 34,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 9% compared to 2020. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 17,700 clients, representing a growth rate of 10% compared to 2020. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $239.7 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.1%. For the full year 2021, our adjusted gross margin was 85.1%. For 2022, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%.\nAdjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $72.3 million or 25.4% of revenues. Our marketing strategy in 2021 has been very effective at driving high-quality demo leads, and our outside and inside sales teams have been doing a great job closing these leads. We plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2022.\nIn addition, as Chad said, we have added 4 more outside sales offices bringing the total outside sales office opening to 5 new openings in the last 5 months. We also continue to add inside sales personnel as we grow our sales organization to meet the demand.\nAdjusted R&D expense was $32.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 11.3% of total revenue. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $33.2 million in the prior year period. We aggressively recruited talent in R&D throughout the pandemic, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% of total revenues compared to $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues compared to $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues in 2020. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share versus $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares.\nFor the full year 2021, our GAAP net income was $196 million or $3.37 per diluted share. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 30.4%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year period. For the full year 2021, our non-GAAP net income was $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share versus $203.5 million or $3.49 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with Q1 GAAP effective tax rate expected to be approximately 30%.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $278 million and total debt of $29 million. Cash from operations was $319 million in 2021, representing an increase of 40.6%, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDuring 2021, we repurchased approximately 164,000 shares for a total of roughly $65.6 million. Through December 31, 2021, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $488 million, and we currently have $266 million remaining in our buyback program.\nNow let me turn to guidance. For\n(technical difficulty)\n2022, we expect revenue in the range of $1,314,000,000 to $1,316,000,000 or nearly 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $524 million to $526 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 40% at the midpoint of the range. We are starting this year's guidance at the Rule of 65.\nFor the first quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $342 million to $344 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $161 million to $163 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47% at the midpoint of the range.\n2021 was a very strong year for Paycom as a direct result of the investments we made. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to meet the strong demand we are experiencing and to support our high expectations for long-term future growth.\nWith that, we will open the line for questions.

Schlosberg\n\nVice Chairman, President, CFO, COO, Secretary, Controller and Director, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report yet another quarter of strong financial results and cash generation with record quarterly net sales, gross profit dollars, operating income and net income. The percentage growth rates in reported gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share all outpaced our growth rate in net sales. .\nOverall, the global energy drink category remains healthy with robust growth. We believe household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category, driven by functionality and lifestyle positioning diverse offerings that appeal to an increasingly broad and loyal consumer base and affordable value offerings in addition to premium offerings. In the United States, according to Nielsen, for the recently reported 13-week period through October 25, 2025, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, increased by 12.2% versus the same period a year ago.\nIn EMEA, the energy big category, according to Nielsen, for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13-week period, which differ from country to country, grew at approximately 13.3% versus the same period last year, ForEx neutral. In APAC, the energy drink category according to Nielsen, [indiscernible] tech channels for the recently reported 13-week period, which differ from country to country, grew approximately 20.0% versus the same period last year, FX neutral.\nIn LATAM, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for our tracked markets for the 3 months ended September 30, 2025, and grew approximately 12.6% versus the same period last year, FX metro.\nOur net sales to customers outside the United States rose to approximately 43% of total reported net sales in the 2025 3rd quarter, the highest percentage recorded by the company for a single quarter. We believe our portfolio of energy drink offerings are well positioned to participate in the growing global image drink category, appealing to a broad range of consumers across geographies, price points and need states. Innovation continues to be an important contributor to category growth and we maintain a robust innovation pipeline.\nTurning to marketing. Our marketing messaging continues to resonate globally as we built strong momentum through the summer with marketing efforts focused on growing the core business and attracting new consumers. Highlights in the third quarter included the continued success of the Monster-sponsored McLaren Formula 1 team, Monster Energy [indiscernible] Sugar product was well received in EMEA and has recently been introduced in Texas, California and the Las Vegas Metropolitan area as an LTO, limited time offering with a nationwide launch planned in 2026.\nThe Summer X Games in Salt Lake City provided significant brand exposure as Monster Energy was once again the primary sponsor. Other major sponsorships and events during the quarter included the [ GFC ], the Motocross finals in Las Vegas, the Monster Energy Mode GP of Cataluna in Spain and Outside Land Music Festival in San Francisco among others. The Ultra-brand family continued its strong performance with the introduction of a digital media campaign centered around 0 sugar flavors unleashed complementing the viral social media surge, flagship white Ultra Zero together with robust merchandising activity at retail.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the impact of tariffs on our operating results is modest. In general, while our flavors and concentrates are manufactured both in the U.S. and Ireland at the present time, production of our finished products takes place locally in our respective markets. Despite the modest impact on our business in the third quarter, the tariff landscape continues to be complicated and dynamic.\nFor instance, tariffs significantly impacted the Midwest premium for aluminum which increased the cost of our aluminum cans. We also import some raw materials into the United States, export certain raw materials for local markets and export limited quantities of finished products. We do not believe, based on our business model that the current tariffs will have a material impact on the company's operating results. However, we expect it will continue to have a modest impact in the fourth quarter of 2025 and in 2026.\nWe will continue to recognize tariffs on aluminum through the higher mid-risk premium and continue to implement mitigation strategies across the business where possible.\nNow turning to our Q3 results. Net sales were $2.2 billion for the 2025 3rd quarter was 16.8% higher than net sales of $1.88 billion in the 2024 3rd quarter.

Excluding the alcohol brand segment from our reported results is purely illustrative as it remains part of our ongoing operations. Net sales for the company's Monster Energy Drinks segment increased 17.7% and to $2.03 billion for the 2025 3rd quarter from $1.72 billion for the 2024 3rd quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Monster Energy Drinks segment increased 16% in the 2025 3rd quarter.\nNet sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment increased 15.9% to $130.5 million for the 2025 3rd quarter from $112.6 million in the 2024 3rd quarter.

The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2025 3rd quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions supply chain optimization and product sales mix, partially offset by higher promotional analysis, increased aluminum can costs and geographical sales mix.\nDistribution expenses for the 2025 3rd quarter were $82.6 million or 3.8% of net sales compared with $82.7 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2024 3rd quarter.

Stock-based compensation was $32.8 million for the 2025 3rd quarter compared with $27.5 million in the 2024 third quarter. The increase in stock-based compensation for the 2025 3rd quarter included $7.4 million related to certain equity awards granted late in the 2025 3rd quarter that contained a new retirement clause.\nOperating expenses for the 2025 3rd quarter were $549.1 million compared with $59.9 million in the 2024 3rd quarter. Adjusted operating expenses for the 2025 3rd quarter were $510.4 million compared with $474.7 million in the 2024 3rd quarter.

The effective tax rate for the 2025 3rd quarter was 23.9% compared with 21.8% in the 2024 3rd quarter. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher income taxes from foreign tax jurisdictions.\nNet income per diluted share for the 2025 3rd quarter increased 41.1% to $0.53 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted net income per diluted share for the 2025 3rd quarter increased 36.2% to $0.50 seconds from $0.41 in the third quarter of 2024.\nAnd now let's turn to North America. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada in the 2025 3rd quarter increased by 11.6% in dollars over the same period in 2024. The quarter was driven by strong execution across channels, sustained momentum from prior innovations, continued strength of the Monster Energy Ultra family and a strong contribution from the Juice Monster family. In the U.S., according to Nielsen, for the 13 weeks ended September 27, 2025.\nMonster Energy Ultra brand family grew 29% year-over-year led by our flagship White 0 Ultra and strong repeat purchases of early innovations, including Ultra Blue Avian and Ultra Visquada. Our revenue growth management team remains focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, value creation and strategic trade spend optimization. We implemented pricing adjustments through frontline price increases and/or reductions in promotional allowances by package and channel in the U.S. effective November 1, 2025.\nOur pricing strategy considers consumer purchasing behavior, brand momentum, channel and package mix. We continue to anticipate minimal impact on volumes, supported by the category's favorable value proposition and the relatively modest pace of energy drink price increases compared to other NRT beverages over the past decade. Currently, we are in the process of launching a number of SKUs at retail to take us through 2025. These are Monster Energy Ultra Light Passion [indiscernible] Bad Apple, Monster Electric Blue, Monster [indiscernible] and in certain markets, Monster Energy [indiscernible].\nOur innovation is supported by upgraded analytics for SKU flow, display optimization and cooler resets.

In addition, we have a robust innovation slate planned for 2026. In January, we are planning to launch Monster Energy [indiscernible] in full and 0 sugar offerings.\nIn February, we are planning to launch Juice Monster [indiscernible] pop drop. We are planning to introduce Monster Energy [indiscernible] sugar on a nationwide basis. Later in the first quarter, we are planning to launch FLRT select channels. FLRT is a female-focused brand with 4 initial flavors [indiscernible] Berry tempting and Sunset squeeze and contains 0 sugar and include ingredients we believe, will appeal to our target audience.\nWe're also planning to launch Monster Energy Ultra punch in March. In April, we are planning to launch Full Throttle Red Apple and [indiscernible]. Additionally, we are planning to launch Storm Energy in the second quarter 2026 in the wellness Zero Sugar energy drink segment. We're also planning to introduce 2 LTOs, it's limited time offers from May to July 2026, Monster Energy Ultra Red, White and Blue Rays dRas and [indiscernible] to coincide with America's 25th anniversary.\nTurning to sales internationally. Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 23.3% to $937.1 million or a record of approximately 43% of total net sales in the 2025 3rd quarter compared to $760.1 million or approximately 40% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2024. It Net sales to customers outside the United States on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 19.1% and to $905.3 million in the 2025 3rd quarter.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in all 3 of our international regions EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America in the 2025 3rd quarter as compared to the 2024 3rd quarter.\nNow focusing on M&A.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2025 3rd quarter was 37.0% versus 35.4% in the same period in 2024. The quarter was driven by strong execution across markets, including accelerated cooler placements and space games. Sales growth reflects contributions from both existing SKUs and 2025 innovation with growth from all brand families, especially the Monster Energy Ultra and Juice Monster families.\nEnergy Drink category growth remains healthy with Monster are performing the category in the majority of the EMEA markets. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Coca-Cola Euro-Pacific Partners Western European markets the Monster Energy brand was the fastest-growing FMCG brand by value and value growth year-to-date. According to Nielsen, for the most recent 30-week period, the Monster brand is now the #1 energy drink in Greece, adding to our market leadership in a number of other countries.\nOur affordable brands continue to grow and gain share in their respective markets. Within EMEA, we are seeing continued strong growth of Predator Fury in Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria and are continuing the rollout of Predator in Morocco. We are the market leader in Kenya. Innovation continues to drive performance in this region, in particular, Monster Energy [indiscernible] sugar, which is now available in 27 EMEA markets, became the company's most successful new product launch in the EMEA.\nIn the third quarter, we launched Monster Energy Valentino Rossi Zero Sugar in 12 markets and Monster Ultra [indiscernible] in Australia, with both products sham-promising initial results.

We launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams and [indiscernible] in the quarter and both contributed to growth and market share gains. As you may be aware, Mexico recently approved new excise taxes on sugar and artificially sweetened drinks effective January 2026, which will apply to to drinks in our portfolio.\nWhile Mexico accounts for a low single-digit percentage of our sales, we will work to reduce the impact on our business where possible. Net sales in Chile in the 2025 3rd quarter increased 6% in dollars and 8.1% on a currency-neutral basis. Net sales in Argentina in 2025 3rd quarter decreased 15.1% in dollars and 15.0% on a currency-neutral basis. The net sales decrease in Argentina was due to lower price per case revenues as a result of a change in our operating model late in the first quarter of 2025 with the objective of better managing our foreign currency exposure. Our volumes in Argentina actually increased in the quarter.\nTurning to Monster Brewing. Net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $33 million in the 2025 3rd quarter, a decrease of approximately $6.8 million or 17% lower than the 2024 comparable quarter. Our recently launched hard lemonade lines, Lime Lemon and Blind Lemon began shipping nationally in July, our first subline of the beast, a spirit-based RTD, ready-to-drink and 2 new beer brands among the planned innovations in 2026.\nDuring the 2025 3rd quarter, no shares of the company's common stock were repurchased against our repurchase program. As of November 5, 2025, approximately $500 million remain available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program.\nTurning now to October 2025 sales. We estimate that October 2025 sales on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis, were approximately 14.1% higher than the comparable October 2024 sales and 14.5% higher on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2025 sales were approximately 13% higher than the comparable October 2024 sales and 13.4% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the alcohol brand segment. October 2025 had the same number of selling days as October 2024.\nIn this regard, we caution again that sales of the short period, often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in holidays fall timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some cases, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such partners.\nFurthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to the only internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Our record quarterly net sales, gross profit dollars, operating income and net income speak to the strength of our brands. In addition, the percentage growth rates in reported gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share all outpaced our growth rates in net sales. The energy drink category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category, growth opportunities in household penetration for capital consumption, along with consumers' needs for energy are positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen-tracked channels.\nGlobally, as measured by Scanner Data, consumer demand remained strong in the energy drink category. We continue to review opportunities for price increases both domestically and internationally. We continue to invest in our supply chain to better service our customers and improve our cost structure. We are excited about our innovation pipeline for 2026 and beyond.\nFinally, we are hosting an Investor Day in New York City on [indiscernible], and we hope you can join us in person or online. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

In fact, our second quarter net sales of $2.11 billion are a quarterly record that crossed the $2 billion threshold for the first time in the company's history, with net sales increasing 11.1% compared with the 2024 2nd quarter. In addition, the percentage growth rates in reported gross profit, operating income net income and earnings per share all outpaced our growth rate in net sales.\nOverall, the global energy drink category remains healthy with accelerating growth.

Net sales in the U.S. and Canada in the 2025 second quarter increased by 8.6% in dollars over the same period in 2024. Growth for the quarter was led by the Monster Energy Ultra family.\nIn the United States, according to the Nielsen reports for the 30 weeks ended July 19, 2025, the Monster Energy Ultra Family was the third largest stand-alone energy drink brand in dollar sales in the energy drink category after Red Bull and Monster for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, including energy starts.\nInnovation continues to drive performance with Monster Energy Ultra Blue Hawaiian and Monster Energy Ultra Vice Guava contributing to the Monster Energy Ultra brand family growth. Our 2 [ Monster Killer Brew SKUs ] and Juiced Ones of [ Viking Berry ] also contributed to U.S. growth.\nOur revenue growth management team remains focused on long-term value creation opportunities and trade spend optimization. The pricing of energy drinks in the United States has increased at a slower rate than other NARTD beverages in the last decade, and we believe this provides for a favorable value proposition with consumers.\nTo that end, we have initiated discussions with our bottlers and customers and are planning for selective price adjustments by packaging channel as well as reductions in promotional allowances in the United States effective during the 2025 fourth quarter. As communicated at our annual meeting, we're planning to launch 2 new full sugar Monster Energy flavors, Monster Energy Electric Blue and Monster Energy [ Orange Dream Sickle ] in the fall. We are also planning to introduce [ Juice Monster Bad Apple], which was introduced in select EMEA markets in 2 as well as Monster Energy Ultra will passion in the fall. Additionally, we are planning a strategic launch Monster Energy [indiscernible] Sugar in Texas and Nevada in California leveraging the Formula 1 races in the United States later this year.\nTurning to sales internationally. Net sales to customers outside the United States on a foreign currency adjusted basis, increased 16.5% to $869.3 million in the 2025 second quarter. Reported net sales to customers outside the United States were $864.2 million, 41% of total net sales in the 2025 second quarter compared to $746 million or 39% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2024. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars of approximately $5 million in the 2025 second quarter.\nTurning to EMEA. Our net sales in EMEA in the 2025 second quarter increased by 26.8% in dollars and increased 23.7% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2024. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2025 second quarter was 36.1% versus 34.7% in the same period in 2024.\nEnergy drink category growth remains healthy with Monster outperforming the category in many EMEA markets. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Western Europe, excluding Iceland, the Monster Energy brand is now the seventh largest FMCG brand by value. According to Nielsen, for the most recent 13-week period, the Monster brand is now the #1 energy drink in Norway. Our affordable brands continue to grow, gain share in their respective markets.\nWithin EMEA, we are also seeing growth of Fury in Egypt and Predator in Kenya and Nigeria. Innovation continues to drive performance in the region with Juice Monster Rio Punch and Monster Energy Ultra strollers, contributing to the growth in the quarter. In addition, we launched Monster Energy [ Landers ] Zero Sugar in 5 markets at the end of the second quarter. We will continue to roll out throughout the second half of 2025 in 33 additional markets in EMEA.\nWe're especially excited about the launch of this product due to its unique package design a pending million-user flavor and strong activation by our sales teams and our Coca-Cola bottling partners. We will be launching various Monster Energy strategic brands and affordable brand products in additional markets in EMEA throughout the rest of 2025, including the rollout of Monster Energy [ Valentino Rossi Zero ] Sugar in a number of countries.\nTurning to Asia Pacific. Net sales in Asia Pacific in the 2025 second quarter increased 11.6%, both in dollars and on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2024. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2025 second quarter was 41.0% versus 45.4% in the same period in 2024.\nThe decrease in gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher promotional allowances and geographic sales mix. Net sales in Japan in the 2025 second quarter increased 6.1% in dollars and increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis. We are planning to launch 2 SKUs of rainstorm in Japan in the 2025 third quarter.\nNet sales in South Korea in the 2025 second quarter increased 22.4% in dollars and increased 28.9% on a currency-neutral basis as compared to the same quarter in 2024.

During the second quarter, sales growth of the Monster Energy brand remained solid, [ repetitor ] growing meaningfully ahead of the energy drink category in part reflecting its ongoing rollout into new markets and increased production capacity with the Coca-Cola bottlers in India.\nOverall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our brands in Asia Pacific and are excited about the incremental expansion of our affordable brands in China and India. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 8.3% in dollars and increased 11.9% on a currency-neutral basis.\nTurning to Latin America and the Caribbean. Net sales in Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, in the 2025 second quarter decreased 7.8% in dollars and increased 1.7% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2024.\nSlower growth in the region on a currency-neutral basis was primarily attributable to a change to the operating model in Argentina, lower net sales in certain countries primarily due to production challenges and adverse weather in the region, particularly in Brazil.\nGross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 45.2% for the 2025 second quarter versus 45.8% in the 2024 second quarter. Net sales in Brazil in the second quarter decreased 1.3% in dollars but increased 10.4% on a currency-neutral basis. We are planning to launch Juice Monster [ Rio punch ] in the 2025 third quarter.\nNet sales in Chile in the 2025 second quarter increased 4.6% in dollars and 4.2% on a currency-neutral basis. We are planning to launch Juice Monster Pipeline Punch in the 2025 third quarter. Net sales in Argentina in the 2025 second quarter decreased 33.9% in dollars and 30.2% on a currency-neutral basis. The net sales decrease in Argentina was partially due to lower per case revenues as a result of a change to operating model late in the first quarter of 2025 with the objective to better manage our foreign currency exposure.\nNet sales in Mexico decreased 7.0% in dollars and increased 10.8% on a currency-neutral basis in the 2025 second quarter. In the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster Energy [ Ultra Strawberry Dreams ] and Predator [ Wild Berry].\nTurning to Monster Brewing. Monster Brewing results improved relative to the first quarter of 2025 but continue to face challenges in the second quarter. During the 2025 second quarter, we reduced head count as part of our cost reduction plans.\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $38 million in the 2025 second quarter, a decrease of approximately $3.6 million or 8.6% lower than the 2024 comparable quarter. We continue to plan for the launch of the beast in certain international markets, subject to regulatory approvals.\nWe are also planning further innovation in Monster Brewing in the coming months for example, a new hard lemonade lines, [ line lemon and blind lemon ] began shipping nationally in July. During the 2025 second quarter, no shares of the company's common stock were repurchased as of August 6, 2025, approximately $500 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program.\nNow turning to our July 2025 sales. We estimate that July 2025 sales on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis, were approximately 24.3% higher than the comparable July 2024 sales and 24.9% higher on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment.\nWe estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2025 sales were approximately 22.2% higher than the comparable July 2024 sales and 22.8% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. July 2025 had the same number of selling days as July 2024.\nIn this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period, often is proportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production.\nIn some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the date on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons.\nWe iterate that sales over a short period such as a single [indiscernible] should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our record quarterly net sales crossed the $2 billion threshold for the first time in the company's history. In addition, [indiscernible] growth rates in reported gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share all outpaced our growth rate in net sales.\nThe energy drink category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers' needs for energy of positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen-tracked channels.\nGlobally, as measured by scanner data, consumer demand remained strong. In the United States, the energy drink category, as measured by Nielsen, accelerated in the 2025 second quarter compared to the 2025 first quarter with growth remaining strong in July. Monster sales at retail have followed a similar some trend. We continue to review opportunities for price increases domestically and internationally. We are excited for our innovation pipeline for 2025 and beyond. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

[Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Co-CEOs, Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Please go ahead.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and my Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly\n\nSenior Vice President-Finance\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

I would also like to note that an explanation of the non-GAAP measures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2025. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Tom. We continue to see sustained growth in the global energy drink category. In the United States, we are seeing a resurgence of growth in the energy drink category in the nice in convenience as well as in all measured channels reported by Nielsen. Our non-Nielsen channels continue to grow as well. Growth opportunities in household penetration and per capita consumption along with consumers' growing need for energy are positive trends for the category. Hurricanes Helen and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in October 2024. However, we have not determined the impact on our business. The alcohol segment operates a brewery in Brevard, North Carolina, which was closed for a week due to flooding from Hurricane Helene. This brewery was partially operational for a period and was fully operational by mid-November 2024.\nIn the United States, the energy category, according to Nielsen, for the recently reported 13 weeks through February 15, 2025, grew at 6.2% versus the same period last year. In EMEA, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13-week period, which differ from country to country, grew at approximately 14.4% versus the same period last year. In APAC, the energy drink category according to Nielsen and in Taj for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13-week period, which differ from country to country, grew at approximately 11.8% versus the same period last year. And in Lat Am, the energy drink category according to Nielsen, for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13-week period, which differ from country to country, grew at approximately 20.2% versus the same period last year. In each case, these are done on an FX-neutral basis.\nCertain items should be separately considered in evaluating the results for the quarter. These specific items are as follows: gross profit for the 2024 fourth quarter was adversely impacted by an increase in inventory reserves due to excess inventory levels in the alcohol brands segment of $4.1 million and which I will now refer to as the alcohol brands inventory reserves. Operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter were adversely impacted by $130.7 million of impairment charges related to the alcohol brands segment. The impairment charges were primarily the result of operating and financial performance, not meeting projections due in part to challenges in the category as well as a decrease in projected ongoing operating and financial performance.\nIn addition, operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter were adversely impacted by $1.8 million of company incurred legal expenses in connection with an intellectual property claim brought by the descendants of Hubert Hansen in relation to the company's use of the Hubert Hansen name prior to the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, which closed in 2015 and which we will now refer to as the Hansen litigation. Operating income adjusting for these items rose 7.9% to $517.9 million in the 2024 fourth quarter. Net of tax, these items adversely impacted net income for the 2024 fourth quarter by $105 million and net income per diluted share by $0.10 per share. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 fourth quarter adjusted for these items was $0.38 per share.\nAs a reminder, the bank inventory step-up and impairment in the alcohol brand segment were previously disclosed as items impacting profitability for the comparative 2023 fourth quarter. In addition to our condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our gold consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, Attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for the items impacting profitability and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP items are useful to shareholders on this call in evaluating our ongoing operating and financial results. These non-GAAP items should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of U.S. GAAP financial measures. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of 1.18 billion, in the 2024 fourth quarter. 1.81 billion, sorry, sorry, 4.7% higher than net sales of $1.73 billion in the comparable 2023 quarter, 4.8% excluding the alcohol segment. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter increased 7.8% or 7.9%, excluding the alcohol segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter was 55.3% compared with 54.2% in the 2023 fourth quarter.\nGross profit for the 2024 fourth quarter was adversely impacted by the alcohol brands inventory reserves, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter Exclusive of the alcohol brands inventory reserves was 55.5%. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter was primarily the result of reduced input costs partially offset by geographical sales mix. On a sequential quarterly basis, gross margins were higher than the 2024 third quarter gross margins.\nOperating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter was $621.2 million compared with $54.4 million in the 2023 fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased impairment charges within the alcohol brands segment, increased payroll expenses and increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter were 34.3% compared with 29.2% in the 20,234th quarter. Adjusted operating expenses after making the adjustments described earlier, increased 5.5% to $488.7 million as compared to\n$463.2 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter were 27% compared with 26.8% in the 2023 fourth quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter was $77.6 million or 4.3% of net sales compared to $79.6 million or 4.6% of net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter. Operating income in the 2024 fourth quarter decreased 12.2% and to $381.2 million from 434 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. Adjusted operating income after making the adjustments described earlier increased 7.9% to $517.9 million as compared to $480.1 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 fourth quarter was 29.9% compared with 18.5% in the 2023 fourth quarter.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the 2024 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction for the 2024 fourth quarter and adjustment to the 2024 full year effective tax rate higher 2024 state income taxes and the establishment of a state valuation allowance relating to certain net operating losses of the alcohol Brands segment. Net income for the 2024 fourth quarter was $270.7 million as compared to $367 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Adjusted net income in the 2024 fourth quarter after making the adjustments described earlier, were $375.7 million as compared to adjusted net income of $402.4 million in the 2023 comparable quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share for the 2024 fourth quarter decreased 20.8% to $0.28 from $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share after making the adjustments described earlier, remained consistent at $0.38 per share for both the 2024 and 2023 fourth quarters. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 8.4% for the 2020 full year. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $1.62 per share for the 2024 full year compared with adjusted net income per share of $1.56 per share for the 2023 full year. Our fourth quarter financial results were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets, Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter of $52.3 million.\nAs previously reported, we implemented a 5% increase on our brands and packages, excluding bank, rain and rainstorm effective November 1, 2024 in the United States. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions, both domestically and internationally. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks ended February 15, 2025, for all outlets combined, excluding convenience and gas, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9% versus the same period a year ago. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks ended February 15, 2025, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.2% versus the same period a year ago.\nSales of the company's energy drink brands including Bank were up 4.4% in the 13-week period.

NOS share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7 of a point. bank's share was 1.8%.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 15, 2025, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which included our two Monster line in the convenience and gas channel decreased 9.1% over the same period the previous year.

Sales of Predator increased 27.9% and its market share increased 0.8 of a share point to 6.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 13.4% for the month of December 2024. Monster sales increased 15.7% and Monster's market share in value increased 0.9% to 47.7% compared to December 2023.\nIn Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation, related to local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 98.7% for the month of January 2025. Monster sales increased 82.5%. And Monster's market share in value decreased 4.5 points to 51.2% compared to January 2024. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 16.2% for the month of January 2025. Monster's sales increased 13%. Monster's market share in value decreased 1.1 points to 39.5%. Monster Energy remains a leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.

Production in Brevard normalized in November, while other facilities we utilized during the quarter to allow for a minimal overall disruption. In addition to the appointment of a new President of Monster Brewing announced last quarter, we have now restructured the senior management team in sales, marketing, strategy and operations divisions and will be implementing further adjustments in the coming months with the intent to optimize our personnel and facilities to support the current demands of our portfolio and innovation pipeline.\nWe are currently shipping Beast, Pink Poison and Killer Sunrise in 24-ounce cans and we'll be launching Nalu Grape in 24-ounce cans in the coming months. Michi, our newest flavored beer innovation will also be launched nationally in the coming months in two 24-ounce flavors, [ Chelada and Michelada ]. We are planning to launch the Beast internationally the summer in select markets, subject to regulatory approvals. We are planning for further innovation in Monster brewing in the coming months. In October 2024, we launched Monster Ultra was Wave nationally. The initial response from both customers and consumers alike has been very positive on this innovation.\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of 2025, we launched innovation across various brands, including Monster Energy Ultra Blue Hawaiian Monster Energy grew Triple Shot, Killer Brew Triple Shot, Monster Energy juice Viking Berry, Rainstorm Tropical, Rain White Haze and Bang Energy Sour Ropes. We are planning to launch Bang Energy any means Orange next month, which is part of our relationship with the popular content and streaming group any means possible.

In February 2025, we launched Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams in South Korea. In March, we are planning to introduce Monster Energy in a 250 ml can that contains our regular energy ingredients minus cafe specifically for the on-premise channel in Japan. Additionally, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India and are excited about the incremental expansion of the Predator brand in these two countries after positive results in several provinces in China in 2024 and we will proceed with the national rollout of noncarbonated predator in 500 PET bottles starting next month.\nAs of February 27, 2025, approximately $500 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, January 2025 sales were approximately 5.3% higher than the comparable January 2024 sales and 6.7% higher than January 2024, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate that January 2025 sales on a non foreign currency adjusted basis were approximately 1.5% higher than the comparable January 2024 sales and 2.8% higher than in January 2024, excluding the alcohol brands segment. January 25 had the same number of selling days as January 2024.\nWe believe January 2025 sales were adversely impacted by the California wildfires, and by other severe weather conditions in the United States, such as the Gulf Coast Blizzard affecting New Orleans in Florida as well as the northeastern ice storms. Our distribution partners warehouses and retail outlets were closed for certain time periods in these areas during January. However, we cannot or have not determined the impact on our business at this time. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production.\nIn some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules, this affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally.\nWe believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen measured channels. As reported earlier, we implemented a price increase in the United States on November 1, 2024, and we continue to review opportunities for price increases domestically and internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region.\nThe juice plant at our AFF facility in Ireland has now been completed after trials. We expect the juice plant to be in production by midyear. We're excited for our 2025 innovation pipeline globally we are currently exploring opportunities for our alcohol products in certain international jurisdictions. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of marks internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. With respect to the California wildfires, just as with Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene, our team has been providing support, water, energy drinks, clothing and other items to the first responders and to local communities impacted by these events.\nI would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the full year. Thank you."

The energy drink category in the United States and in certain other countries experienced lower growth rates in the second quarter. Retailers have reported a reduction in convenience store foot traffic and we have seen a shift in retail towards more mass and dollar channels. Other beverage and consumer packaged product companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment and weaker demand in the quarter. The energy category globally continues to grow and has demonstrated resilience as we believe that consumers view energy drinks as an affordable luxury.\nWe believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen measured channels.

On a sequential quarterly basis, gross margins were 0.5% below 2024 first quarter margins, primarily as a result of higher allowances certain of which we believe are nonrecurring as well as production inefficiencies. Operating expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $492.3 million, compared with $450.4 million in the 2023 second quarter.\nThe increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses, increased payroll expenses and increased storage and warehouse expenses.

Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $87.4 million or 4.6% of net sales compared to $82 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2023 second quarter.

The company accepted for purchase approximately 56.6 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $53 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3 billion excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. In addition, during the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, the company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares over common stock at an average purchase price of $49.55 per share for a total consideration of approximately $107.7 million, excluding broker commissions. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the company repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $49.59 per share for total consideration of approximately $192.2 million, excluding broker commissions.\nAs of August 6, 2024, approximately 342.4 million shares remained available for purchase -- sorry, $342 million remained available for purchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that July 2024 sales were approximately 5.9% higher than the comparable July 2023 sales and 6.1% higher than July 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment July 2024 sales were approximately 9.4% higher than the comparable July sales and 9.6% higher than July 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment.\nJuly 2024 had 2 more selling days compared to July 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. As reported earlier, we are planning a price increase in the United States on our core brands and packages effective November 1, 2024.\nWe continue to review opportunities for price increases internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland, which we anticipate will be completed later this year. We're excited for the launch of Monster Energy Ultra Vice Guava in October 2024. Monster Brewing continues to provide opportunities within the alcohol brand segment. We're excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand fits well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands.\nWe are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands.\nI would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter."

The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 first quarter, 11.8% higher than net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 comparable period and 15.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, 12.6% exclusive of Argentina's impact. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter was 54.1% compared with 52.8% in the comparative 2023 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower import costs, partially offset by geographical sales mix.\nOperating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $485.1 million compared with $412.8 million in the 2023 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were 25.5% compared with 24.3% in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased storage and warehouse, increased marketing expenses, including sponsorship and endorsement and social media expenses as well as increased payroll expenses. Distribution expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $94.4 million or 5% of net sales compared to $76.3 million or 4.5% of net sales in the 2023 first quarter.\nOperating income for the 2024 first quarter increased 11.7% to $542 million from $485.1 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 first quarter was 23.5% compared with 20.1% in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction in the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter.\nNet income increased 11.2% to $442 million as compared to $397.4 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 first quarter increased 12% to $0.42 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2023. The company implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets, including highly inflationary markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally.

Monster's market share in value decreased 0.7 point to 29.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 28.6% and its market share increased 0.2 share points to 5.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 15.7% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 26.7%. Monster's market share in value increased 4.2 points to 48.1% compared to March 2023. In Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation-related local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 265.9% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 300.2%. The Monster's market share in value increased 5 points to 58.5% compared to March 2023.\nIn Chile, the energy drink category decreased 8.4% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales decreased 7.8%. Monster's market share in value increased 0.3 points to 42.9%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

During the 2024 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.96 per share for a total amount of $97.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. The company intends to commence a modified Dutch auction tender offer for up to $3 billion in value of shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions at a specified price range that is yet to be determined. The company believes that the tender offer represents an efficient mechanism to permit shareholders the opportunity to obtain liquidity without the potential disruption that can result from market sales. The company expects to fund the tender offer with approximately $2 billion of cash on hand and approximately $1 billion in combined borrowings, consisting of a new revolving credit facility and a new delayed draw term loan facility. Each expected to be consummated prior to the completion of the tender offer. The tender offer will be made outside of the company's previously authorized repurchase programs and will allow the company to retain the ability to purchase additional shares through the previously authorized repurchase programs in the future. The company's co-CEOs, namely Hilton and myself, have indicated that we intend to participate in the offer for investment diversification and estate planning purposes. My participation in particular, may provide me some flexibility to consider my own potential options, which may also help the company continue succession planning for its next phase of leadership. In this regard, after consultation with the company's Board, I am considering reducing my day-to-day management responsibilities starting in 2025, while continuing to manage certain areas of the company's business for which I have always been responsible. At that time, I intend to remain Chairman of the company's Board and Mr. Slosberg would segue from Co-CEO to CEO.\nWe estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 12.9% higher than the comparable April 2023 sales and 14.9% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment. Excluding Argentina's impact, we estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 11.5% higher than the comparable April sales and 13.5% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate April 2024 sales, including the alcohol brands segment to be approximately 10% higher than in April 2023 and 11.9% higher than in April 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. April 2024, we had 2 more selling days compared to April 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a larger number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations.

Kelly\n\nSenior Vice President-Finance\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.\nManagement cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.\nPlease refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2023, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.\nThe company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBefore I turn the call over to Rodney Sacks, I would like to mention a clerical error that we had with the filing of our most recent press release that was filed just within the last half hour. And under the -- in the income statement section, under the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, the amount that was reported as gross profit which was reported as $983,372,000, should have been $938,372,000. Aside from that clerical error, all other numbers on the press release are correct.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter was 54.2% compared to 51.8% in the comparative 2022 fourth quarter.\nAs a result of the Bang inventory step-up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $5 million during the 2023 fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.5% for the 2023 fourth quarter, excluding the Bang inventory step-up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter as compared to the 2022 fourth quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs.\nDuring this call, we will talk about impairment charges of approximately $39.9 million recorded in the 2023 fourth quarter related to the Alcohol Brands segment due in part to the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories. We will refer to these charges as the alcohol impairment charges. The alcohol impairment charges related to certain non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment acquired as part of the CANarchy transaction.\nOperating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $504.4 million compared to $390 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter included the alcohol impairment charges. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 29.2% compared with 25.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter. Exclusive of the alcohol impairment charges as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 26.8%. Distribution expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $79.6 million or 4.6% of net sales, compared to $76.1 million or 5% of net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter.\nOperating income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10% to $434 million, from $394.4 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. Operational income adjusted for the Bang inventory step-up and the alcohol impairment charges increased 21.4% to $478.9 million for the 2023 fourth quarter.\nThe effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was 18.5%, compared with 23.3% in the 2022 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in the stock compensation deduction.\nNet income increased 21.6% to $367 million, as compared to $301.7 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Net income adjusted for the Bang inventory step-up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, increased 33.1% to $401.5 million for the 2023 fourth quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 22.3% to $0.35, from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang inventory step-up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, was $0.38 for the 2023 fourth quarter, an increase of 33.8%.\nThe company has implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and 4-week periods ended February 17, 2024.\nAccording to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 5.5% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Predator increased 23.2%, and its market share increased 0.6 of a share point to 5.6%.\nThe Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen, for all outlets combined. In Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.9% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 33.6%. Monster's market share in value increased 4.7 points to 45.8% compared to January 2023.\nIn Argentina, due in part to hyperinflation, the energy drink category increased 167.2% for the month of January 2024.

Monster's market share in value increased 2.2 points to 55.8% compared to January 2023.\nIn Chile, the energy drink category increased 1.8% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales decreased 2.2%. Monster's market share in value decreased 1.7 points to 40.5%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January 2024, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period of the previous year, grew from 14.9% to 16.3% in Belgium; from 31% to 31.6% in France; from 30.8% to 33.2% in Great Britain; from 4.9% to 6.2% in the Netherlands; from 32.7% to 34.4% in Norway; and from 40.5% to 40.9% in Spain.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended until the end of December 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 20.1% to 22.4% in the Czech Republic; from 13.7% to 17.1% in Germany; from 30.2% to 31.1% in Italy; and from 27.6% to 30.1% in the Republic of Ireland.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 30-week period until the end of December 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, remained flat at 18.6% in Poland.

So that is dollars.\nWe estimate on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, January 2024 sales were approximately 20.5% higher than the comparable period January 2023 sales, and 19.7% higher than January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. We estimate January 2024 sales, including the Alcohol Brand segment to be approximately 17.8% higher than in January 2023, and 17% higher than in January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment.\nJanuary 2024 had one more selling day compared to January 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers.\nFurthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be in future to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally. Two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland.\nWe have a robust innovation plan for 2024. The Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We're excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands.\nAnd lastly, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis.\nI would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the 2023 year. Thank you."

Hilton Schlosberg; our Vice -- my Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly\n\nSenior Vice President-Finance\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Act of Banki34 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

On July 31, 2023, the company completed its acquisition of Bang Energy, which is the bank transaction. The acquired assets primarily include Bang energy drinks and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang transaction was recorded at fair value. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value, which we define as the bank inventory step-up hereafter in the call.\nAs a result of the Bang inventory step up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter. During the 2023 third quarter in connection with the bank transaction, the company recorded a gain of $45.4 million, which will be referred to hearing after as the Bang transaction gain. In interest and other income and expense net within the condensed consolidated statement of income.\nDuring the 2023 third quarter, the company incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition expenses related to the Bang transaction, and those are referred to also later in this call as the Bang transaction expenses. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.86 billion in the 2023 third quarter 14.3% higher than net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter was 53% compared with 51.3% in the comparative 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 53.4% for the 2023 third quarter, excluding the bank inventory step-up.\nThe increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter as compared to the 2022 third quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased rating costs and decreased aluminum can costs. Promotional allowances for the 2023 third quarter were higher than in the comparable 2022 third quarter as well as the 2023 second quarter.\nOperating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $473.2 million compared with $415.8 million in the 2022 third quarter.

Interest and other income expense net for the 2023 third quarter increased to $71.4 million from $2.1 million in the 2022 comparative quarter.

We are pleased with the initial results of the Beasts Unleashed and are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being available in substantially all of the United States by the end of 2023. We plan to launch Nasty Beast Heart T in the first quarter of 2024 with the goal of being national of national distribution in the first half of next year.\nNast Beast hard tea will be available in 4 flavors and will be sold in 24-hour single-serve cans as well as in a variety 12-pack of 12-ounce sleek cans.

We also transitioned the Monster brand in the Philippines from our independent distributor to our Coca-Cola Philippines bottler.\nDuring the 2023 3rd quarter, the company purchased approximately 7.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.83 per share for a total amount of $400 million excluding broker commissions. As of November 2, approximately $282.8 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program.

We estimate that October sales, including the alcohol brand segment to be approximately 24.8% higher than in October 2022 and 24% higher than in October 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. October 2023 had 1 more selling day compared to October 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production.\nIn some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions, which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are continuing with our plans to add a juice facility to our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We are pleased with our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Rainstorm in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 440 sugar in EMEA. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We are excited for the launch of Nasty Beast Hard Tea early next year with the goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024 as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the Cenac acquisition presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands.\nI'd like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J.

The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.85 billion in 2023 second quarter, 12.1% higher than net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 14.4% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter was 52.5% compared with 47.1% in the comparative 2022 second quarter. The increase in gross profit percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter as compared to the 2022 second quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freighting costs and increased aluminum can costs.\nThe increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in the alcohol segment and in which our sales had quite a nice bump as you've seen from the release. As expected, promotional allowances for the 2023 second quarter were marginally higher than the comparable 2022 second quarter as well as the 2023 first quarter.

The $5.8 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA.\nThe increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. We are purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have returned to our Orbitz strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in costs. The company continues to address certain challenges in its supply chain as it navigates the current global supply chain environment.\nOperating income for the 2023 second quarter eased 40.4% to $523.8 million from $373 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 second quarter was 23.2% compared with 25.3% in the 2022 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense a decrease in the effective state income tax rate as well as an increase in net income in certain foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates compared to the United States.\nNet income increased 51.4% to $413.9 million as compared to $273.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 second quarter increased 52.8% to $0.39 from $0.26 in the second quarter of 2022. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions the United States in 2022 as well as in many other international markets in 2022 and in the first half of 2023. The company plans to implement additional increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year.\nIn the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6-ounce and 24-ounce line -- effect of April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorney's fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang Energy products, VPX as a field the judgment. We also previously discussed the false advertising case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in which the jury returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages and the District Court granted MEC's motion for a permanent injunction in joining VPX and former CEO, Jack Oak from fastly or receptively claiming that Bang or any other beverages creatine or a form of creatine.\nVPX and Jack Oak appealed the injunction. The parties have completed briefing on remaining post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On June 28, 2023, VPX and certain affiliates entered into an asset purchase agreement with the company, which, among other things, provided for the company's acquisition of substantially all of VPX's assets. The transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement closed on July 31, 2023, at which time, the company was deemed to have allowed general unsecured claims VPX' bankruptcy case relating to the arbitration award and the juries award, subject to the potential modification of the [Curia] Award in the light of pending post-verdict motions filed by MEC and VPX. The asset purchase agreement also includes a mutual release between VPX and MEC, which, among other things, requires VPX to dismiss its appeals of the trade mark -- the false advertising case as well as cases that VPX filed against MEC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\nNote that this mutual release does not include any claims that come might have against Mr. -- in relation to that jury award. The company will not recognize the allowed general unsecured claims or the jury award as it relates to Mr. -- until they are realized or realizable. We will not be answering questions on these legal proceedings on today's call.\nIn June 2023, the company also entered into an agreement with Orange Bank, Inc. regarding the company's use and registration of certain bank trademarks and trade names subject to the successful closure of the asset purchase agreement. Under this agreement, the company will pay Orange Banking a onetime payment of approximately $12.5 million and a 2.5% royalty on all future sales products bearing the trade name Bank. On June 31, 2023, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nRodney that was July. July 31.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nSorry, sorry, I apologize. On July 31, 2023, we completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of vital pharmaceuticals in and certain of its affiliates collectively Bang Energy for a purchase price of approximately $362 million subject to adjustments. The acquired assets include Bang Energy beverages and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. We successfully recruited a limited number of former VPX employees to fill certain open positions within Monster as well as the majority of the team at the manufacturing site in Phoenix.\nPursuant to Monster's obligations with the Coca-Cola Company, Bang Energy will be distributed the Coca-Cola bottler network, starting with the United States in the 2023 third quarter. As a result, there will be a temporary disruption of the product supply of Bang Energy brand energy drinks. Additionally, our intention is to rationalize Bang's product offerings and product lines and to fully integrate Bang into the Monster infrastructure. We do not intend to manufacture or sell Bang's other product lines such as red line or shots beyond liquidating existing inventories at this time. We may consider reintroducing certain of those product lines sometime in the future.\nWe are excited about our acquisition of the state-of-the-art Bang energy production facility in Phoenix, Arizona, which we intend to utilize for Bang as well as other products in the Monster portfolio. As we only completed the acquisition this week, it is still early days, and we will provide you with further updates on Bang Energy on our next investor call in November.\nIn the first half of 2023, we launched the Beast Unleashed, which is now available in 28 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. According to Nielsen Scan data, the Beast Unleashed is currently one of the top new brands in the beer category in 2023. We plan to launch a hard iced tea extension of the Beast Unleashed named Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year with the goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024. The brand will have 4 flavors, original, half and half, Razel berry and green. Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea will be available in 24-ounce single-serve cans as well as in a variety 12-pack and 12-ounce sleek cans. We refreshed the Dales and Double Dale's beer brands in the first half of 2023 and introduced Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. The brand family has performed well since the refresh.\nThe high live brand family, the largest in our beer portfolio from scarcity is also performing well despite overall headwinds in the craft segment and is showing growth in retail scans. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust, and we look forward to sharing use of additional new products in future. In the 2023 second quarter in the United States, we focused on gaining distribution on our first quarter product innovation. Following the success of our recent Monster Zero Sugar launch, we are planning to launch NOS Zero Sugar in 16-ounce cans in the 2023 fourth quarter. In the 2023 second quarter, we expanded our Java Monster portfolio in Canada with the launch of Java Monster 300 triple shot Mocha and vanilla. We launched several new products in Latin America in second quarter.\nIn Argentina, we introduced our Monster Reserve brand with the launch of Reserve White pineapple in June. In the Caribbean, we continue to expand our portfolio and introduced a number of new products in different countries. After we successfully launched Java Monster Super coffee Mean Bean and Loca Mocha in Australia earlier this year, we expanded the launch of such products to the New Zealand market in the 2023 second quarter. We are pleased with the early results in both markets.\nIn EMEA, in the second quarter of 2023, we launched the Monster Reserve Watermelon, and White Pineapple, Ultra Gold, Ultra Fiesta Mango, Ultra Paradise, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Juiced -- Lemonade and Juiced Chaotic in a number of countries. During the 2023 second quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of BPM, Burn, Nalu, Predator and rain in certain countries. We launched the Monster Energy brand in Egypt in June 23 to add to Predator, which we launched earlier this year in Egypt.\nIn EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch, we expanded in of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar energy drink to an additional 8 EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 35 markets to date. During the second quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan and Monster Ultra Sunrise in Korea and Monster Reserve Pineapple in Turkey. We launched Predator in additional regions in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023.\nIn July 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Pitocin in Japan and Predator in Iraq, Monster Energy will be launched in the Philippines later this year. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, Including the alcohol brand segment, July 2023 sales were approximately 13.7% higher than the comparable July 2022 sales and 12% higher than July '22 excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate July 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment to be approximately 12.1% higher than in June -- than in July 2022 and 11.2% higher than in July 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. July 2023 had the same number of selling days as July 2022.\nIn this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers.\nFurthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. First, the energy category continues to grow globally. Second, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions, which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Third, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region.\nFourth, we are enthusiastic for our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Rainstorm and [indiscernible] in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar in EMEA. Fifth, we are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end the year. Sixth, we are excited by the launch of Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year with the goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024 as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the [indiscernible] presents.\nSeven, we are pleased with the initial results of our launch of rainstorm, our new line of total wellness energy drinks. Eight, we are pleased with the rollout of [indiscernible] affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number -- additional number of international markets. Not we are excited about the opportunities that the of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands.\nI would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

The company achieved record first quarter net sales of 1.7 billion in the 2023 first quarter, 11.9% higher than net sales of $1.52 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 15.3% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter was 52.8% compared with 51.1% in the comparative 2022 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter as compared to the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.8% in the 2023 first quarter from 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter and 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 53.6% in the 2023 first quarter from 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter and 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. The depletion of our remaining high-cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters, which should be fully utilized during 2023.\nOperating expenses for the 2023 first quarter were $412.8 million compared to $377.2 million in the 2022 first quarter.

The $5.1 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of $15.7 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of $9.9 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses.\nWe are now purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs.\nThe company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.\nOperating income for the 2023 first quarter increased 21.4% to $485.1 million from $399.5 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 first quarter was 20.1% compared with 25% in the 2022 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the increase in the stock compensation deduction in the 2023 first quarter. Net income increased 35.1% to $397.4 million as compared to $294.2 million in the 2022 comparable quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share for the 2023 first quarter increased 36.6% to $0.38 from $0.27 in the first quarter of 2022.\nDue to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022 as well as in many other international markets in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year.\nIn the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24-ounce lines effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nAccording to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2023 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 12.7% versus the same period a year ago.\nSales of the company's energy brands, including Reign, were up 10.5% in the 13-week period.

Sales of Predator increased 71.3% and and its market share increased 1.7 share points to 5.4%.\nThe Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of March 2023 compared to March 2022, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina to 53.5% and and in Chile from 36.4% to 42.7%. In Brazil for the month end March 2023, our share increased from 42.1% to 43.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

Net sales in Chile increased 36.3% in dollars and increased 36% in local currency in the 2023 first quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 13% in dollars and increased 98.8% in local currency in the 2023 first quarter.\nWe will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company, or MEC and Orange Bank, Inc. $175 million in damages, attorney's fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang Energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment.\nAdditionally, on September 29, 2022, adjourning in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, returned to voting to awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contract over shelf space with certain key retailers.\nOn April 12, 2023, the District Court granted MEC's motion for permanent injunction, which, amongst other things, enjoins VPX and former CEO, Jack Owa, for falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang or any other beverages contain creatine or a form of creatine. The parties have completed briefing the remaining post-trial issues.\nOn October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential clawback in certain circumstances.\nOn February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As this litigation on the bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call.\nIn the first quarter, we initially launched the Beast Unleashed in 6 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution into additional markets with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Net sales of the Beast Unleashed during the first quarter were $20.5 million. We recently relaunched Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. We are refreshing the Dale's beer brand, and we'll be introducing Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. We are planning to launch a new flavored malt beverage line within the next few months.\nOur Alcohol Beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing news of additional new products in the near future.\nWe launched a number of new products in the United States in the 2023 first quarter. In January 2023, Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched at retail. Monster Energy Zero Sugar is available in 16-ounce cans and was specifically developed as an indistinguishable 0 sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor.\nIn February 2023, we launched a new flavor within our highly successful Monster Ultra line with Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams available in 16-ounce cans.\nIn March 2023, we launched Reign Storm, which is positioned as a line of total wellness energy drinks in 12-ounce sleek cans to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. Reign Storm is available in 4 flavors: Valencia Orange, Kiwi Blend, Peach Nectarin and Harvest Grape. Also in March, we launched Rehab Monster Wild Berry Tea in 16-ounce cans. We are continuing to expand the distribution of Monster Tour Water in still and sparkling variants into additional states.\nWe launched several new SKUs in the first quarter in 2023 in Canada. In February 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen, Punch Monster Aussie Style Lemonade and Reign REIGNbow Sherbet. In March 2023, we launched Monster Zero Sugar in Canada.\nWe launched several new SKUs in the 2023 first quarter in Latin America. In Brazil, we launched Monster Ultra Watermelon. Additionally, we revamped our previous Khaos product into the new Monster Juice Khaotic. In Mexico, Predator Red Apple launched at retail to further expand our affordable energy offerings. In Uruguay, we launched our second Ultra SKU with Monster Ultra Paradise. In Paraguay and Bolivia, we launched our first juice SKU with Monster Juice Mango Loco. And additionally, in Bolivia, we launched Fury Gold Strike.\nIn the First quarter of 2023 in Australia, we launched 2 Java Monster SKUs, Java Monster Mean Bean and Java Monster Loca Moca. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Juicy Aussie Lemonade and Juice Khaotic in a number of countries.\nDuring the 2023 first quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink to an additional 22 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023, to be followed by another 8 markets in the second quarter of 2023.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In April 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023.\nWe estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2023 sales were approximately 9.9% higher than the comparable April '22 sales and 7.9% higher than April 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate April 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment, to be approximately 7.2% higher than in April 2022 and 5.1% higher than in April 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. April 2023 had 1 less selling day compared to April 2022.\nIn this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production.\nIn some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions, which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, we are seeing improvements in our gross profit margins quarterly sequential basis. Four, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our MEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Reign Storm and Tour Water in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar in EMEA.\nWe are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year.\nWe are excited by the additional alcohol opportunities that the Canarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the initial results of our launch of Reign Storm, our new line of total wellness energy drinks. Eight, finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries.\nI would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEO from Monster Beverage. Please go ahead.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly\n\nCFO, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.\nManagement cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.\nPlease refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter, 6.2% higher than net sales of $1.43 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 11.9% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global supply chain challenges and disruptions, the company has prioritized product availability for its consumers and customers despite adversely impacting gross margins and operating income.\nThe company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands.\nCANarchy was acquired in February 2022 to facilitate the company's entry into the alcohol beverage sector. During 2022, CANarchy sustained margin pressures, cost of acquisition and integration as well as certain other costs in preparation for the launch of the company's new alcohol product lines.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was 51.8% compared with 53.9% in the comparative 2021 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter as compared to the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of: one, increased ingredients and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, geographical and product sales mix; and three, increased logistical costs. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was partially offset by pricing actions.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory.\nThe depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters and should be fully utilized during 2023. We note that our major promotion in the fourth quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally. We estimate that of the increasing costs of sales in the 2022 fourth quarter, approximately $60 million, was comprised of: One, approximately $39.6 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including primary and secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, approximately $12.5 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and three, approximately $7.9 million due to increased logistical costs.\nWe continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.\nWe are starting to see a reduction in freight rates in the United States.\nOperating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter was $390 million compared with $354.7 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter were 25.8% compared with 24.9% in the 2021 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID.\nDistribution expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter increased to $76.1 million, which is an increase of 9% or 5% of net sales compared to $69.8 million or 0.9% of net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID.\nThe $6.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.2 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA, partially offset by decreased freight after expenses of $4.4 million. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses and increased general and administrative expenses.\nWe are now able to purchase aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters.\nWe have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our orbit strategy of producing closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs.\nOperating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.5% to $394.4 million from $412.9 million in the 2021 comparative quarter.\nNet income decreased 6.1% to $301.7 million as compared to $321.3 million in the 2021 comparable quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.9% to $0.57 from $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share, exclusive of the Alcohol segment operating losses and the adverse impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, net of tax, was $0.64 in the 2022 fourth quarter.\nThrough pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022, and will be implementing a price increase on its 24-ounce line effective April 1, 2023.\nThe company also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases on a phased approach during the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nAccording to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 11, 2023, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 13.1% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 11, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 15.1% over the same period the previous year.

Rockstar share was down 0.3 of a point to 3.7%. CELSIUS' share is 4.3%. Alani Nu's share is 0.7%. And GHOST's share is 2.5%.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 11, 2023, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 6.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 8.1% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 8% higher. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the 4 weeks ended February 11, 2023, was 54.7%, up 1 point while Starbucks Energy's share was 44.9%, up 0.8 of a point.\nAccording to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended December 31, 2022, the energy drink category increased 13.3% in dollars.

Monster sales increased 34.1%. Monster's market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.4% against the comparable period of the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 106.2%, and its market share increased 2 share points to 5.1%.\nThe Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen for the month of December 2022 compared to December 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 43% to 53.5%; in Chile, from 34.5% to 41.7%; in Brazil for the month end January 2023, our share increased from 39.9% to 41.1%. Monster is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January '23, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.2% to 15.2% in Belgium, from 30.7% to 31.8% in France, from 29.5% to 31% in Great Britain, from 27.3% to 32.7% in Norway, from 27.7% to 27.8% in the Republic of Ireland, from 38.6% to 40.4% in Spain and from 15.1% to 16.5% in Sweden.\nMonster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 8.1% to 4.7% in the Netherlands and from 20% to 19.2% in South Africa.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of December 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16.3% to 18.4% in the Czech Republic, from 26.5% to 27.8% in Denmark, and from 27.6% to 13.5% in Italy.\nMonster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 14.6% to 13.9% in Germany, from 38.1% to 36.8%, and decreased from 19% to 18.3% in Poland.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of December 2022, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 20.4% to 31.1% in Kenya and from 14.2% to 19.2% in Nigeria.\nAccording to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending January 29, 2023, increased from 13.1% to 16.1% as compared to the same period the previous year.

Sales in the 2022 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by COVID in certain channels.\nIn South Korea, net sales increased 13.9% in dollars and increased 34.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and in South Korea.\nIn China, sales volume in the fourth quarter increased 5.4% as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.\nIn Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 2.9% in dollars and 16.7% in local currencies.\nIn Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter increased 45.2% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.\nGross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 28.4% for the 2022 fourth quarter versus 38.6% in the 2021 fourth quarter.\nIn Brazil, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter increased by 19.9% in dollars and 16.6% in local currency.

We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy company, or MEC and Orange Bang, $175 million in damages, attorney fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment.\nAdditionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. The parties are briefing post-trial issues.\nOn October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential clawbacks in certain circumstances.\nOn February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As the litigation and bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed in 6 states through a network of beer distributors. The Beast Unleashed is a flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles.\nWe are pleased with early results and plan to expand into additional markets in the second quarter of 2023, with the goal of being national by the end of the year.\nWe recently launched Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's Beer family will get a refresh in the second quarter of 2023, including introduction of Dale's American Light Lager and easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbohydrates per 12-ounce serving. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future.\nIn the 2022 fourth quarter in the United States, Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle was launched at retail to expand Monster Reserve line. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched at retail in United States in January 2023. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor.\nEarlier this month, we also launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster Cafe Latte. Initial response from consumers has been positive.\nIn February 2023, we launched a flavor of Reign called Tropical Storm in the United States and also commenced with the launch of Monster Tour Water, a pure unflavored water line in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans. We are planning to launch Reign Storm, which is positioned as a total wellness energy drink in 12-ounce sleek cans at retail in March 2023 in 4 flavors to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category.\nWe launched several new SKUs in October in Latin America. In Chile, we expanded our Ultra line by launching Ultra Gold and Ultra Watermelon. In Mexico, we introduced Monster Energy Reserve Watermelon. In Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, Curacao and Bermuda,we expanded our Reign portfolio and launched Reign White Gummy Bear and Reign REIGNbow Sherbet. In Trinidad and Tobago, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch.\nIn Australia, we expanded our core portfolio and launched Monster Super Dry. In New Zealand, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juice Papillon, which is currently exceeding our expectations.\nIn EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro, Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple in a number of countries.\nIn certain countries, we also launched juiced Aussie Lemonade Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 fourth quarter. During the 2022 fourth quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn and Reign in certain countries.\nIn EMEA as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch, we commenced distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be followed by an additional 25 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Rehab lemon tea in Japan. Monster Ultra Watermelon in Turkey. Monster Ultra Paradise in Vietnam, Predator in Malaysia, and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC during the course of 2023.\nWe estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, January 2023 sales were approximately 16.1% higher than the comparable January 2022 sales and 13.8% higher than January 2022, excluding CANarchy. We estimate January 2023 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in January 2022 and 10.6% higher than in January 2022, excluding CANarchy.\nJanuary 2023 had the same number of selling days as January 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production.\nIn some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons.\nWe reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continues in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.\nOn November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock for a total amount of $201.6 million, excluding broker commissions under the June 2022 repurchase plan, leaving approximately 682.8 million remaining available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs.\nThe company today announced that its Board of Directors has approved and declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock that will be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on March 13, 2023, will receive a dividend of 1 additional share of common stock for each then held share to be distributed after the close of trading on March 27, 2023. The company anticipates its common stock to begin trading at the split adjusted price on March 28, 2023.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products; three, we are seeing improvement in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis due to supply chain normalization for our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for our 23 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, which launched in January 2023 in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 sugar energy drink in EMEA. We are also particularly enthusiastic for the planned launches of rainstorm in March 2023 as well as Tour Water in the United States.\nWe are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product in 6 states and the planned rollout in 2 additional states as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents.\nSeven, we are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. And finally, eight, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries.\nI would now like to open the floor to questions about the year. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Gentlemen, please go ahead.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly\n\nCFO, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations.\nManagement cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.\nPlease refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 third quarter, 15.2% higher than net sales of $1.41 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 20.2% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for the company's energy drinks, the company prioritized ensuring product availability for its customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions, despite adversely impacting the company's profitability.\nThe company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. During the 2022 third quarter, the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 third quarter, primarily due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, increased logistical costs, increased aluminum can costs and geographical and product sales mix.\nWe continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our higher-cost imported cans will continue over the next few quarters. However, our main promotion in the third quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally. We estimate that of the increasing cost of sales in the 2022 third quarter, approximately $84.2 million was comprised of approximately $40.1 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; 2, approximately $24.4 million due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans; 3, approximately $11.5 million due to increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing; and 4, approximately $8.2 million due to geographical and product sales mix.\nWe continue to air freight quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies to enable timely innovation launches. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third quarter was 51.3% compared with 55.9% in the 2021 third quarter, and 47.1% for the 2022 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third was partially offset by pricing actions, including the implementation of our general price increase in the United States effective September 1, 2022, price increases in certain international markets and reductions in promotions. Such pricing actions positively impacted gross profit margins in the 2022 third quarter.\nOperating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were $415.8 million compared with $344.7 million in the 2021 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were 25.6% compared to 24.4% in the 2021 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 third quarter increased to $83 million, which is an increase of 27.1% or 5.1% of net sales compared to $65.3 million or 4.6% of net sales in the 2021 third quarter and 3.3% of net sales in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. The $17.7 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.7 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA as well as increased freight out expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight.\nThe increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for travel and entertainment. Certain of these increases were the result of the company's return to activities consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters.\nWe have rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and the EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight, satisfy demand and to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in the freight-in costs.\nOperating income for the 2022 third quarter decreased 6% to $417.9 million from $444.5 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 4.4% to $322.4 million as compared to $337.2 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 third quarter decreased 3.9% and to $0.60 from $0.63 in the third quarter of 2021. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States, effective September 1, 2022.\nIn addition to price increases or pricing actions taken earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures, the company implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases early in 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nAccording to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through October 22, 2022, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.2% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 2022, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 10.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, increased 11.8% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

Sales of Red Bull were up 6.2%, Rockstar was up 8.1%, and 5-Hour was down 2.2%. VPX Bang sales decreased 27.3%.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 22, 2022, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 0.5 point to 36.9%. Monster share increased from 30.8% a year ago to 31.1%, Reign's share remained at 2.4%, NOS' share increased 0.1% to 2.5%, and Full Throttle's share remained at 0.7%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.4 points from 37.5% a year ago to 36.1%. VPX Bang's share decreased 2.5 points to 4.8%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.5 point at 4%. Rockstar's share was down 0.1 point to 3.7%. CELSIUS' share is 2.6%, Alani Nu share is 0.6%, and GHOST's share is 1.8%.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 22, 2022, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, were 10.4% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 17.4% higher, Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the 4 weeks ended October 22, 2022, was 52.1%, down 0.5 point, while Starbucks Energy share was 46.9%, up 2.4 points.\nAccording to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2022, the energy drink category increased 15.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 14.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 40.9%, down 0.3 point. Monster sales increased 17.3%, and its market share increased 0.5 point to 36.6%. NOS' sales decreased 11.6%, and its market share decreased 0.4 point to 1.3%. Full Throttle's sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.1 to 0.05%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 26% for the month of September 2022. Monster sales increased 36.4%. Monster's market share in value increased 2.2 points to 28.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 94% and its market share increased 1.5 share points to 4.4%.\nThe Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of September 2022 compared to September 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 47.9% to 51.7%, and in Brazil, from 37.7% to 41.8%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Brazil. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of September 2022 decreased from 42.2% to 41.7%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 9, 2020, Monster's reach or market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.5% to 15.5% in Belgium; from 26.6% and to 31% in France; from 28.9% to 29.9% in Great Britain; from 20.7% to 31.6% in Norway; and from 36.9% to 40.3% in Spain.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 11, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 27.4% to 27.9% in Denmark; from 27.5% to 28.1% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 13.6% to 15.5% in Sweden. Monster's market in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 7.8% to 5% in the Netherlands.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of August 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15% to 18.1% in the Czech Republic; from 15.3% to 15.6% in Germany; from 28.8% to 31.6% in Italy; and from 19.3% to 19.4% in Poland. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 38.6% to 38.4% in Greece; and from 20.1% to 19.6% in South Africa.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of August 2022, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 17.4% to 29.6% in Kenya; and from 11.9% to 17% in Nigeria.\nAccording to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending October 16, 2022, increased from 14.2% to 14.8% as compared to the same period the previous year.

According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended October 9, 2022, increased from 12.8% to 12.9% as compared to the same period the previous year.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.\nNet sales to customers outside the U.S. were $610.6 million, 37.6% of total net sales in the 2022 third quarter compared to $527.4 million or 37.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $71.3 million in the 2021 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.\nIn EMEA, net sales in the 2022 third quarter increased 14.1% in dollars and increased 30.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 34.7% compared to 37.7% in the same quarter in 2021, and compared to 26.7% in the second quarter of 2022. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden.\nIn Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 third quarter decreased 13.9% in dollars and decreased 1.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37.4% versus 43.5% over the same period in 2021, due in part to a product supply issue with an ingredient that impacted a number of our products in Japan, but which has now been resolved, net sales in the 2022 third quarter decreased 35.8% in dollars and decreased 21.2% in local currency. Sales in the 2022 third quarter remain impacted by COVID in certain channels.\nIn South Korea, Net sales decreased 8% in dollars but increased 4.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and in South Korea. In China, net sales decreased 6% in dollars and 1.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.\nIn Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 30.7% in dollars and 41.5% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 third quarter increased 63.8% in dollars and increased 74.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 97.8% in dollars and increased 166.2% in local currency in the 2022 third quarter.\nWe will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. We previously discussed the April 2022 final arbitration award, which the arbitrator found in favor of Monster Energy Company, or MEC, and Orange Bang Inc., and against VPX on all claims. The arbitrator awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX' past misconduct as well as attorney's fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bang's energy drinks and other Bang-branded products.\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang.\nOn September 29, 2022, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered final judgment confirming the award. On October 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal of the District Court's final judgment confirming the award. The company will not recognize the award or royalties until such time as they are realized or realizable. Additionally, on 29 September 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. MEC will not recognize the jury award until such time as the award is realized or realizable.\nOn October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. VPX initiated the bankruptcy action before the District Court could decide certain remaining issues. At this -- as this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are [sub-judicated], we will not be answering any questions on those matters on today's call.\nOur first alcohol-based product line to leverage Monster's brand equity is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2023. The Beast Unleashed will be a full-bodied flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume and will come in 4 bold flavors, Mean Green, White Haze, Peach Perfect and Scary Berries, all of which are based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles.\nCANarchy will introduce The Beast Unleashed through certain beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased approach launch, with the goal of being national by the end of 2023. Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust. In addition to The Beast Unleashed, we will relaunch Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's beer family will get a refresh, including the introduction of Dale's American Light Lager, an easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbs per 12-ounce serving. We also have several additional innovative alcohol beverage products under development and look forward to sharing [use] of those products at a later date.\nIn the U.S., in September, we began shipping Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle to distributors for an October launch at retail. We are excited about the planned launch of our new Monster Energy Zero Sugar energy drink initially in the United States at retail in January of 2023. Monster Energy's Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor.\nWe are planning to launch Monster Tour Water in the United States, in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans in the first half of 2023. Monster Tour Water is a pure unflavored water product. In the first half of 2023, we are also planning to launch [Reignstorm] in 4 flavors in 12-ounce slim cans to compete directly with certain competitive new entrants in the energy drink category in the United States.\nIn Puerto Rico, during July, we introduced our first 16-ounce 12-pack ultra variety packs. And in August, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and Reserve White Pineapple. In Mexico, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juiced Monarch in August. We launched Monster Dragon Tea Lemon in August in Honduras and El Salvador, and in September in Guatemala. In Australia, during the month of July, we expanded our Mother portfolio and launched Mother Lava Guava.\nIn EMEA, in the third quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Assault and Monster Reserve White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched Juiced Monarch, Juiced Khaotic, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 third quarter. During the 2022 third quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Reign in certain countries.\nWe are excited about the planned launch at retail of our new Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink initially in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022, followed by an additional 20 markets in the first quarter of 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we launched Predator in Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Jordan, and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022 and the first half of 2023. We also launched Monster Super Cola in a can in Japan in August and Monster Rehab Tea + Lemonade in October. We estimate October 2022 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 6.5% higher than in October 2021 and 5% higher than in October 2021, excluding CANarchy.\nOn a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, October 2022 sales would have been approximately 12.9% higher than the comparable October 2021 sales, and 11.4% higher than October 2021, excluding CANarchy. October 2022 had the same number of selling days as October 2021. The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing filling capacity across all regions to address demand for October.\nWe would like to remind listeners that we took a general price increase in the United States effective September 1, 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases, promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.\nTurning briefly to share repurchases. During the 2022 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock, and as of November 3, 2022, approximately $182.8 million remained available for repurchase under the June 2022 repurchase program. The Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, consumer demand remains solid, even with the pricing actions that have been taken in 2022. Two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products. Three , our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. Four, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. Five, we are particularly excited for the launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in January 2023 in the United States.\nAs I mentioned previously, Monster Zero Sugar is an analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. Six, we are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international markets and countries. We are also pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries.\nWe are enthusiastic for the planned launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product and for the opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are also enthusiastic for the planned launches of the Monster Tour Water and Reignstorm lines in the first half of 2023 in the United States. Ten, we believe that we will be able to address many of the challenges we have experienced in our supply chain. Eleven, we consider that certain of the increased costs that we have experienced in the quarter may well be transitory. For example, the LME price for aluminum has reduced materially from its recent March highs, and we are beginning to see a reduction in freight costs as well as reductions in the cost of shipping containers and ocean freight.\nI would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

My name is Devin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the conference call. (Operator Instructions)\nMr. Rodney Sacks, you may begin your conference.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer.\nTom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly\n\nCFO, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nNow before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations.\nManagement cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.\nPlease refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on the specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom. The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 second quarter, 13.2% higher than net sales of $1.46 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 16.9% higher on foreign currency adjusted basis.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for the company's energy drinks, the company prioritized ensuring product availability for its customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions despite adversely impacting the company's profitability.\nThe company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. During the 2022 second quarter, the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 second quarter, primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees.\nIncreased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, geographical and product sales mix and production inefficiencies. The company estimates that of the increase in cost of sales in the 2022 second quarter of $250.3 million, approximately $164.4 million was comprised of 1, approximately $66.7 million due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans; two, approximately $45.9 million due to increased ingredient and other import costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; three, approximately $27.5 million due to increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing; four, approximately $15.1 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and five, approximately $9.2 million due to production inefficiencies.\nThe company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products. As a result, the company continued to air freight substantial quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies.\nFurthermore, the company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continued to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 second quarter was 47.1% compared to 57.2% in the 2021 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 second quarter was partially offset by pricing actions.\nOperating expenses for the 2022 second quarter were $406.9 million compared with $310.9 million in the 2021 second quarter. The comparative operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter included a $16.9 million reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim.\nAs a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 second quarter were 24.6% compared with 21.3% in the 2021 second quarter and 25.6% in the 2019 second quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 second quarter increased to $87.9 million, which is an increase of 36% or 5.3% of net sales compared to $64.6 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2021 second quarter and 3.4% of net sales in the 2019 second quarter pre-COVID.\nThe $23.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to increased freight out expenses of $13.5 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight, as well as higher warehouse expenses of $9.7 million as a result of higher raw material and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA.\nThe increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for travel and entertainment. Certain of these increases were the result of the company's return to activities consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels.\nWe have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in both the U.S. and EMEA. We anticipate seeing a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters.\nWe rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight to satisfy demand and to return to our Orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs.\nOperating income for the 2022 second quarter decreased 29.1% to $373.0 million from $526 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 32.3% to $273.4 million as compared to $403.8 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 second quarter decreased 32.2% to $0.51 from $0.75 in the second quarter of 2021.\nThrough pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company is implementing a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022.\nThe company will also be implementing price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets, some in addition to price increases or pricing actions taken earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures.\nAccording to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2022, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 8.2% versus the same period a year ago.\nSales of the company's energy brands, including Reign, were up 6% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster were up 7.4%. Sales of Reign were down 5.6%. Sales of NOS decreased 3.9%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 3.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 2.1%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased 3%. VPX Bang's sales decreased 14.5%. The sales growth of the Monster brand exceeded that Red Bull in the period.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2022, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 6.6% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, increased 5.6% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 6.4% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 0.9%, NOS was down 1.8% and Full Throttle was down 2.5%. Sales of Red Bull were up 3.9%. Rockstar was down 1.8% and 5-hour down 3.5%. VPX Bang sales decreased 16.3%.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2022, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, decreased 0.4 of a point to 36.1%. Monster share decreased from 30.6% a year ago to 30.5%. Reign share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.3%. NOS share decreased 0.2 of a point to 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%.\nRed Bull share decreased 1 percentage point from 37.4% a year ago to 36.4%. Rockstar share was down 0.3 of a point to 3.5%, 5-hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point at 4.2% and VPX Bang share decreased 1.6 points to 6%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2022, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 4.4% over the same period the previous year.\nSales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 2.3% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 9.4% higher. Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2022, was 50.9%, down 1 point, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.7%, up 2.2 points.\nAccording to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 18, 2022, the energy drink category increased 12.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 8.5% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 40%, down 1.6 points. Monster sales increased 10.8% and its market share decreased 0.7 of a point to 34.8%. NOS' sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 1.5%. Full Throttle sales increased 13%, and its market share remained at 0.6%.\nAccording to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 21.2% for the month of June 2022. Monster sales increased 26.9%. Monster's market share in value increased 1.3 points to 28.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 53.1% and its market share increased 0.8 of a share point to 4%.\nThe Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of June 2022 compared to June 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 46.9% to 49.2%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading brand in value in Argentina.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of June 2022 compared to June 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 35.7% to 39.9%. Monster is now the leading energy brand in value in Brazil, marking another important milestone for our brand in South America. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of June 2022 decreased from 41.9% to 38.1% due to a shortage of shipping containers.\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 17, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 25.8% to 31.6% in France from 27.8% to 32.1% in Norway and from 37.6% to 39.7% in Spain.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of June 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 15.3% to 16% in Belgium from 15.1% to 15.4% in Germany, from 28.9% to 29.9% in Great Britain and from 19.4% to 19.8% in Poland. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 20.5% to 20% in South Africa.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 19, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.5% to 15.6% in Sweden. Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period the previous year declined from 8.5% to 6.6% in the Netherlands and from 29.3% to 28.1% in the Republic of Ireland.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of May 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 15% to 17.5% in the Czech Republic and from 37.9% to 38.7% in Greece.

According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of May 2022, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 17.1% to 26.8% in Kenya and from 8.1% to 15.4% in Nigeria.\nAccording to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the month ending July 3, 2022, increased from 13.2% to 14.2% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 11.5% to 10.2% during the same period. The market share of the company's brands in Australia for the month ended July 3, 2022, decreased from 24.7% to 24.5%.\nAccording to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended July 10, 2022, increased from 12.4% to 12.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+'s market share in value decreased from 6.9% to 6.5% and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 5.3%. The market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the 4 weeks ended July 10, 2022, decreased from 25.6% to 24.5%.\nAccording to INTAGE in Japan, in the month ending June 2022, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 50.6% to 56.7%.\nAccording to Nielsen, in South Korea, in the last month ending June 2022, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year decreased from 61.9% to 59.9%. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.\nNet sales to customers outside the U.S. were $649 million, 39.2% of total net sales in the 2022 second quarter compared to $546.3 million or 37.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $53.4 million in the 2022 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.\nIn EMEA, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased 13.8% in dollars and increased 26.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 26.7% compared to 39.8% in the same quarter in 2021. Gross profit in the second quarter was impacted by increased freight for imported cans, increased raw material and ingredient costs and increased co-packing fees, higher aluminum commodity pricing and air freight costs.\nIn local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 27.1%. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.\nIn Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 second quarter decreased 1.1% in dollars and increased 8.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.4% versus 44.4% over the same period in 2021.\nIn Japan, net sales in the 2022 second quarter decreased 9.6% in dollars and increased 3.3% in local currency. Sales performance for the comparable period in 2021 was largely impacted due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan. In South Korea, net sales decreased 5.2% in dollars and increased 3.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea.\nIn China, net sales decreased 2.1% in dollars and 1.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.\nIn Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 1.3% in dollars and 7.6% in local currencies. Sales in Australia and New Zealand were negatively impacted by shipping delays of certain flavors, concentrates and ingredients. Furthermore, sales in Australia were also impacted by severe flooding in that country in the 2022 second quarter.\nIn Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased 66.7% in dollars and increased 69.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 36.4% for the 2022 second quarter versus 40.7% in the 2021 second quarter.\nIn Brazil, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased by 82.8% in dollars and 63.9% in local currency. Net sales in Mexico increased 49.3% in dollars and 49% in local currency in the 2022 second quarter. Net sales in Chile increased 26.1% in dollars and 45.3% in local currency in the 2022 second quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 200.1% in dollars and 269.4% in local currency in the 2022 second quarter.\nI will now provide the most recent update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which I'll refer to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. In June 2020, once the energy company, which I will refer to as MEC and Orange Bang, Inc., a family-owned beverage business and the rightful owner of several trademark registrations to the Bang marks, initiated an arbitration against VPX.\nMEC and Orange Bang alleged that VPX reached a 2010 settlement agreement with Orange Bang that restricted VPX's use of the Bang trademark to products that are creatine-based or marketed and sold only in nutritional channels, as well as claims that VPX infringed Orange Bang's trademark rights to the Bang marks.\nIn April 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding in favor of MEC and Orange Bang on all claims.\nThe arbitrator awarded MEC and Orange Bang, $175 million to remedy VPX's past misconduct as well as attorneys' fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang, an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bang's energy drinks and other Bang-branded products.\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. On July 1, 2022, the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted MEC and Orange Bang's motion to confirm the arbitrator's award and denied VPX's motion to vacate the arbitrator's award.\nMEC and Orange Bang have requested that the court end to final judgment. On July 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the non-circuit. The company will not recognize the award or royalties until such time as they are realized or realizable.\nYesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a ruling affirming the decision of the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida, in which the District Court rejected VPX's claim that MEC's line of Reign energy drinks infringed the trade dress of its line of Bang energy drinks.\nMEC's lawsuit against VPX for false advertising, unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets in the Central District of California is still pending with trial scheduled to begin later this month. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subdued again, I will not be answering any questions on those matters on today's call.\nThe first alcohol-based product line that we plan to launch since the acquisition of CANarchy will be a full [bodied] flavored malt beverage that will be launched late in the 2022 fourth quarter under the brand name the Beast Unleashed. Beast Unleashed will leverage Monster's brand equity while carving out its own unique space in the beverage alcohol sector and will be distinguishable from the many hard seltzer brands that have become so ubiquitous over the last several years.\nThe Beast Unleashed will have a 6% alcohol content by volume and will come in 4 great tasting bold flavors which are based on certain of Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles. Beast Unleashed will be launched through beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased state launch approach with the goal of being national by the end of 2023 and will initially be offered in 16-ounce single-serve cans as well as a 12-can variety pack in 12-ounce sleek cans.\nOur alcohol innovation pipeline is robust with a number of additional innovative product lines currently under development. We look forward to sharing use of such additional alcohol beverage products at a later date. We're excited about the planned launch of our new Monster Energy Zero Sugar energy drink in the 2022 fourth quarter initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable Zero Sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunity that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor.\nIn April of 2022, we launched Pure North Energy Seltzer in sleek 355 ml cans in 3 flavors Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry and Grapefruit Lemonade in Canada. At the end of June 2022, we expanded our core Monster Energy portfolio in Canada by launching Monster Reserve in 2 flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple, both in 473 ml cans.\nIn Latin America, we introduced several new energy drinks in our Monster Energy Predator and Fury product lines in certain Latin American countries in the 2022 second quarter. In April 2022 in New Zealand, we launched Live+ Watermelon, our fourth Live+ flavor. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched Juiced Monarch and Khaotic during the 2022 second quarter.\nDuring the 2022 second quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Relentless, Nalu and Reign in certain countries. During the second quarter of 2022, we launched Predator in Turkey and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India and Vietnam in June, expanding the brand to East India and North Vietnam. We also launched Predator in Cambodia in July 2022. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the second half of 2022.\nIn Japan, we launched Monster Super Fuel Killer Kiwi and Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise in China. We estimate July 2022 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in July 2021 and 11.2% higher than in July 2021, excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding CANarchy July 2022 sales would have been approximately 16.6% higher than the comparable July 2021 sales. July 2022 has had 1 less selling day compared to July 2021.\nThe company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing facility -- capacity across all regions to address demand for July. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.\nWe reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue, in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company is increasing its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products. Two, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. Three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. Four, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries.\nFive, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. Sixth, we are enthusiastic for the planned launch of the Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product and for the opportunity that the CANarchy acquisition presents.\nSeven, we believe that we will be able to address many of the challenges we have experienced in our supply chain. Eight, we consider that certain of the increased costs we have experienced in the quarter may well be transitory. For example, the current cost of aluminum has reduced materially from its recent March highs, and we are beginning to see a reduction in fuel and freight costs as well as reductions in the cost of shipping containers and ocean freight.\nI would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThank you. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.52 billion in the 2022 first quarter, 22.1% higher than net sales of $1.24 billion in the 2021 comparable period. As in recent quarters, to meet increased demand for our products, rather than experience out of stocks for certain lines at retail, the company incurred operational inefficiencies in the United States and in various countries, resulting in increased costs.\nDuring the 2022 first quarter, the company continued to procure additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States and abroad in response to increased consumer demand. In the first quarter of 2022, the company experienced significant increases in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 first quarter, primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, as well as aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing.\nThe company also experienced a significant increase in ingredient and other input costs, secondary packaging materials, co-packing fees and production inefficiencies. The company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products.\nThis necessitated the company air freighting substantial quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continued to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.\nIn the United States, the company secured additional co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of its products. The company estimates that approximately $46 million of costs in the quarter were the result of operating inefficiencies due in part to strong consumer demand, including the importation of aluminum cans, as well as COVID-19-related issues such as port congestion, shortage of shipping containers resulting in the need to airfreight ingredients, which the company continues to address.\nIn addition, increased commodity and raw materials costs, including aluminum, other ingredient costs and secondary packaging incurred during the quarter, amounted to approximately $45 million, and increases in freight rates and fuel impacted gross profits by approximately $6 million.\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2022 first quarter was 51.1% compared with 57.5% in the 2021 frist quarter. The decrease in gross profit percentage for the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of the items mentioned previously as well as geographical sales mix.\nAdditionally, [Drop] requires a first value step-up of the CANarchy inventories of $3.8 million, which together with expenses related to the acquisition of CANarchy of $4.2 million during the quarter, adversely affected both gross margins and operating expenses.\nThe decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 first quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Operating expenses for the 2022 first quarter was $377.2 million, compared with $300.8 million in the 2021 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 first quarter were 24.8% compared with 24.2% in the 2021 first quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2022 first quarter increased to $81.4 million, which is an increase of 49.7% or 5.4% of net sales compared to $54.4 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2021 first quarter.\nThe $27 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to increased freight out costs of $20.6 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight, as well as higher warehouse expenses of $6.4 million as a result of higher raw material and finished good product inventories in the United States and EMEA. We believe that a portion of the increase in distribution expenses that we experienced in the quarter are likely to be transitory.\nThe increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased expenditures for travel and entertainment, increased payroll expenses, increased professional services expenses, including accounting and legal expenses, increased commissions and increased sponsorships and endorsements. During the comparative 2021 first quarter, the company decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment as well as our marketing programs largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on such expenses during the 2022 first quarter.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 first quarter were 24.8% as compared to operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 first quarter pre-COVID, which was 27.7%.\nOur 2 new suppliers of aluminum cans in the United States are now operational. And as a result, we are able to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminum cans in the United States. In the United States, we anticipate seeing a reduction in cost of sales related to the use of imported aluminum cans in the latter half of 2022. Although, we expect to reduce the importation of aluminum cans into EMEA in the second half of 2022, we will only see a reduction in cost of sales after we have worked through current inventories of imported cans in EMEA.\nWe rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce excessive cost of long-distance freight to satisfy demand and to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in cost.\nOperational income -- sorry, operating income for the 2022 first quarter decreased 3.5% to $399.5 million from $414.1 million in the 2021 comparative quarter, primarily due to the company's operations in EMEA and Asia Pacific.\nNet income decreased 6.7% to $294.2 million as compared to $315.2 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 first quarter decreased 6.8% to $0.55 from $0.59 in the first quarter of 2021.\nThrough pricing actions during the quarter, the company was able to record positive pricing actions in excess of 3% in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company is planning for a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022. The company is also monitoring the opportunity for additional pricing actions internationally as well as in United States.\nAccording to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 23, 2022, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.5% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 2.4% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 11.7% lower. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily included Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee, for the 4 weeks ended April 23, 2022, was 55.3%, up 4.2 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 42.9%, down 3.1 points.\nAccording to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2022, the energy drink category increased 13.5% in dollars.

Monster sales increased 28.9%. Monster's market share in value increased 0.8 of a share point to 28.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 67% and its market share increased 0.9 of a share point to 3.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of March 2022 compared to March 2021, Monster's retail market share in value decreased in Argentina from 45.2% to 45%. Monster's Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of March -- month of March 2022 compared to March 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 34.9% to 40.2%. Monster is now the leading energy brand in value in Brazil, marking another important milestone for our brand in South America.\nIn Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of March 2022, decreased from 40% to 36.3%, due to a shortage of shipping containers. Our bottler in Chile is in the process of validating its new production line in order to increase our in-country production.\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending April 2, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period of the previous year, grew from 14.7% to 16.2% in Germany.

Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $32.9 million in the 2022 first quarter.\nIncluded in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.\nIn EMEA, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 21.8% in dollars and increased 30% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, for the first quarter was 29.6% compared to 37.3% in the same quarter in 2021. Gross profit in the first quarter was impacted by higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased freight for imported cans, increased raw material and ingredient costs, as well as airfreight costs.\nIn -- the company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 first quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.\nIn Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 1.9% in dollars and increased 9.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Sales decreased over the same period in 2021, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\nIn South Korea, net sales increased 71.7% in dollars and 86.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea.\nIn China, net sales decreased 8.9% in dollars and 10.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.\nIn Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 13.8% in dollars and 7.9% in local currencies. Sales in Australia and New Zealand were negatively impacted by shipping delays of certain flavors, concentrates and ingredients. Furthermore, sales in Australia were also impacted by severe flooding in that country in the 2022 first quarter.\nIn Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 52.5% in dollars and increased 59.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 103.1% in dollars and 146.4% in local currency in the 2022 first quarter.\nI will now discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which I will refer to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. In June 2020, Monster Energy Company, which I will refer to as MEC and Orange Bang, Inc., a family-owned beverage business and the rightful owner of several trademark registrations to the Bang marks, initiated an arbitration against VPX.\nMEC and Orange Bang allege that VPX reached a 2010 settlement agreement with Orange Bang that restricted VPX's use of the Bang trademark to products that are creatine-based or marketed and sold only in nutritional channels as well as claims at VPX infringed Orange Bang's trademark rights to the Bang marks.\nIn April 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding in favor of MEC and Orange Bang on all claims. The arbitrator found that VPX's Bang Energy Drinks, which VPX advertisers containing super creatine and other Bang branded products do not contain creatine, and do not provide the benefits of creatine. Because Bang branded products are thus not creatine-based, and are not limited to nutritional channels, the arbitrator found they are being sold in breach of the settlement agreement. The arbitrator also found that VPX's Bang branded product infringe Orange Bang's trademarks.\nThe arbitrated rewarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX's past misconduct and attorney's fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future net sales of Bang products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang.\nUnder the arbitrator's order, if VPX fails to pay the royalty, VPX is prohibited from using the Bang mark, subject to certain limited exceptions. MEC and Orange Bang have filed a motion to confirm the arbitrator's award. VPX has filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award. A hearing on VPX's motion is scheduled for June 27, 2022.\nMEC's lawsuit against VPX for false advertising, unfair competition, and misappropriation of trade secrets in the Central District of California is still pending, with trials scheduled to begin in August 2022. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on those matters in today's call.\nIn January of 2022, we introduced our first 16-ounce Ultra Variety 12 packs, which are being well received by consumers, and we are continuing to expand our multi-pack portfolio in the 2022 first quarter. In February of 2022, we introduced new flavor innovations with Ultra Peachy Keen, Juice Monster Aussie Style Lemonade, Rehab Watermelon and Reign Reignbow Sherbet.\nIn February 2022, we launched our newest brand nationally, True North Pure Energy Seltzer in 4, 12-ounce flavors through the Coca-Cola distribution network. At the end of the 2022, 1st quarter, we launched 2 new ready-to-drink nitro-infused coffee products, Java Monster Cold Brew Latte and Java Monster Cold Brew Sweet Black. In Canada, in January of 2022, we introduced Monster Ultra Gold. In February of 2022, we grew Canada's Reign portfolio by launching Reign White Gummy Bear.\nWe successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the first quarter of 2022. In Argentina, we launched VR46 The Doctor. In Chile, we expanded our Reign Lemon by launching Melon Mania, Lemonades and Orange Dreamsicle. In Mexico, we launched our second Predator SKU with Predator Mean Green. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in Puerto Rico and Monster Mango Loco in Colombia.\nIn the 2022 first quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Gold and Mother Kiwi Sublime in Australia and New Zealand. We launched our third Super Fuel flavor in Tropical Thunder.\nIn EMEA, in the first quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries. We also launched Ultra Fiesta, Watermelon and Gold and Juiced Monarch, Khaotic and Pacific Punch in a number of countries during the 2022 first quarter.\nDuring the 2022 first quarter, we also launched Predator and Reign in additional countries. During the first quarter of 2020, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Singapore. We also introduced the Predator brand in India. In April 2022, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Japan. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the course of 2022.\nOur co-packing network is an integral part of the company's production model, which we intend to preserve. The owner of one of the co-packing facilities with which we contracted located in Norwalk, California, announced earlier this year that they would be selling this facility and ceasing its operations at this facility. To maintain adequate supply of the company's products, we have acquired the associated real property, leases and equipment of this co-packing facility for a purchase price of $62.5 million. Following the purchase, the facility will be closed for a period of time, before the company is able to commence production.\nWe estimate April 2022 sales including CANarchy to be approximately 6.7% higher than in April 2021 and 4.8% higher than in April 2021, excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding CANarchy, April 2022 sales would have been approximately 7.7% higher than the comparable April 2021 sales. April 2022 had 1 less selling day compared to April 2021.\nWe mentioned that April 2022 sales had a challenging hurdle to meet over April 2021 sales. You may recall that in our 2021 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we estimated that April 2021 sales were approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative 2020 sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we estimated that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales. April 2021, April 2020 and April 2019, all had the same number of selling days.\nThe company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing filling capacity across all regions to address demand for April. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.\nWe reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to address challenges in its supply chain by sourcing cans and primary ingredients and blends, increasing its manufacturing capacity and increasing finished product inventories. This should enable us to improve our service levels and lower transportation costs across North America, EMEA and LatAm. Our AFF's flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region.\nWe are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign, Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries.\nWe are enthusiastic about the opportunities that CANarchy presents. While we believe that we will be able to address many of the supply chain challenges we have faced, we anticipate still having to face certain ongoing challenges in the future.\nI would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThanks. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer.\nTom will now read our cautionary statement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly\n\nCFO, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nNow before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations.\nManagement cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, including the sections contained therein Risk Factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks\n\nCo-CEO & Chairman, Monster Beverage Corporation\n\nThanks, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year net sales with annual net sales topping the $5.5 billion mark for the first time in the company's history. Despite certain challenges in the 2021 fourth quarter, the company achieved solid results overall. We note that the comparative 2020 fourth quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $165.1 million as well as reduced marketing, sponsorships and certain other operating expenses, largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These items should be taken into consideration when evaluating comparative performance over the 2020 fourth year and full year -- fourth quarter and full year.\nDuring the 2021 fourth quarter, the company continued to procure additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States and abroad in response to increased consumer demand. In addition, the company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion and delays in the receipt of certain ingredients. In the United States, the company lacked sufficient co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of its products. As a result, the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand for its products in a number of markets in the 2021 fourth quarter.\nDuring the 2021 fourth quarter, the company experienced increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans. In addition, the company experienced increased ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, increased outbound freight costs and production and efficiencies, which resulted in increased costs of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 fourth quarter.\nThe company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.43 billion compared with $1.20 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 19.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter would have been up 19.3%. The comparative net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to prior returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and labeling issue concerning 1 product in Japan, which we will refer to as the 2020 product returns.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter was 53.9% compared with 57.7% in the 2020 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of increased freighting costs, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, geographical and product sales mix and production inefficiencies.\nOperating expenses for the 2021 fourth quarter were $334.7 million compared with $288.4 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 fourth quarter were 24.9% compared with 24.1% in the 2020 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased outbound freight and warehouse costs, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for other marketing activities including social media and digital marketing and increased payroll costs. During the comparative 2020 fourth quarter, the company decreased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on our sales and marketing programs during the 2021 fourth quarter. Distribution costs for the 2021 fourth quarter increased to $69.8 million, which is an increase of 48.4% or 4.9% of net sales compared to $47 million or 3.9% of net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter.\nOperating income increased 2.6% to $412.9 million from $402.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe that a portion of the increase in costs that we experienced in the quarter and the 2021 full year are likely to be transitory. With our 2 new suppliers of aluminum cans in the United States operational, we will begin to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminum cans in the United States, although we will continue to import aluminum cans into the United States, although at a reduced level in the first half of 2022.\nIn 2022, we expect to continue to import aluminum cans into EMEA reducing such imports in the second half of 2022. The supply chain challenges we are experiencing are significantly increasing and the logistic costs of importing and shipping raw materials and ingredients as well as other freighting costs, which are included in cost of sales. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. We are rebuilding and increasing inventories in an effort to reduce the excessive cost of trucking long distances to satisfy demand and to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing in proximity to our customers.\nIncreased freight in costs, including the shipment cost of importing cans amounted to approximately $38 million in the 2021 fourth quarter and approximately $100 million for the 2021 full year. Our out-of-orbit freight costs, which are included in distribution expenses amounted to approximately $15 million in the 2021 fourth quarter and $54 million for the 2021 full year.\nNet income decreased 31.9% to $321.3 million as compared to $471.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by the recognition of a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million. Net income for the comparative 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the nonrecurring tax benefits, the impact of the 2020 product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was $328.6 million.\nDiluted earnings per share for the 2021 fourth quarter decreased 32.1% to $0.60 from $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the comparative 2020 fourth quarter excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the 2020 product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was $0.62.\nAccording to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through February 12, 2022, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 13.3% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of VPX Bang increased 0.4%.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 1, 2022, and sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 7.4% over the same period the previous year.

Sales of Predator increased 38.3% and its market share increased 0.3 of a share point to 3.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.\nAccording to Nielsen for the month of January 2022 compared to January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 41.3% to 43.8%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.\nAccording to Nielsen, for the month of January 2022 compared to January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 32.2% to 37.8%. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of January 2022 decreased from 47.2% to 33.1% due to a shortage of shipping containers.\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. In addition, the company experienced supply issues in EMEA during 2021, which impacted the Nielsen statistics in different countries.\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 29, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 27.3% to 29.5% in Great Britain, from 7.9% to 8.1% in the Netherlands and from 36.8% to 38.4% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.\nNet sales to customers outside the U.S. were $508.1 million, which is 35.7% of total net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to $384.8 million or 32.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020.

In 2021 fourth quarter, can supply shortages, lack of ingredient availability, it's sufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability together had an adverse impact on sales in EMEA. In some cases, impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. However, the shortages of trucking availability will largely resolve in the latter part of the quarter. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA by continuing to import cans and expanding its co-packing capacity.\nWe are also pleased that in the 2021 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.\nIn Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 19.2% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2020.

Without the impact of the 2020, product returns in Japan net sales decreased 1.2% in dollars and increased 5.2% in local currency over the same period in 2020, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\nIn South Korea, net sales increased 31.3% in dollars and 35.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020.

There are a number of pending proceedings with VPX but as they are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.\nIn the United States, we launched our new True North Pure Energy Seltzer line in e-commerce and selected natural channels in the third quarter. In early 2022, we launched this said line nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers. In October 2021, we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in 2 flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple. We have launched multiple innovation SKUs, 2 new 12-ounce flavors as well as new package configurations in the 2022 first quarter.

In the 2022 first quarter in Canada, we are planning to launch 9 new innovations, including the transition into a 355 ml 8-pack for Monster Energy, Zero Ultra and Ultra Paradise.

In Honduras, we expanded our Fury package offerings with the 355 mL returnable glass bottle. We are planning a national launch of Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign, Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mango Magic in Brazil in the first half of 2022.\nAdditional 2022 first quarter LatAm innovations include Monster Zero Sugar in Ecuador, Pipeline Punch in Central America and Trinidad Monster Mango Loco in Peru and Colombia and VR46, the doctor in Argentina.

We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the course of 2022. We are planning to launch a number of additional products or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.\nOn February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective, a craft beer and hard sales for company for $330 million in cash subject to adjustments. The transaction brings the Cigar City, Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA, Oskar Blues, Dale's Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzer, Deep Ellum, Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA, Perrin Brewing, Black Ale, Squatters, Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA and Wasatch, Apricot Hefeweizen brands to our beverage portfolio.\nThe transaction does not include CANarchy stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. CANarchy will function independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that this acquisition presents to us in the alcohol space and through their distribution network.\nWe estimate January 2022 sales to be approximately 20.2% higher than in January 2021. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January '22 sales would have been approximately 23% higher than the comparable January 2021 sales. January 2022 had 1 more selling day than January 2021. Although we see some improvement, the company has continued to experience supply chain challenges in January, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.\nWe reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are continuing to experience increased costs in our operations, some of which may be transitory, and we have and are in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate against such increased costs.\nOur AFF flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region and will improve service levels in EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. Our supply chain challenges are improving. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that CANarchy presents.\nI would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

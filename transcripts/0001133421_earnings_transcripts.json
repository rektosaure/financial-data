Today's call is being recorded. My name is Bella, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Bella, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2025 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In addition, we will refer to a presentation that is posted to our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Ken Crews, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Disciplined execution of our business strategy has continued to position us well as global defense demand grows and our customers transform the way they acquire capability. We continue to prioritize providing technology leadership to our customers through innovation in both the way we do business and the capabilities we deliver. In doing so, we are building a strong backlog of future business. We are also performing well on our current programs, building the capacity for sustainable growth and transforming our operations by embracing digital technologies to deliver with speed, quality and affordability.\nThe Northrop Grumman team delivered another strong quarter of performance amidst a dynamic global environment. We achieved mid-single-digit growth, expanded our segment operating margin and grew free cash flow year-over-year. These results are aligned to our long-term financial outlook. The investments we have been making in capacity and capability over the last 6 years, enables us to deliver with urgency against our customers' highest priority. In fact, we achieved an exceptionally strong book-to-bill of 1.17 in the quarter.\nOur organic growth rate was 5% year-over-year and our international growth rate was 32%. It is also worth noting that apart from our Space segment, where we continue to have a challenging compare related to the wind-down of 2 large programs, revenue growth was approximately 9%. Despite strong growth in the quarter, we are revising our full year revenue guidance down due to delayed timing on certain awards and programs.\nIn addition, the team delivered another outstanding quarter of operating performance. Segment operating margin increased to 12.3% in Q3, which drove a 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. We also increased our free cash flow by 72% year-over-year and are on track to meet our full year guidance.\nIn the quarter, we made significant strides across multiple programs to position our company for the future. Last month, the second B-21 aircraft in our flight test, another significant milestone for the program as we continue to gain momentum. This starts a new phase of the test program, transitioning from general flight performance evaluation to integrating weapons and mission systems.\nOur testing campaign also involves multiple B-21 aircraft undergoing ground tests prior to flying, which is validating performance and minimizing risk. With the progress we've made, we remain on track to receive the Lot 3 and Lot 5 advanced procurement awards later this year.\nWe continue discussions with the Air Force on the framework for an agreement to accelerate the B-21 production rate. If an agreement is reached, as previously disclosed, we expect to deploy additional investments to achieve the increased rate with the opportunity to earn improved returns.\nWe've also made important progress on missile defense program that can support emerging requirements. In the quarter, we received a multibillion-dollar extension on the ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon systems contract. This contract award extends our period of performance through 2030 to provide new GMD capability. GWS is an integrated system designed to protect the U.S. from long-range ballistic missile threats. System enhancements, including integrating the next-generation interceptor into the GMD system, updating launch equipment and advancing the communication capabilities between the GWS and the Interceptor fleet.\nIn addition, IBCS continues to be an effective and ready-now solution to meet the global air and missile defense mission. In this quarter, IBCS successfully completed live fire testing events for both Poland and the U.S. Army customers, continuing its record of strong performance in operational tests. With these latest events, IBCS is now 32 for 32 in successful flight tests. We are also advancing the capability to introduce cloud and mobile technologies into IBCS as well as enhanced artificial intelligence.\nWe have demonstrated our ability to rapidly adapt to changing mission requirements, adding new operations capabilities through software in a matter of hours to effectively defeat evolving threats. I have previously outlined the investments we've made in solid rocket motor capacity and capabilities over the last several years. Leveraging those investments in the quarter our GEM 63XL rocket boosters played a crucial role in powering a ULA Vulcan Rocket that delivered the third at of Amazon Hyper satellites to orbit. With additional launches in backlog, the Hyper program is poised to be a key growth driver for the company going forward.\nAdditionally, we've self-funded investments in tactical solid rocket motor capabilities that have enabled us to pursue and plan that can source opportunities. Recently, we were selected by the Navy as a second supplier for the SM-6 missile. This is one of several initiatives, including the 21-inch motor award that we discussed on our last call that we've undertaken to enhance our SRM competitiveness and broaden our market presence. There are many notable accomplishments from the quarter, but let me now take a step back for a moment and talk about the transformation that is underway in the Department of Ward and how they acquire capability and what they see from an industry partner like Northrop Grumman.\nI noted earlier that we are innovating, both in the capabilities we deliver and the ways we work. We are bringing proposals forward to accelerate our program. embrace new technology and partner more effectively. We also continue to invest in American factories and workers where we design and build the most advanced systems and technologies in support of our nation's war fighters. Over the past 2 years, we've allocated over 4% of our sales towards capital expenditures, well above industry averages. This investment is essential in providing the capacity to meet demand for next-generation aircraft capabilities, ramping up production in munitions and propulsion, laying the foundation for significant growth in microelectronics and expanding production facilities to deliver hundreds of satellites and aircraft.\nWe have also invested over $2 billion in the infrastructure and development of our enterprise-wide digital ecosystem that continues to yield phenomenal results. As we test and prove that digital models have extremely high correlation with the physical product we are delivering. This is game-changing for the way we design, build and produce our products. It opens paths for more affordable solutions for our customers and more predictable and improved returns for our shareholders. And as we look even further over the horizon to 5 or 10 years into the future and beyond, our team of world-class engineers is undertaking research and development and pushing technology boundaries today that will support our competitiveness tomorrow.\nOver the past 2 years, we've invested over $2.1 billion in IRAD to maintain our technology leadership and for continuous innovation to disrupt the market and ourselves with the objective of maintaining long-term sustainable advantage for our war fighters and policymakers. As I mentioned earlier, we are exploring creative ways to bring solutions to market faster and focusing on priority areas such as the development and fielding of multifunction sensors, new and innovative ways to incorporate AI into our solutions and developing fielding new smarter weapon systems that bring unmatched superiority on the battlefield to name just a few.\nThe themes we are seeing in the U.S. are also true in the international market. Our allies are committed to modernizing their armed forces and investing in deterrent capabilities and the current geopolitical environment has increased the urgency for them to act now. This is being reflected in a significant increase in defense spending that is expected to carry well into the next decade. Allied Nations are prioritizing investments in air and missile defense, broad-based radars, airborne ISR and other advanced weapon systems to enhance their ability to deter and defend against conflict. This growing demand presents substantial opportunities for our company. and we are well positioned to deliver solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers worldwide. These factors contributed to our international sales growing 20% year-to-date.\nBefore I turn to 2026, let me address the U.S. government shutdown. It is unclear how long it might persist, but we are hopeful it will be resolved in the near term. Assuming it is, we do not anticipate any significant impact on our financial results. In the meantime, we remain focused on executing our programs and delivering on our commitments. Looking longer term, there continues to be strong bipartisan support for national security priorities with robust levels of investment provided through reconciliation and being considered for FY '26 appropriation. We believe this continued commitment to funding will result in a long tail of demand as resources are allocated and invested into the industrial base. Our confidence in these underlying trends reaffirms our outlook and positions us well for sustained growth.\nAs we look ahead to the new year, I'd like to take a moment to provide you with some color on how we're thinking about 2026. We expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth, supported by growth in all 4 of our segments. This top line growth will, in turn, enable us to also grow segment operating income. We expect the segment OM rate in the low to mid-11% range.\nLastly, as we look at cash, we are reaffirming our existing outlook range for 2026 free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion. I'd note that these estimates are not inclusive of a potential win on F/A-XX or an acceleration of the B-21 production rate. And as usual, we plan to provide formal guidance during our Q4 earnings call in January.\nSo in summary, I'd like to emphasize our unwavering commitment to our technology-focused business strategy, which continues to drive our profitable growth. We're experiencing an unprecedented demand environment, and our capital deployment strategy is enabling us to meet this demand and prepare us for opportunities in the future. As we move forward, our primary focus remains disciplined execution of our strategy and creating lasting value for both our customers and our shareholders.\nSo now let me hand it over to Ken to provide more details on the quarter's financial results.\n\nKenneth B. Crews\n\nCorporate Vice President & CFO\n\nThank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard from Kathy, we delivered another strong quarter of financial performance. Let's begin on Slide 4, which shows our top line results for the quarter. Third quarter sales were $10.4 billion, up 4% compared to the prior year and up 5% on an organic basis. We continue to expect further acceleration in Q4 with all segments returning to growth, both sequentially and on a year-over-year comparison.\nAeronautics generated third quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year. Higher sales were driven by the ramp of TACAMO and higher volume on F-35 program, partially offset by lower sales on F/A-18 as the program winds down. Sales at DS were exceptionally strong in Q3, accelerating to nearly $2.1 billion. Sales were higher across the DS portfolio, including on ammunition and weapons programs, IBCS and Sentinel. In total, DS sales grew by 14% compared to Q3 of last year and by 19% organically.\nMission Systems continues to deliver unmatched technological innovation at a rapid rate. This is reflected by further growth on restricted microelectronic programs in Q3, which led the segment to another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Sales were also higher at marine systems and on international programs, building on the strong momentum from the first half of the year.\nAnd at Space Systems, Q3 sales grew on a sequential basis again this quarter, rising to $2.7 billion. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down mid-single digits as expected and we have now nearly lapped the top line headwinds we've been experiencing on 2 programs for the past 18 months. Looking forward, we believe that Space is poised to return to growth given our positioning and opportunities in this arena.\nMoving to the bottom line on Slide 5. Operational performance was outstanding again in quarter 3. Segment operating income increased by 11% year-over-year, and our segment operating margin rate increased 80 basis points to 12.3%. AS operating income dollars were relatively flat compared to a year ago, and operating margin rate was 9.7%. This was driven by strong operating performance on mature production programs as well as lower net profitability adjustments. As we do every quarter, we review our estimate to complete the LRIP phase of the B-21 program, and made no significant changes to the previously recognized loss. However, we experienced higher-than-expected costs to produce the EMD flight test aircraft, which increased our estimate to manufacture the LRIP units. This increase was largely offset by a reduction in our expected loss on remaining LRIP lots due to a contract restructure that occurred during the quarter.\nTurning to DS. Quarter 3 margins improved to 11.4%, driven by strong operational performance and higher net favorable EAC adjustments. While the Q2 margin outperformance was driven by Sentinel, this quarter's strength was broad-based, with higher margin rates in each of the business areas. Mission Systems operating income increased 32% and their Q3 segment OM rate increased nearly 300 basis points to 16.7%. This performance was enabled by intentional steps this team has taken to drive efficiencies, mitigate risk and increase factory utilization, which drove a $68 million favorable EAC adjustment in the restricted advanced microelectronics portfolio. And Space Systems also had a solid quarter of operational performance, generating an operation margin rate of 11%.\nThese strong bottom line results drove higher earnings per share, as shown on Slide 6. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were $7.67, an increase of 10% compared to Q3 of 2024. In addition to strong segment results, mark-to-market gains on marketable securities increased by $0.35 compared to Q3 of last year. These benefits, along with higher net pension income were partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expenses and a higher federal tax rate, as previously disclosed.\nAs we reflect on our performance to date and expectations for Q4, we have a few updates to our company level guidance as shown on Slide 7. For sales, we are adjusting our outlook to a range of $41.7 billion to $41.9 billion, reflecting approximately 8% Q4 growth at the midpoint. We continue to expect a ramp in Q4 sales in all 4 segments, but at a slightly lower rate compared to our prior expectations. Importantly, we are maintaining our segment operating income dollar guidance range despite the lower sales volume. This results in a segment OM rate that is roughly 10 basis points higher than our prior guidance at the midpoint as a testament to the team's continued focus on disciplined program execution and driving efficiencies throughout the business.\nMoving to earnings per share. We are increasing our guidance by $0.65, now to a range of $25.65 to $26.05. The increase is driven by several factors. First, we are lowering our expectations for other corporate unallocated expenses to $250 million, a reduction of $30 million driven by lower unallowable cost. Secondly, we have slight revisions to our expectations for pension income and the effective tax rate, each providing a modest boost to EPS. And as I mentioned, we experienced a return on marketable securities in the quarter, which totaled roughly $80 million. Given market volatility, we have not assumed the entire Q3 gain in our full year guidance expectations.\nRounding out our company level guidance is cash flow. We are reaffirming our free cash flow expectations of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion. Third quarter free cash flow of $1.3 billion was well ahead of the past few years, and we continue to expect the largest quarter of cash generation in the fourth quarter, consistent with our seasonal pattern.\nIn addition, the unique factors driving year-end cash, as outlined during the Q2 call remain intact, including lower Q4 cash tax payments, higher milestone payments and inventory liquidations at AS. For the year, our guidance represents 22% annual free cash flow growth at the midpoint, making a third consecutive year of free cash flow growth greater than 20%.\nTurning to segment level guidance on Slide 8. We are reaffirming our top line guidance for DS and Space as they performed in line with our expectations in Q3, and we have not changed our view on their sales ramp in Q4. For Aeronautics, we are lowering top line guidance to the high $12 billion range. As we outlined on our Q2 earnings call, the second half ramp at AS is based on higher B-21 volume, ramp on new program wins, including TACAMO and normal production volume that is seasonally weighted towards the end of the year. And while all these factors remain intact, we are projecting a modestly lower sales level due to delayed timing on certain programs.\nIn addition, we are increasing our expectations for intercompany sales, driven by higher activity on restricted programs throughout the portfolio. These are partially offset by an increase to our sales guidance expectations at MS based on the strength of their year-to-date results and expectations for continued growth in Q4. As a result, we now expect MS sales in the mid-$12 billion range.\nWith respect to segment operating margin rates, we have 1 update this quarter related to DS. As I mentioned, they delivered another strong quarter of operational performance, and as a result, we are increasing the OM rate expectation to the high 10% range.\nBefore concluding my prepared remarks, I wanted to build on Kathy's comments regarding our 2026 outlook. First, sales growth next year is expected to be more balanced across each of the segments, with each contributing to growth. Secondly, operating income is expected to grow compared to 2025, and we don't anticipate a repeat of the large EAC adjustments we experienced this year on B-21, Sentinel and microelectronics. Adjusting for these items, our outlook for low to mid-11% margins would represent an increase compared to 2025.\nI'd also like to share our latest projections for 2026 net pension income based on current market conditions. As we typically do this time of year, we've included a 2026 pension income sensitivity grid on Slide 10. Year-to-date through September, asset returns were just north of 9%, slightly better than our initial expectations and discount rates were down 25 basis points. This combination will result in a modest increase to 2026 net pension income compared to our prior projections, depending on where we end the year. Importantly, our pension plans remain fully funded, and we continue to project minimal cash contributions over the next several years.\nSo in conclusion, we believe we are well positioned for a broad range of new opportunities. We remain focused on growing our business, delivering strong operational performance and generating cash flows that allow us to execute our business strategy.\nWith that, let's open the call for Q&A."

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2025 Conference Call.\nBefore we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlook for 2025 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In addition, we will refer to a presentation that is posted to our Investor Relations website.\nOn the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Ken Crews, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's earnings release, we delivered a strong second quarter. The breadth and depth of our company's portfolio and our ability to respond with speed to our customers' needs continues to drive robust growth as evidenced by our strong backlog. In addition, our revenue increased 9% compared to the first quarter with higher sequential sales in all 4 segments.\nThe team also delivered outstanding operating performance this quarter as demonstrated by an 11.8% segment operating margin. As we look towards the second half of the year, we expect continued ramp on franchise programs and normal operational seasonality to support accelerating growth. We also expect segment margins to remain strong consistent with our first half performance, excluding the B-21 charge, and this is driven by performance, favorable mix and international growth.\nBased on the strength of our second quarter results and confidence in our second half outlook, we are increasing our guidance for segment operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The U.S. and our allies are making significant investments in defense capabilities, and we continue to see growing demand and opportunity for our broad range of product offerings. Whether in the space, air, land, fiber or undersea domain, our technologies and our ability to integrate hardware and software for Mission Solutions are core to what customers need today. Domestically, these investments in defense are highlighted by the recently enacted reconciliation bill and FY '26 budget request, which represents a combined 22% increase in procurement and RDT&E over fiscal year 2025. This includes investments in Northrop Grumman programs and new potential growth areas. And the demand acceleration for our products extends outside the United States.\nIn the second quarter, our international sales grew by 18% year-over-year and are up 14% year-to-date. We have a strong international book-to-bill for aircraft, weapons, missile defense and airborne systems. In Europe, we see significant opportunities for IBCS and weapon systems. And in the Middle East, where I joined the President in May, there are several multibillion dollar opportunities in integrated air and missile defense, munitions, AARGM-ER and ground-based radars. As part of our international strategy, we have extensive partnerships to support local industrial-based growth.\nWith a commitment to continue innovating and investing in capacity and a strong global demand signal from our customers, we are confident in our long-range potential growth. One area of expected growth that I'll highlight today is air and missile defense. With products such as IBCS and GPI, we're positioned as a key capability provider for missile defense to customers around the globe. And as we look to Golden Dome for America, we see Northrop Grumman playing a crucial role in supporting the administration's goal to move with speed and have initial operating capability in place within the next few years.\nThis includes current products that can be brought to bear, like IBCS, GATR, TRITON and programs in a restricted portfolio, just to name a few. It will also include new innovations, like space-based interceptors, which we're testing now. We have the ability to work across the entire architecture, and we bring the scale, innovation and research and development expertise that we can apply to each layer of this critical homeland defense initiative.\nGolden Dome is just one example of how the administration is pushing for differentiating capabilities at speed and scale to achieve piece through strength. Importantly, they've recognized the need to remove barriers for industry and government that prevent us from moving faster. We are already seeing the benefits of this to include our work on Sentinel and B-21.\nOn Sentinel, we made significant progress on the program restructuring in the second quarter. In close partnership with the Air Force, we reached agreement on a restructured approach, which will lead to reestablishment of the program baseline. The work suspension on most aspects of the command and launch portion of the program was lifted, and we've resumed work on launch facility requirements in design. We continue to ramp on the program and make progress through development, testing and risk reduction activities.\nOur second quarter results include strong sentinel growth as well as a positive earnings adjustment reflecting the agreements we reached with our customer and improved confidence in achieving various performance incentives. We expect Sentinel revenue momentum to continue and for the program to be a meaningful contributor to our growth in the second half of the year. In partnership with the Department of Defense, we continue to work on acceleration options for the program, and we're confident in our ability to execute all faces of the program and deliver this critical capability for our nation.\nOn the B-21 program, it continues to be well supported by the Defense Department and Congress and the value and importance of a stealth strategic bomber was certainly shown with operations midnight hammer. The Air Force has recently confirmed it is committed to the successful fielding of the B-21 and is investing in the infrastructure necessary to support an increased yearly production capacity. Through reconciliation, the B-21 received an additional $4.5 billion to increase production capacity. This builds on the efforts that we and the Air Force has made previously to prepare for a more rapid production ramp.\nWe are in discussions with the Air Force regarding the potential for an accelerated production ramp on the program. And while the ultimate outcome of these discussions remain uncertain, we currently expect any agreement to accelerate production ramp would require further investment by the company to expand production capacity, along with the opportunity to earn improved return on the LRIP and NTE production lots.\nWith the pace of change in advancements in technology, coupled with our customers push for speed, we are constantly working to introduce new technologies and concepts to address our customers' needs. Beacon, which is highlighted on the cover of our slide deck is one example of how we approach this. With Beacon, which we revealed in the second quarter, we've taken decades of autonomy experience and 500,000 autonomous flight hours to create a flying mission test bed.\nWe bring software from companies of all sizes together with our flight software and hardware. Beacon will accelerate autonomous mission capabilities for our customers by allowing a variety of industry partners to move faster because of the work Northrop has done and is doing on autonomy. Our investment in Beacon also supports the administration's call for more next-generation autonomous system.\nBefore wrapping my remarks, I want to highlight the importance of our strategy to invest in the business. Speed of bringing technology to market is important in this environment, and capacity is an important enabler to rapidly fielding capability. The capital investments we've made and that we continue to make allow us to meet this demand from our customers, remain competitive and lay the groundwork for our future growth.\nIn the area of solid rocket motors, we have invested $1 billion over the past 6 years, significantly improving our capacity and flexibility across multiple facilities. This includes investments at the Alleghany Ballistic laboratory facility in West Virginia for small motors, and in Elkton, Maryland for medium-sized and hypersonic motors, both of which support growth in our tactical weapons business at DS.\nAs a result of this investment, we were recently selected by the U.S. Navy to provide the 21-inch second stage solid rocket motor for its extended range missile programs. We developed and demonstrated this capability in less than a year.\nIn the Space segment, our investments at the Bacus facility for large rocket motors support the build-out of the Kiper satellite constellation. Overall, we expect to increase our total annual solid rocket motor production rate from 13,000 units today to 25,000 by 2029. We will continue to make strategic investments in our business to ensure we have the scale and capabilities needed to support our customers effectively. This includes emerging missile defense opportunities such as Golden Dome for America and second-source qualification for several tactical missiles.\nAt the same time, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This includes returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this year. We repurchased nearly $900 million in stock in the first half of the year. And in the second quarter, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend, marking our 22nd consecutive annual increase. This increase is supported by the strong growth in free cash flow at the company.\nReflecting our focus on delivering long-term value to shareholders over the past 10 years, we've increased our dividend at approximately 11% compounded annual growth rate.\nIn summary, I'd like to thank our team for an excellent quarter. We have an outstanding portfolio, robust global demand and funding environment that supports it and a high-performing team. This all leads to a strong outlook for our company.\nI'll now turn to Ken to share more details on our second quarter financial results and our outlook. Ken?\n\nKenneth B. Crews\n\nCorporate Vice President & CFO\n\nThank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comment with top line results for the quarter. As shown on Slide 4 in the earnings deck, second quarter sales were $10.4 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Sequentially, Q2 sales were up 9% compared to Q1, with all segments contributing to this meaningful growth. And organic sales were $10.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting the divestiture of the training services business, which closed ahead of schedule at the end of May. .\nAeronautics second quarter sales increased by 2% year-over-year due to higher volume on B-21 and Tacoma, partially offset by lower restricted sales. At DS, sales grew by 7% on a GAAP basis driven by the Sentinel program and from higher ammunition sales. The training services business generated $40 million of sales in Q2 before the transaction closed. So on an organic basis, DS sales increased 9% compared to the prior year.\nMission Systems was our fastest-growing segment in Q2, with sales up by 14% year-over-year. This was driven in part by liquidation of inventory on a restricted award received in the period, which we had originally expected in Q1 and higher volume on marine programs. And at Space, Q2 sales were lower, primarily due to the previously communicated wind down of work on 2 programs, reflecting $283 million of year-over-year headwinds.\nTurning to Slide 5. Operational performance for the quarter was strong. Segment operating income was higher by 11% compared to Q2 of last year, and our segment operating margin rate increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 11.8%. AS operating income was up 3% compared to the prior year, with a Q2 operating margin rate of 10.3%. This portfolio continues to have a mix of mature production programs and newer development programs. And coupled with strong program execution and disciplined cost management, it provides a formula for AS to deliver healthy margin rates. Defense Systems had a standout quarter of margin performance, with a quarter 2 margin rate improving to 12.7%. This performance was driven by the recognition of a favorable EAC adjustment on the EMD phase of the SIM program, primarily based on expectations for achieving certain contract incentives.\nAt Mission Systems, second quarter margins expanded to 14% and operating income increased 22% year-over-year. This quarter's margin reflects improved production efficiencies and performance across airborne radar programs.\nAnd at Space Systems, operating income dollars were reflective of the lower sales volume, partially offset by improved program performance. Operating margin rate was 10.6%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. driven by higher net EAC adjustments.\nMoving to earnings per share. Slide 6 shows year-over-year EPS comparison. In total, second quarter diluted earnings per share was $8.15, an increase of 28% compared to the second quarter of 2024. This was driven by 2 factors: Higher sales and improved segment performance, which contributed $0.80 of year-over-year benefit; and a gain of $1.04 recognized on the divestiture of the training services business.\nNext, I'll provide updates on our forward outlook, starting with segment level guidance on Slide 7. For sales, we are maintaining our top line outlook at ASDS a low $13 billion and low $8 billion, respectively. Aeronautics sales reflect mid-single-digit annual growth driven by the continued ramp on B-21 as well as higher volume on F-35 and B2. We continue to expect DS will achieve double-digit sales growth this year, driven by Sentinel, IBCS and higher volume in our weapons business, stemming from 2024 award volume.\nAt Mission Systems, we are increasing our sales expectations to low to mid-$12 billion, based on the strength of their year-to-date results and continued growth on domestic and international programs throughout their portfolio, including Armor and ground-based radar, EW and restricted programs.\nAnd at Space, we now project sales of mid- to high $10 billion, reflective of the award decision on the ESS program.\nWith respect to operating margin rate, we are maintaining our margin rate expectations for AF, MS and space. At DS, we are increasing our margin rate expectations to mid-10% based on their notable Q2 results.\nAt the company level, as shown on Slide 8, we are narrowing the range on our top line outlook and expect organic sales growth of approximately 3% for the year. This outlook projects sales in the second half of the year to be higher than in the first half by approximately $2.5 billion. This increase in revenue is driven by a few factors. First, we expect the TRIAD programs on B-21, Sentinel and Colombia to collectively deliver roughly $750 million in higher second half sales.\nB-21 LRIP Block 3 and Block 5 advanced procurement are expected to be awarded in Q4. These awards will also include a significant amount of revenue recognition due to inventory liquidations for materials purchased to support production schedules. Meanwhile, the Signal and Colombia programs are expected to continue to ramp, including higher material receipts and subcontractor deliveries in the second half of the year.\nAnother element of second half growth is the ramp on new recently awarded programs, including Tacoma, IBCS, international ground-based radars and multiple ammunition programs. Collectively, these new programs are expected to contribute nearly $700 million of higher second half sales.\nAnd lastly, Q4 has historically been our strongest quarter of revenue generation driven by production schedules and timing of materials. We expect this normal seasonality to continue this year, contributing roughly $1 billion of higher second half sales. Altogether, we expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% compared to Q2 with further acceleration in Q4, positioning us to deliver on our full year sales guidance.\nFor segment operating income, we are increasing the guidance range by $50 million at the midpoint driven by higher margins at DS that I previously described. This reflects the company-level segment OM rate of almost 11.4% in the second half. I'd reemphasize that excluding the B-21 EAC adjustment in Q1, first half margins were also 11.4%.\nMS is expected to be the driver of margin dollar growth in the second half. The MS profile is enabled by continued strong program performance, higher international sales and seasonal volume increases to higher-margin production programs later in the year.\nWith respect to earnings per share, we are increasing our guidance range driven by higher segment operating income. This increase in operational performance is being partially offset by nonoperational items. While the reconciliation bill recently signed into law includes several provisions that benefit cash flow, it also modifies the treatment of certain R&D tax credits that increased our estimated tax rate. As a result, we now expect a tax rate of high 17% for the year.\nGiven the bill was approved in July, we expect an effective Q3 tax rate of approximately 21% to reflect the cumulative impact to date. We are reaffirming our guidance for corporate unallocated expenses and expect roughly $100 million of expense in both Q3 and Q4 due to timing of safe taxes and normal seasonality. Taking all those elements into account, we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect a range of $25 to $25.40.\nLastly, with respect to cash, we are increasing our 2025 guidance range and now expect free cash flow of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion. This increase is driven by the revision to Section 174 in the tax code related to treatment of R&D expenditures, partially offset by the application of the corporate minimum tax. In the quarter, we generated $637 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement compared to the first quarter. We continue to expect the largest quarter of cash generation in the fourth quarter, consistent with our seasonal pattern and sales ramp.\nIn addition, there are a few other unique items driving higher Q4 cash flows. First, as previously noted, reduced cash tax payments this year; second, we have a higher-than-average level of milestone payments in the second half, including contract close-out payments at space. And lastly, we expect a significant benefit from inventory liquidations, particularly in aeronautics in Q4.\nIn summary, we had an outstanding quarter of operational and financial performance. Sales, margins, earnings per share and cash all increased meaningfully from Q1 with momentum that we expect to continue in the second half of the year. These results demonstrate the value of the Northrop Grumman portfolio as well as our continued focus on disciplined program performance. We remain focused on delivering on our full year commitments while executing our business strategy and deploying our capital in value-creating ways.\nWith that, we'll open the call to questions."

This call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Tod Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Before we start today, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2025 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In addition, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our Investor Relations website.\nOn the call today are Kathy Warden, our CEO and President; and Ken Crews, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings conference call. A lot has happened since our last call in January, so we're looking forward to providing you an update on the quarter and our expectations for the year.\nWe are operating in a rapidly evolving world, and we are managing through a dynamic U.S. defense budget environment, with the first of its kind full year continuing resolution. In this environment, we continue to see strong demand signals from our global customers, resulting in another good backlog in the first quarter of $92.8 billion, and that's inclusive of strong international bookings. As we indicated in mid-February, we've experienced delays in certain awards, which resulted in a slower sales ramp in the first quarter than we previously anticipated. We expect this to improve throughout the year.\nMargin rates setting aside the B-21 adjustment were expectations. We have updated our 2025 financial guidance, and we are our outlook for sales and free cash flow. With a growing backlog and progress on award timing, we have confidence in achieving our outlook and remain on delivering transformative capabilities for our customers.\nI'd like to take a minute to discuss the B-21 profit adjustment made in the quarter. As you saw in the earnings release, we recognized an additional [ $477 ] million pretax loss. This is relating to higher manufacturing costs, primarily resulting from a process change, we may enable higher production rates as well as increases in the projected material costs, some of which are related to macroeconomic material prices. While I'm disappointed with this financial impact, we continue to make solid progress on the program, demonstrating performance object retest and we are progressing through the first two\nWith significant learning behind us, we are ready to deliver the Air Force is highly capable strategic deterrent. During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on other key programs as well. On Sentinel, the U.S. Air Force and Northrop Grumman completed a successful static fire test of the Stage 1 solid rocket motor for the missile in March. This critical milestone for the system further validates the motors design and paves the way for the production and deployment of a safe, secure and reliable deterrent. We are also continuing to work with the customer to identify cost and schedule efficiencies as they evaluate requirements to balance capability, affordability and schedule for the program.\nIn January, the U.S. Army awarded us a [ $1 ] million contract for IBCS. Under this award, Northrop Grumman will expand software development and include additional AI and model-based systems engineering capabilities to allow more rapid integration for the Army and our international partners. Earlier this month, we announced the opening of a state-of-the-art production and integration facility in Alabama to support accelerated modernization plan for Air and Missile Defense Systems in IBCS.\nWith this investment, it doubles the of the previous footprint, leverages Northrop Grumman digital ecosystem and gives us the ability to scale production and field new capabilities speed. Also, we received a nearly $300 million in awards in the first quarter from the U.S. Navy to produce 2 additional Triton aircraft and associated support services. We are also in progress on delivering trite to Australia. The first of 4 was delivered last year and the second and third aircraft have completed testing with the U.S. Navy prior to delivery to the Royal and Air Force this year.\nTriton is playing a critical role surveilling high-priority areas of interest in multiple regions. And it was just announced last week that Triton will soon be deployed Southern Japan to commence surveillance and information gathering operations.\nI'd like to take the next few minutes to our view of the market outlook for both the industry in general and Northrop Grumman more For our industry, demand ultimately stems from the global threat environment. Over the past decade, this environment has grown increasingly complex with the reemergence making the pace of innovation and production crucial for deterrence. As a result, our global customers are increasing their investments in national security.\nIn the U.S., we continue to see signs that defense spending will increase, driven by a few owing developments. The first is finalization of a continuing resolution for the 2025 defense budget. This CR comes with several provisions that set it apart from previous ones. The most notable of an increase in the top line over FY '24 and increased flex for the spending account. Meanwhile, there is a potential for additional funding through the reconciliation process, which could add up to $150 billion to the defense budget to be allocated over multiple years. Both the House and the Senate have passed initial legislation that lays the groundwork for this additional funding. We believe much of this will be used to support investments to maintain our nation's edge against evolving global threats.\nLastly, the administration continues to prepare their fiscal year 2026 budget request, and we are encouraged by recent commentary that suggests a continued strong commitment to national security funding at levels higher than prior projections. The administration has highlighted key priority areas such as the Triad missile defense and weapon systems, all of which are aligned the core capabilities of Northrop Grumman.\nAdditionally, the significant increase in defense investment outside the U.S. is leading to a growing pipeline of quest for our products across Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East as countries seek to protect their sovereign territories and\nIn Q1, our international sales represented approximately 14% of total We have broadened our customer base, increased the number of products that we can sell internationally and establish new partnerships globally to enhance our addressable market. As a result, we continue to see opportunities to increase our international sales over the coming years, and we are making steady progress in this area, with a first quarter international book-to-bill of 1.45x and international sales up 11% in the quarter. International bookings were driven in part by over $1 billion in international awards at Mission Systems. Also in the quarter, Poland signed a $745 million letter of acceptance 200 RME missiles, adding to the growth potential for our Defense Systems business.\nWe continue to see a broad pipeline of opportunities in the areas of air and missile defense, airborne ISR and C2 systems and ammunition across multiple markets, including newly emerging opportunities in the Middle East. Our strategy is to compete and win in global markets through technology differentiation, bringing innovation and capability beyond what commercial alternatives can provide. To further our ability to innovate and deliver, we invested $13.5 billion in R&D and infrastructure over the last 5 years. As a result, we now have the ability to scale, design and produce while fielding new capabilities at speed.\nWe also have a track record of delivering defense technology that stays ahead of the pacing threats. For example, our technology is inside 90% of U.S. national security space satellites. We're a leader in low observable technology, having produced the first Stealth the B2 and now its successor, the B-21. We've delivered more than 1.3 million solid rocket motors, and we are a leader in Vision Systems where we produce over 1 million secure microchips per year some of which are 1,000x faster microchips in your smartphone. So as we look to the future, we are leveraging our own hardware and software capabilities to develop the next generation of systems, and we're also partnering companies in areas such as AI to ensure our customers have the most advanced capabilities in the world.\nIn conclusion, given our key franchise program record backlog, strong competitive position and global market dynamics, we continue to project significant potential ahead. Our focus remains on our strategy of driving innovation, expanding our market presence and optimizing performance to deliver profitable, sustainable growth. We are committed to our long-term vision of creating value for our shareholders, meeting our customer needs and staying ahead in an ever-evolving global market landscape.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Ken to discuss our first quarter results and our updated guidance. Ken?\n\nKenneth B. Crews\n\nCorporate Vice President & CFO\n\nThank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our top line results on Slide 4 in our earnings deck. First quarter sales were $9.5 billion, down 7% compared to the prior year, and included 2 less working days compared to Q1 2024. Sales in the quarter were also impacted by multiple contracting delays and timing of material receipts. This sales profile was contemplated in our expectations that we shared in February. However, as Kathy outlined, we updated our estimates to complete the LRIP phase of the B-21 program late in the quarter, which lowered sales by nearly $100 million. As a result, Q1 sales were slightly below our expectations. However, we are still on the path to achieve our full year sales guidance.\nIn total, Aeronautic sales were down 8% year-over-year due to lower B-21 sales and timing of production and material on mature program, including F-35. DS first quarter sales increased by $68 million or 4%, primarily due to the continued ramp on the Sentinel program and higher volume on certain military ammunition programs. Mission Systems sales continued to expand up $148 million, driven by numerous programs throughout their portfolio. Higher sales on Sabre, EW, international ground-based radar and marine programs all contributed to the 6% growth. And space sales were lower primarily due to the previously communicated wind down of work on 2 programs, which totaled approximately $230 million of year-over-year headwinds, as well as from lower volume on CRS and FDA satellite brands.\nMoving to the bottom line. Our first quarter segment operating income results going on to Slide 5. As previously discussed, AS adjusted their estimate to complete the phase of the B-21 program, loss provision was $477 million across the 5 LRIP lots, which had the effect of lowering our company Q1 segment operating margin rate to 6%. At DS, first quarter 2025 segment operating income grew by 15% and their margin rate improved to 9.9%. This improvement was driven by higher volume, improved performance and an increased net favorable EACs. At Mission Systems, Quarter 1 operating margin decreased 4% due to lower volume on certain fixed price restricted production programs and investments made in connection with restricted business opportunities. These reductions were partially offset by higher net EAC adjustments.\nIn that space, first quarter segment operating income was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by improved program performance. Notably, Space's net favorable EACs improved to $29 million in Q1, leading to an 11% operating margin rate. Outside of the B-21 adjustment, segment operating income was consistent with the first quarter of 2024, and net favorable EACs were higher by over 30% year-over-year. This performance is driven by disciplined program execution and our focus on driving cost efficiencies in our business.\nMoving to year-over-year EPS comparing to Slide 6. Earnings per share were lower primarily due to the adjustment on B-21, which totaled $2.74 per share on an after-tax basis. Lower sales volume and as expected, higher corporate unallocated expense also contributed to the combined $0.25 of year-over-year headwind.\nBefore covering our updated guidance for 2025, I want to take a moment to talk about Q1 cash flow. Consistent with our seasonal pattern and expectations, first quarter results reflected a usage of cash, operating cash outflow of $1.5 billion reflected an increase in vendor payments as well as lower billings and collections compared to our prior year. We also invested nearly $300 million in capital expenditures during the period. We continue to expect cash flow to gradually ramp throughout the year with the largest quarter of cash generation in Q4, consistent with our historical performance. And from a capital deployment perspective, we repaid $1.5 billion of notes that matured in January, as we indicated on our Q4 earnings call. We also returned nearly $800 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nTurning to company guidance on Slide 7. We continue to expect $42 billion to $42.5 billion in 2025 sales, representing 3% to 4% organic growth. Looking forward, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth in Q2, followed by sales ramp in the second half of the year, driven by awards booked in Q4 2024, the timing of subcontractor deliveries and material receipts as well as from new program awards.\nWith respect to evolving trade policy, the vast majority of our supply chain is sourced from domestic suppliers. After a thorough review of our supply chain, we have a good understanding of the risk areas and are taking mitigation actions where possible to address them. Full year segment operating income and EPS guidance have been updated to reflect the B-21 adjustment, which also had the effect of lowering our estimated tax rate for the year to high 16%. And we are reaffirming our 2025 free cash flow guidance range of $2.85 billion to $3.25 billion.\nAt the segment level, we are reaffirming our sales expectation at each of our segments. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth at AS and MS driven by continued ramp on B-21, and multiple programs across our diverse MS portfolio. We expect DS will achieve double-digit organic sales growth this year, driven by IBCS backlog, Sentinel and higher volume in our weapons business. The divestiture of the training service business is on track to close midyear, assume early Q3 for your modeling purposes, and we continue to project space sales of roughly $11 billion, enabled by new production on existing programs and new competitive wins in the restricted domain.\nWe have updated our OM rate expectations at AS and now expect an OM rate of low to mid 6%. We are reaffirming our margin rate expectations for the other segments and with each projected to increase from 2024 actual results. We expect a gradual ramp in segment margin rates over the coming quarters driven by EMS. This profile is enabled by continued strong program performance, execution of cost-saving initiatives and seasonal volume shift to higher-margin production programs later in the year.\nTo conclude, our portfolio is well aligned to customer priorities, and we will continue to drive efficiencies, manage risk and elevate performance, deliver profitable growth over the long term. This will enable us to execute our capital deployment strategy, which prioritizes investing in innovation and capacity to meet our customer needs while returning cash to shareholders.\nWith that, we are ready to begin Q&A."

My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Before we start, due to technical issues with our provider, we have provided a new dial-in information for the analysts. So please use that to dial into the call. Moving on, matters discussed today on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2025 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. At Northrop Grumman, we remain steadfast in our mission to innovate and deliver cutting-edge technologies that enhance national security for the U.S. and our allies. We are harnessing our investments to manufacture at scale, the integrated hardware and software solutions that give our customers an advantage. Our strategy, which is based on technology differentiation, has resulted in another year of strong financial performance. We set a new record backlog, including significant new competitive wins and follow-on awards.\nWe ended the year with a backlog of approximately $91.5 billion and a book-to-bill ratio at 1.23x, providing a solid foundation for future growth. This was driven in part by a new competitive win on the Tacoma program, an award for the second [ Lot ] on B-21 in the fourth quarter. Over the past 3 years, our book-to-bill is 1.15x. Reflecting strong ongoing demand for our capabilities across U.S. and international markets. In the fourth quarter, we also booked $900 million for the next iteration of Poland's IBCS system. Bringing our international book-to-bill ratio for the year to 1.4x.\nGiven this strong demand, we now expect our international business to accelerate and grow faster than U.S. sales in 2025. Our proven ability to grow backlog and deliver key capabilities to our customers has led to another year of strong top line growth with 2024 sales up more than 4% and building on the momentum over the last 5 years, where our top line has grown by 30% organically. Meanwhile, our focus on performance and driving efficiencies in our business is leading to margin expansion. With segment operating margin dollars growing faster than sales. And our free cash flow performance for the year was outstanding, increasing 25% year-over-year to over $2.6 billion at the high end of our guidance range. As we look forward, our guidance reflects our expectation for continued solid organic growth of 3% to 4% and further segment margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth again in 2025.\nThis guidance is consistent with the outlook we provided to you in October. At Northrop Grumman, our portfolio is well positioned to provide critical deterrence capabilities and differentiating technology that address peer threats and achieve the shared goals of equipping the world's greatest military reaching new frontiers and space and improving the way industry and government do business.\nWe look forward to partnering with the Trump administration to accomplish these objectives. We expect Congress to complete FY '25 appropriations this spring, which is assumed in our guidance. As discussions continue regarding the U.S. defense budget and potential additional investments, we continue to see strong bipartisan support for national security. And global defense budgets are growing as our allies seek to counter aggressive from aggression from increasingly sophisticated threats. This is driving an increase in demand, particularly in areas such as crude and on crude aircraft, advanced weapons and missile defense. These dynamics give us confidence in our strong international growth outlook.\nAt our core, we are a technology company, and we are well positioned on programs that are essential to the U.S. and our allies national security. More than just an integrator, we possess technology depth throughout Northrop Grumman, not only in what we produce, but in how we produce it. This combination allows us to compete and win on priority programs and support our customers' goals of peace through strength. One example is our government trusted design and development to specialized microelectronics for the Department of Defense through our accredited foundries. In our Microelectronics Center, we build on our path to innovate for [ future ]. And continually disrupt our own technology to bring unmatched capabilities to the U.S. military. Our Terahertz Microchip, which operates at 1 trillion cycles per second is the fastest in the world according to the Guinness World Record. This type of innovation is realized through material science, new hardware design and manufacturing techniques and advanced software development. all capabilities that we have built and refined over time and possess at scale so we can deliver for our customers' most challenging missions.\nAs a result of having this capability, our microelectronics business grew over 20% in 2024. And equally important, it creates competitive advantages for Northrop Grumman by providing mission-critical technologies that flow upwards through our value chain, are married with missionize software and then are designed into product areas such as sensors, communications, processing and security solutions. We delivered these game-changing capabilities as a prime contractor on platforms we build and also offer them as a trusted supplier to other platform manufacturers. As technological change accelerates, it becomes more important that we continue to deliver technology discriminators, whether that's time together capabilities for family of system solutions or developing additional use cases for our missionized AI and enhance our solutions or accelerate decision-making.\nWe are leveraging our own hardware and software and also partnering with leading companies in areas such as AI to ensure our customers have the most advanced equipment in the world. Innovation and having the capabilities to meet our customer needs are important, but the ability to scale production and field new systems at speed are core to ultimate mission success. As we've grown our capacity, we've also been implementing advanced manufacturing techniques, automation and digital factories across our company. We are designing manufacturing and sustaining our next-generation systems with digital ecosystems that are improving our agility and efficiency and therefore, lowering our costs and time to field. These new manufacturing technologies, along with the capacity investments we've made enable us to rapidly ramp production. We've done this in areas like solid rocket motors, advanced weapons and satellite manufacturing. And these investments also allow us to more seamlessly transition major programs from design to production, like we've done with the B-21. All of which have been and will continue to be important drivers of growth for our company.\nNext, I'd like to update you on the plans we've previously shared to drive margin expansion. We continue to expect favorable mix to be a driver as we ramp on production programs and grow our international sales over the next several years. Beyond this, we are taking proactive actions to drive efficiencies across the company. These actions include implementation of digital tool sets that reduce process time, automate tasks and maximize output for our technical team. We're streamlining our organizational structure optimizing our supply chain spend and reducing costs through improved utilization of our resources and facilities. We removed over $200 million of cost in the enterprise in 2024 alone. We have a laser focus on performance excellence, driven by delivering first-time quality and robust risk management processes.\nAltogether, these cost efficiency initiatives, mix shifts, and focus on performance, give us confidence we can reduce cost to the taxpayer while also enhancing segment margins as we progress through this decade. This margin expansion, coupled with continued growth in our business and reduced capital investment are the drivers of our roto-year free cash flow growth outlook. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy that supports our customers' requirements and returns cash to shareholders. Over the past 2 years, we've invested over $3.5 billion in CapEx to expand our capacity and implement the advanced manufacturing lines across our company. And we are planning to invest another $1.5 billion in 2025.\nWe've also delivered over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders last year. We continue to believe we have the best portfolio that is aligned to our customers' highest priority missions. However, as we always do, we continuously evaluate the portfolio to ensure that we are investing in the businesses that are core to achieving our strategic vision. This includes accessing any gaps that may emerge over time or businesses that may make sense to active. With this in mind, we've decided to exit our training services business that is part of Defense Systems segment. Today, we announced that we have signed an agreement to sell the business to Circo Inc. for $327 million, and we forecast this transaction to close towards the middle of the year. This is an important capability for our customers, and we expect the team to continue to deliver world-class training services under new leadership, allowing us to focus on our core business.\n2024 was marked by strong program execution, compelling financial performance, implementation of operational improvements and impactful strategic initiatives that have positioned us for long-term success. Our ability to capitalize on opportunities and deliver exceptional results is a direct testament to the hard work and dedication of every member of our company. Our strategic priorities remain focused on fostering innovation, enhancing operational excellence and expanding our impact for our customers.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our 2025 guidance. Ken?\n\nKenneth B. Crews\n\nCorporate Vice President & CFO\n\nThank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy outlined, we delivered another strong year of financial performance in 2024, delivering on or exceeding the financial commitments that we communicated a year ago. This sustained performance is a reflection of our strategic positioning, continued focus on operational excellence and disciplined approach to financial management. We continue to see robust and enduring demand for our capabilities in both domestic and international markets. Reflecting this demand, we booked $17.3 billion in new awards in the fourth quarter and approximately $51 billion for the full year.\nThis led to a record backlog of over $91 billion, an increase of 9% compared to last year, positioning the company for continued growth. Moving to top line. We generated sales of $10.7 billion in quarter 4 and $41 billion for the year. 2024 sales increased by 4.4%, with growth across 3 of our 4 businesses. Transitioning to segment performance. NGAS grew to $12 billion in 2024, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Sales volume increased throughout the portfolio and was driven by the production ramp on B-21 and from higher activity on the F-35 program. Sales were also higher on autonomous programs such as Triton and Global Hawk. And we saw higher volume on E2 sustainment and modernization work. DS posted sales growth of 3%, driven by higher sales on Sentinel, advanced weapons and ammunition programs. partially offset by lower volume due to the completion of an international training program.\nMission Systems sales increased by 5%, led by higher volume on advanced and microelectronics and technology programs. And in the Space segment, 2024 sales were down modestly as expected compared to the prior year due to the wind down of a restrictive program and NGAD. As we previously stated, the remaining space portfolio grew at mid-single digits in 2024, driven by higher sales on Space Development Agency satellite programs and numerous other programs. Turning to the bottom line. 2024 segment operating income was over $4.5 billion, and our segment operating margin rate expanded to 11.1%. Margins improved due to the proactive steps we've taken to further enhance performance and drive efficiencies across our business, as Kathy described earlier in the call. This performance led to an increase in net favorable earnings adjustments totaling $350 million for the year. Strong segment performance was the driver for higher year-over-year earnings per share, as shown on Slide 6 in our earnings deck. 2024 mark-to-market adjusted EPS was $26.08 and exceeded the high end of our guidance range provided in October. Higher net pension income and a lower share count also provided an uplift.\nMoving to cash. We had an excellent quarter of cash generation in Q4, as is our historical pattern. Our full year operating cash flow was $4.4 billion, and we invested roughly $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. This resulted in over $2.6 billion in 2024 free cash flow, near the high end of our guidance range and up a notable 25% compared to 2023. Next, I would like to provide an update on our pension results and multiyear estimates. Asset returns in 2024 were 4.7%, below our long-term expected rate of return of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the FAS discount rate increased by roughly 60 basis points to 5.73%. More than offsetting the impact from lower asset returns. The net result, along with updated census data is a 2024 mark-to-market after-tax benefit of $332 million or $2.26 a share.\nLooking forward, these results translate to slightly higher expected CAS recoveries and a reduced FAS pension benefit lowering overall net pension income compared to the prior outlook. Importantly, our pension plans remain fully funded, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Before covering our 2025 guidance, I'll highlight recent changes to our portfolio. In addition to the upcoming divestiture of the training services business, which has an annual run rate of $300 million in sales, the strike and surveillance aircraft services business unit has been realigned from defense systems to aeronautic systems. Effective January 1 of this year.\nThis business provides a variety of support and sustainment activities primarily on aircraft programs in our AS portfolio. This now aligns the full product life cycles of Northrop Grumman aircraft allowing for more seamless development and sustainment of next-generation aircraft. These actions, coupled with the completion of an international training program, create a portfolio at DS that is now centered around strategic deterrents, advanced weapons and missile defense. Fourth quarter and 2024 results have been reported in the prior organization structure and we've provided a few tables in our earnings release and slide deck that recast sales and margins for current and historical periods. Moving forward, we'll report first quarter 2025 results and beyond in the new structure. And our 2025 segment guidance also reflects the new structure inclusive of the divestiture.\nTurning to 2025. Our segment guidance is included on Slide 8 in our earnings deck. Aeronautic sales are expected to be in below $13 billion, representing mid-single-digit growth. This includes nearly $400 million of sales from the realignment previously mentioned. Aeronautics margins are expected in the mid- to high 9% range and reflect higher sales on the LRIP phase of B-21. 2025 DSLs are projected in the low $8 billion. We expect DS to be our fastest-growing business in 2025 with double-digit organic sales growth, driven by higher sales on Sentinel, IBCS and our diverse weapons portfolio. Segment operating margin at DS is expected to grow faster than sales with an OM rate of mid- to high 9%.\nSales at Mission Systems are projected to grow mid-single digits again in 2025, with sales reaching approximately $12 billion. and operating margins are expected to expand approximately 50 basis points to mid-14%, as productivity initiatives continue to drive improved performance. We expect sales in the space segment of roughly $11 billion, reflecting a year-over-year headwind of $900 million from the wind down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs. And we expect an OM rate of high 10% at space ahead of where we ended 2024. At the company level, our 2025 guidance is consistent with the outlook we provided on our Q3 call. Full year sales are expected to grow 3% to 4% on an organic basis with first quarter sales and margins comparable to Q1 of last year.\nKeep in mind, the first quarter year-over-year company sales growth will be flat due to the program wind-downs in space with the majority of the year-over-year growth occurring in the second half of the year. Full year segment margins are projected to expand roughly 10 basis points with margins also ramping throughout the year. This year-over-year expansion is driven by the continuation of our efficiency and productivity initiatives as well as international growth. Our guidance for mark-to-market adjusted EPS is $28.5 at the midpoint, up more than 7% year-over-year. Next, I want to take a moment to highlight several contributing factors to this outlook. First, the total fab CAS pension adjustment is projected at $800 million, down $60 million compared to our prior outlook in Q3. Second, we are projecting corporate unallocated expenses of $280 million this year, up compared to our 2024 results and reflective of a normalized level of recurring expenses. The primary drivers of the reduced 2024 expense were state tax and environmental-related benefits that are not expected to recur in 2025.\nThird, we expect a pretax gain from the training service divestiture of $205 million, which will also flow through corporate unallocated. Our 2025 estimated tax rate is projected at low to mid-17%. And we are reaffirming our 2025 free cash flow guidance range of greater than 15% growth at the midpoint. Speaking of cash, due to our strong performance in 2024, we ended the year with a cash balance of nearly $4.4 billion. In early January, we repaid $1.5 billion of notes that matured. This year, our investments in R&D and CapEx are projected at over $2.5 billion, and we expect to return 100% of our free cash flow to investors. As we look ahead, there are many opportunities in front of us. the foundation we have built sets the stage for continued growth in value creation.\nOur investments in advanced technologies, bord-making strategies and disciplined financial management, ensure we are well prepared to capitalize on emerging opportunities. I'm confident that together, we will continue to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call.\nToday's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Before we start, due to technical issues with our provider, we have provided a new dial-in information for the analysts. So please use that to dial into the call. Moving on, matters discussed today on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2025 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In addition, we will refer to a presentation that is posted to our Investor Relations website.\nOn the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Ken Crews, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. At Northrop Grumman, we remain steadfast in our mission to innovate and deliver cutting-edge technologies that enhance national security for the U.S. and our allies. We are harnessing our investments to manufacture at scale, the integrated hardware and software solutions that give our customers an advantage. Our strategy, which is based on technology differentiation, has resulted in another year of strong financial performance. We set a new record backlog, including significant new competitive wins and follow-on awards.\nWe ended the year with a backlog of approximately $91.5 billion and a book-to-bill ratio at 1.23x, providing a solid foundation for future growth. This was driven in part by a new competitive win on the Tacoma program, an award for the second [ Lot ] on B-21 in the fourth quarter. Over the past 3 years, our book-to-bill is 1.15x. Reflecting strong ongoing demand for our capabilities across U.S. and international markets. In the fourth quarter, we also booked $900 million for the next iteration of Poland's IBCS system. Bringing our international book-to-bill ratio for the year to 1.4x.\nGiven this strong demand, we now expect our international business to accelerate and grow faster than U.S. sales in 2025. Our proven ability to grow backlog and deliver key capabilities to our customers has led to another year of strong top line growth with 2024 sales up more than 4% and building on the momentum over the last 5 years, where our top line has grown by 30% organically. Meanwhile, our focus on performance and driving efficiencies in our business is leading to margin expansion. With segment operating margin dollars growing faster than sales. And our free cash flow performance for the year was outstanding, increasing 25% year-over-year to over $2.6 billion at the high end of our guidance range. As we look forward, our guidance reflects our expectation for continued solid organic growth of 3% to 4% and further segment margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth again in 2025.\nThis guidance is consistent with the outlook we provided to you in October. At Northrop Grumman, our portfolio is well positioned to provide critical deterrence capabilities and differentiating technology that address peer threats and achieve the shared goals of equipping the world's greatest military reaching new frontiers and space and improving the way industry and government do business.\nWe look forward to partnering with the Trump administration to accomplish these objectives. We expect Congress to complete FY '25 appropriations this spring, which is assumed in our guidance. As discussions continue regarding the U.S. defense budget and potential additional investments, we continue to see strong bipartisan support for national security. And global defense budgets are growing as our allies seek to counter aggressive from aggression from increasingly sophisticated threats. This is driving an increase in demand, particularly in areas such as crude and on crude aircraft, advanced weapons and missile defense. These dynamics give us confidence in our strong international growth outlook.\nAt our core, we are a technology company, and we are well positioned on programs that are essential to the U.S. and our allies national security. More than just an integrator, we possess technology depth throughout Northrop Grumman, not only in what we produce, but in how we produce it. This combination allows us to compete and win on priority programs and support our customers' goals of peace through strength. One example is our government trusted design and development to specialized microelectronics for the Department of Defense through our accredited foundries. In our Microelectronics Center, we build on our path to innovate for [ future ]. And continually disrupt our own technology to bring unmatched capabilities to the U.S. military. Our Terahertz Microchip, which operates at 1 trillion cycles per second is the fastest in the world according to the Guinness World Record. This type of innovation is realized through material science, new hardware design and manufacturing techniques and advanced software development. all capabilities that we have built and refined over time and possess at scale so we can deliver for our customers' most challenging missions.\nAs a result of having this capability, our microelectronics business grew over 20% in 2024. And equally important, it creates competitive advantages for Northrop Grumman by providing mission-critical technologies that flow upwards through our value chain, are married with missionize software and then are designed into product areas such as sensors, communications, processing and security solutions. We delivered these game-changing capabilities as a prime contractor on platforms we build and also offer them as a trusted supplier to other platform manufacturers. As technological change accelerates, it becomes more important that we continue to deliver technology discriminators, whether that's time together capabilities for family of system solutions or developing additional use cases for our missionized AI and enhance our solutions or accelerate decision-making.\nWe are leveraging our own hardware and software and also partnering with leading companies in areas such as AI to ensure our customers have the most advanced equipment in the world. Innovation and having the capabilities to meet our customer needs are important, but the ability to scale production and field new systems at speed are core to ultimate mission success. As we've grown our capacity, we've also been implementing advanced manufacturing techniques, automation and digital factories across our company. We are designing manufacturing and sustaining our next-generation systems with digital ecosystems that are improving our agility and efficiency and therefore, lowering our costs and time to field. These new manufacturing technologies, along with the capacity investments we've made enable us to rapidly ramp production. We've done this in areas like solid rocket motors, advanced weapons and satellite manufacturing. And these investments also allow us to more seamlessly transition major programs from design to production, like we've done with the B-21. All of which have been and will continue to be important drivers of growth for our company.\nNext, I'd like to update you on the plans we've previously shared to drive margin expansion. We continue to expect favorable mix to be a driver as we ramp on production programs and grow our international sales over the next several years. Beyond this, we are taking proactive actions to drive efficiencies across the company. These actions include implementation of digital tool sets that reduce process time, automate tasks and maximize output for our technical team. We're streamlining our organizational structure optimizing our supply chain spend and reducing costs through improved utilization of our resources and facilities. We removed over $200 million of cost in the enterprise in 2024 alone. We have a laser focus on performance excellence, driven by delivering first-time quality and robust risk management processes.\nAltogether, these cost efficiency initiatives, mix shifts, and focus on performance, give us confidence we can reduce cost to the taxpayer while also enhancing segment margins as we progress through this decade. This margin expansion, coupled with continued growth in our business and reduced capital investment are the drivers of our roto-year free cash flow growth outlook. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy that supports our customers' requirements and returns cash to shareholders. Over the past 2 years, we've invested over $3.5 billion in CapEx to expand our capacity and implement the advanced manufacturing lines across our company. And we are planning to invest another $1.5 billion in 2025.\nWe've also delivered over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders last year. We continue to believe we have the best portfolio that is aligned to our customers' highest priority missions. However, as we always do, we continuously evaluate the portfolio to ensure that we are investing in the businesses that are core to achieving our strategic vision. This includes accessing any gaps that may emerge over time or businesses that may make sense to active. With this in mind, we've decided to exit our training services business that is part of Defense Systems segment. Today, we announced that we have signed an agreement to sell the business to Circo Inc. for $327 million, and we forecast this transaction to close towards the middle of the year. This is an important capability for our customers, and we expect the team to continue to deliver world-class training services under new leadership, allowing us to focus on our core business.\n2024 was marked by strong program execution, compelling financial performance, implementation of operational improvements and impactful strategic initiatives that have positioned us for long-term success. Our ability to capitalize on opportunities and deliver exceptional results is a direct testament to the hard work and dedication of every member of our company. Our strategic priorities remain focused on fostering innovation, enhancing operational excellence and expanding our impact for our customers.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our 2025 guidance. Ken?\n\nKenneth B. Crews\n\nCorporate Vice President & CFO\n\nThank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy outlined, we delivered another strong year of financial performance in 2024, delivering on or exceeding the financial commitments that we communicated a year ago. This sustained performance is a reflection of our strategic positioning, continued focus on operational excellence and disciplined approach to financial management. We continue to see robust and enduring demand for our capabilities in both domestic and international markets. Reflecting this demand, we booked $17.3 billion in new awards in the fourth quarter and approximately $51 billion for the full year.\nThis led to a record backlog of over $91 billion, an increase of 9% compared to last year, positioning the company for continued growth. Moving to top line. We generated sales of $10.7 billion in quarter 4 and $41 billion for the year. 2024 sales increased by 4.4%, with growth across 3 of our 4 businesses. Transitioning to segment performance. NGAS grew to $12 billion in 2024, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Sales volume increased throughout the portfolio and was driven by the production ramp on B-21 and from higher activity on the F-35 program. Sales were also higher on autonomous programs such as Triton and Global Hawk. And we saw higher volume on E2 sustainment and modernization work. DS posted sales growth of 3%, driven by higher sales on Sentinel, advanced weapons and ammunition programs. partially offset by lower volume due to the completion of an international training program.\nMission Systems sales increased by 5%, led by higher volume on advanced and microelectronics and technology programs. And in the Space segment, 2024 sales were down modestly as expected compared to the prior year due to the wind down of a restrictive program and NGAD. As we previously stated, the remaining space portfolio grew at mid-single digits in 2024, driven by higher sales on Space Development Agency satellite programs and numerous other programs. Turning to the bottom line. 2024 segment operating income was over $4.5 billion, and our segment operating margin rate expanded to 11.1%. Margins improved due to the proactive steps we've taken to further enhance performance and drive efficiencies across our business, as Kathy described earlier in the call. This performance led to an increase in net favorable earnings adjustments totaling $350 million for the year. Strong segment performance was the driver for higher year-over-year earnings per share, as shown on Slide 6 in our earnings deck. 2024 mark-to-market adjusted EPS was $26.08 and exceeded the high end of our guidance range provided in October. Higher net pension income and a lower share count also provided an uplift.\nMoving to cash. We had an excellent quarter of cash generation in Q4, as is our historical pattern. Our full year operating cash flow was $4.4 billion, and we invested roughly $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. This resulted in over $2.6 billion in 2024 free cash flow, near the high end of our guidance range and up a notable 25% compared to 2023. Next, I would like to provide an update on our pension results and multiyear estimates. Asset returns in 2024 were 4.7%, below our long-term expected rate of return of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the FAS discount rate increased by roughly 60 basis points to 5.73%. More than offsetting the impact from lower asset returns. The net result, along with updated census data is a 2024 mark-to-market after-tax benefit of $332 million or $2.26 a share.\nLooking forward, these results translate to slightly higher expected CAS recoveries and a reduced FAS pension benefit lowering overall net pension income compared to the prior outlook. Importantly, our pension plans remain fully funded, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Before covering our 2025 guidance, I'll highlight recent changes to our portfolio. In addition to the upcoming divestiture of the training services business, which has an annual run rate of $300 million in sales, the strike and surveillance aircraft services business unit has been realigned from defense systems to aeronautic systems.

Fourth quarter and 2024 results have been reported in the prior organization structure and we've provided a few tables in our earnings release and slide deck that recast sales and margins for current and historical periods. Moving forward, we'll report first quarter 2025 results and beyond in the new structure. And our 2025 segment guidance also reflects the new structure inclusive of the divestiture.\nTurning to 2025. Our segment guidance is included on Slide 8 in our earnings deck. Aeronautic sales are expected to be in below $13 billion, representing mid-single-digit growth. This includes nearly $400 million of sales from the realignment previously mentioned. Aeronautics margins are expected in the mid- to high 9% range and reflect higher sales on the LRIP phase of B-21. 2025 DSLs are projected in the low $8 billion. We expect DS to be our fastest-growing business in 2025 with double-digit organic sales growth, driven by higher sales on Sentinel, IBCS and our diverse weapons portfolio. Segment operating margin at DS is expected to grow faster than sales with an OM rate of mid- to high 9%.\nSales at Mission Systems are projected to grow mid-single digits again in 2025, with sales reaching approximately $12 billion. and operating margins are expected to expand approximately 50 basis points to mid-14%, as productivity initiatives continue to drive improved performance. We expect sales in the space segment of roughly $11 billion, reflecting a year-over-year headwind of $900 million from the wind down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs. And we expect an OM rate of high 10% at space ahead of where we ended 2024. At the company level, our 2025 guidance is consistent with the outlook we provided on our Q3 call. Full year sales are expected to grow 3% to 4% on an organic basis with first quarter sales and margins comparable to Q1 of last year.\nKeep in mind, the first quarter year-over-year company sales growth will be flat due to the program wind-downs in space with the majority of the year-over-year growth occurring in the second half of the year.

This year-over-year expansion is driven by the continuation of our efficiency and productivity initiatives as well as international growth. Our guidance for mark-to-market adjusted EPS is $28.5 at the midpoint, up more than 7% year-over-year. Next, I want to take a moment to highlight several contributing factors to this outlook.

Second, we are projecting corporate unallocated expenses of $280 million this year, up compared to our 2024 results and reflective of a normalized level of recurring expenses. The primary drivers of the reduced 2024 expense were state tax and environmental-related benefits that are not expected to recur in 2025.\nThird, we expect a pretax gain from the training service divestiture of $205 million, which will also flow through corporate unallocated.

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And also, we will refer to a presentation that is posted on our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's earnings release, we delivered excellent operating results again this quarter, building on momentum from the first quarter. Our company's ability to respond to U.S. and international customer requirements with a wide range of advanced capabilities continues to drive strong growth, with sales up 7% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date. And our team's solid program performance, along with cost management discipline, led to operating income growth of 13% in the second quarter. The combined strength of our top and bottom line operating results was the primary driver of our 19% EPS growth. And in addition, we delivered robust free cash flow, which is up over $500 million compared to the first half of last year.\nBased on these strong first half results, and confidence in our team's ability to deliver on continued robust demand in the second half, we are increasing our 2024 revenue and EPS guidance. The breadth and depth of our portfolio is an important differentiator, particularly when coupled with the effectiveness of our strategy in aligning our resources to anticipate and deliver on our customers' needs. Given this, I'm going to take the next couple of minutes to provide important context on our portfolio. When you step back and look at the key components of our business, you'll see that 85% of our sales come from a diverse collection of technology advanced capabilities, such as electronic communications, crude and uncrewed aircraft, space payloads, advanced weapons, command and control systems and other product areas which are critical to global security.\nThe capabilities we provide often as a supplier are in the nation's most advanced space air, land, sea and undersea platforms. In the last several years, we've been selected through dozens of competition to develop and build differentiating technologies that will provide an advantage to the U.S. and our allies through the [ 2030s ]. The remaining 15% of our sales is comprised of two prime programs in support of the nation's strategic deterrent of course, that's Sentinel and B-21, with each generating a high single-digit percentage of our revenue today, and we expect that balance to continue for several years. With the recent realignment of our SCS division to our Defense Systems sector, we have four strong and differentiated segments that are more equal in size with each having multiple avenues for profitable growth.\nOur business is well aligned with the U.S. National Defense strategy. And as I've outlined in recent years, we've won significant roles on long-term programs that address the threat environment of today and are expected to do so for the next several decades. In addition, we continue to expand exportable product offerings, and we are developing our international partner and supplier base to position us for the growing international markets. We have also invested to increase our capacity to deliver the quantities of rocket motors, armaments and air and missile defense capabilities needed by the U.S. and our allies to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe.\nExamples of this growth include the guided multiple launch rocket system or GMLRS, where our year-to-date revenue has grown by nearly 60%. Additionally, we were awarded over $500 million in contract for ammunition that we will begin delivering in the third quarter. And we see additional demand for international ammunition opportunities in the coming quarters. Overall, the key takeaway is that the breadth of our portfolio, our alignment to the key priorities for the U.S. and our allies and our role on each leg of the U.S. strategic trial provides us visibility into avenues for our business to grow even if U.S. budget growth slows.\nAnd as we've discussed frequently over the last 2 years, we're not just focused on top line growth, we're taking deliberate actions to enhance profitability through digital enablement, productivity, supplier management and cost efficiency. As we look at the remainder of this year and next, we expect solid growth across the portfolio to continue, particularly in areas such as weapon systems, advanced electronics and aeronautics. International sales are also progressing from our pipeline to our backlog and are expected to contribute to increased sales and profitability. Our outlook is supported by the national security spending environment.\nIn the U.S., the fiscal year 2025 defense budget is moving through the appropriations process with recent markups by Congress. We were pleased to see the Senate Arm Services Committee increased the FY '25 top line by [ $25 billion ]. and we're encouraged by continued support for investment in defense. Northrop programs broadly and particularly the B-21 Sentinel in Colombia, which provide the basis for the U.S. strategic deterrent continue to receive strong support bolstering our view that we're well positioned in this such an environment. Given the importance of the triad to the nation's deterrence, I'll provide an update on two legs of the triad for which Northrop Grumman is the prime industry partner to the Department of Defense. So starting with Sentinel.\nEarlier this month, the DoD submitted to Congress certification of the Sentinel program as part of the Nunn-McCurdy process. This certification validates the need for the land-based leg of the triad and continued confidence in the sentinel weapon system, the critical role it plays in safeguarding global security. DoD and the Air Force are working to restructure the program to reflect the latest cost and schedule estimates. The majority of the cost growth is expected to occur in the production phase of the program, which is beyond the current EMD phase and outside of the future year's defense program or fight it.\nWe continue to execute on our existing EMD contract, which includes the design, development and testing of the full system. We are partnered with the Air Force on completing the design of all aspects of the system and how many of the systems components already in development and tests, including all three stages of the missile, command and launch subsystems for launch activation, security and systems monitoring as well as transportation and support equipment. The progress we've made on the program is significant, and we remain committed to partnering with the U.S. Air Force to identify ways to reduce the costs associated with feeling this system. So turning to the air leg of the triad.\nThe B-21 is progressing well through the testing program, and as you know, has entered low rate initial production. The team continues to perform exceptionally well, and we remain within our schedule and cost estimates. As we recently shared, B-21 test pilots report that the aircraft is flying like the simulator, which is another indication that our digital environment has effectively predicted the performance of the aircraft, thus reducing new discovery and risk. For these reasons and more, we continue to believe in the significant value this program will create for customers and shareholders over time.\nIt's important to note that while the B-21 program is very important, it contributes less than 10% of our total sales, and we expect that to remain the case through the decade. Assuming stable economic conditions and continued strong performance by our team, we also expect program margin dollars to grow annually from here as we complete the EMD program and for five lots of production move into advanced production awards on the more profitable [ lab ] and beyond and add modernization and sustainment revenue to the program.\nAs you can see, our portfolio includes a compelling mix of technology-driven capabilities and franchise programs that are well aligned to the evolving needs of all of our customers. As a result, we've grown our organic revenue at greater than 5% compound annual growth over the past 5 years, including 5% growth projected in our increased 2024 guidance. We also continue to rapidly expand our cash flows, including generating over $1 billion of free cash in the second quarter. Based on the strength of our portfolio, backlog and performance trends, we are reiterating our long-term cash flow outlook, which assumes a greater than 15% compound annual growth rate through 2026.\nTo support growth in our business, we're maintaining our investments and capabilities across the company. We continue to target $1.8 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is around 4.5% of revenue and well above the industry average. Including R&D, we're investing approximately $3 billion in our portfolio. At the same time, we're efficiently returning capital to shareholders, including $2.3 billion in the first half of the year. In May, we increased the dividend by 10%. This is our 21st consecutive annual increase as we continue to focus on delivering competitive sustainable dividend growth.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dave to provide more details on our financial performance and outlook, I'd like to thank our team for another great quarter as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. We have an outstanding portfolio, a high-performing team and a bright outlook for the future. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q2 results and outlook, I'd like to take a moment and provide some context around our financials, given the recent segment realignment. As Kathy noted, the Strategic Deterrent Systems division, which includes Sentinel and other related programs moved from our Space Systems segment to our Defense Systems segment effective July 1. Second quarter results have been reported in the prior organizational structure given the effective date of the realignment, but we've provided a table in the earnings release and earnings slides the recast sales and margin for current and historical periods under the new organizational structure. Moving forward, we will report third quarter results and beyond under the new structure and our updated financial guidance is also under the new structure. So with that, let's get into our second quarter results. Starting with demand.\nQ2 net awards totaled over $15 billion, generating a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5x and increasing our backlog to over $83 billion. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect a full year book-to-bill ratio of more than 1x sales. Turning to our top line results on Slide 4 in our earnings deck.\nSecond quarter sales were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2023. All four segments generated year-over-year growth again in Q2. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect a gradual ramp in our quarterly sales profile with Q3 sales projected to be roughly in line with Q2. Aeronautics' second quarter sales increased by 14%, with similar drivers to Q1, higher volume on B-21, F-35 and Triton again led the way. At DS sales grew by 7%, primarily due to higher volume on certain military ammunition programs and higher volume from the timing of materials on GMLRS. Mission Systems sales increased by 5%, with continued strong growth on advanced microelectronics programs, our Marine Systems portfolio and SEWIP.\nAnd at Space, sales were up by 2%, driven by growth on the SDA transport layer programs and GEM 63 solid rocket motors, partially offset by lower sales in the restricted space portfolio. Bottom line results were also very strong with segment operating income up 5% year-over-year and total operating income up 13%. These results reflect another solid quarter of overall program performance as well as lower corporate unallocated expense. AS operating income grew by 6%, generating an operating margin rate of 10% for the second straight quarter. These results have provided an example of how strong program performance, focused productivity initiatives and indirect cost efficiencies can generate margin rates at these levels even as we ramp on B-21.\nSpeaking of B-21, there were no significant changes to our LRIP EAC again this quarter. There are currently 21 aircraft in baseline for the first five LRIP lots and another 19 production aircraft subsequent to these for which we have not to exceed or NTE pricing. These prices were set in 2018, and given that the production for those lots was well into the future, the average unit NTE price was set above the average LRIP price. The NTE lots include an economic price adjustment clause to protect against certain inflationary pressures. Pricing, final quantities and terms and conditions have yet to be fully negotiated for these additional aircraft. Based on our current projections, we expect to be able to execute the NTE lots profitably.\nAs you think about the trajectory of the overall program, we expect to begin work on long lead items related to the NTE lots in 2026. Overall production will continue to ramp through the second half of the decade. And we expect that production sales will become larger than EMD beginning in 2026. Other B-21 efforts for modernization and sustainment will also begin to grow over the next couple of years. and are expected to generate profit rates that are accretive to the overall program. Taking all these factors together, we currently project that margin dollars for the overall program will gradually expand going forward, as Kathy outlined.\nDefense Systems had a particularly strong quarter, with operating income up 23% and a margin rate of 13.5%. Higher net EAC adjustments and favorable changes in contract mix contributed to their significant year-over-year improvement. At Mission Systems, operating margin rate was 13%, which was lower than Q2 of last year. Similar to Q1, this was a result of lower net EAC adjustments and changes in contract mix towards more cost-type contracts. While margin rates at current levels remain very competitive, they are below MS' historical performance, and we continue to see opportunities to improve margins in the second half of the year.\nThese improvements will be driven by continued investments we're making in our factories to improve performance and increase production volumes as well as from the business mix shifting to more fixed price work. Space had another solid quarter of operating performance with operating income increasing 14% from the prior year, generating a margin rate of 9.1%. We've seen improvements in space program performance for multiple quarters now as a result of deliberate actions we've taken in the business. Moving to earnings per share on Slide 6.\nQ2 diluted EPS was $6.36. This represents an increase of 19% from the prior year, driven by continued strong growth in segment performance as well as from higher net pension income and lower corporate unallocated expense. Rounding out our Q2 results is cash flow. We had an excellent quarter of cash generation with Q2 free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up 80% compared to our results from Q2 of last year. And on track with our expectations for the full year. We returned approximately $900 million to investors in Q2 via dividends and share repurchases, while also continuing to make strategic investments in our business. Slide 7 includes our latest segment guidance based on our new organizational structure.\nWe are increasing our sales guidance at both AS and MS, neither of which were affected by the sector realignment. AS is now projected in the high $11 billion and MS is projected in the mid-$11 billion. The increases are driven by the strength of their year-to-date results and expectations for the rest of the year. As we indicated on our Q1 call, Aeronautics sales are expected to flatten out in the second half of the year based on timing of materials and production schedules. We've also updated our margin expectations for AS and MS.\nWe now expect a margin rate at Aeronautics of mid- to high 9%, reflecting their ability to generate strong margins across their mix of mature production programs and early-stage development programs. The increase at AS offsets the decrease in margin rate at MS, which is now projected at low to mid 14%. At DS, we've increased our sales guidance this year to roughly $9 billion. This reflects the realignment of the SDS division to DS, which is expected to generate sales this year of roughly $2.7 billion. The increase also reflects our expectations for higher sales volume associated with ammunition and weapons replenishment. We expect Space sales to be relatively flat this year, projected in the mid- to high $11 billion range and to be down somewhat in 2025.\nThis profile is driven by the removal of NGI and the restricted program during 2024, which collectively had a run rate of about $1.5 billion in annualized sales. Those headwinds affect both this year and next, of which the larger impact will be experienced in 2025. We expect the rest of the space portfolio to continue to grow. Overall, we expect a relatively stable level of margin dollars in space in 2025 as the margin rate grows and offsets pressure from lower volume. Space's guidance also reflects higher intercompany sales, primarily associated with propulsion activities in support of the Sentinel program. This also has the effect of increasing company level eliminations to roughly $2.7 billion. We expect a margin rate at DS of approximately 10% this year and a low 10% rate at space given the shifts in the portfolio.\nIn total, we now expect company level sales of $41 billion to $41.4 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment OM dollars to grow at roughly the same rate as sales. We've lowered our expectations for corporate unallocated expense to $150 million based on year-to-date trends. We continue to expect corporate unallocated expense to be weighted toward the second half of the year, consistent with prior years. We've increased our expectation for the federal tax rate to the mid-17% and and slightly lowered our expectation for interest expense to roughly $650 million.\nAs we've noted in prior quarters, we're monitoring for any favorable or unfavorable updates in tax legislation, audits and appeals processes that by their nature, are not factored into our guidance. And based on the latest plans for a higher volume of share repurchases, we've lowered our estimate for weighted average shares outstanding to the mid $147 million. Altogether, our strong performance and outlook results in an increase of $0.45 to our diluted EPS range. We had a strong first half of the year, and we're looking forward to continuing to create value in the second half and beyond.\nSo with that, let's open up the call for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We'll refer to a presentation that is posted on our IR website this morning. Before we start, matter is discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThank you Todd. Good morning, everyone. It's so good to have you joining us today. So earlier this morning, we released our first quarter results. And as you can see, we are off to a strong start to the year. with broad-based growth across our portfolio. The team's relentless execution of our strategy, which includes technology leadership aligned to our customers' priorities and a laser focus on performance has positioned us for continued success. Growing global demand for our capabilities led to an exceptional 9% year-over-year increase in Q1 sales. driven by growth in all 4 of our sectors.\nThe productivity and cost efficiency measures we've been implementing are gaining traction, and our program performance in the quarter was strong, resulting in segment operating margin dollars increasing by 10%. Operating profit expansion, along with the lower share count helped to drive 15% EPS growth. Overall, our first quarter performance was in line with or better than our expectations, and we are reaffirming our 2024 company level guidance. Global demand for our products continues to be robust, fueled by rising defense budgets and our market position. We're pleased that an agreement was reached on the U.S. fiscal year 2024 defense budget, which includes support for our key programs and represents a 6% growth in investment accounts over 2023.\nIn March, the administration released the 2025 defense budget and future years' defense program or fight it. And these also were consistent with our expectations. We continue to see robust support for our program portfolio in areas that include nuclear modernization, microelectronics, advanced weapons in space. Together, the appropriations and site-up give us confidence in our longer-term outlook even if we experience a somewhat slower top line growth environment for the U.S. defense budget in the short term.\nAs we look beyond the domestic market, we continue to see numerous new international opportunities as well. They span a wide range of capabilities across our portfolio, and they provide an additional avenue for sustainable and profitable growth. In the first quarter, Poland signed a letter of acceptance with the U.S. government for an additional implementation of our IBCS product line, known as Narav. This represents the short-range air and missile defense portion of Poland's missle defense architecture, and it will augment the medium-range portion, which is currently being deployed. In addition to Poland, we see an IBCS pipeline now of approximately $10 billion from numerous countries who are considering this joint battle management system.\nAnother important suite of international opportunities for Northrop Grumman is sensor modernization of fourth-generation aircraft. This includes our IVUS electronic warfare offering, which leverages the U.S. program of record. IVUS has been down selected by 2 international partners, and we are in discussions with 7 other countries. Overall, IVUS has the potential to be a new multibillion-dollar product line for us. We're also well positioned to address emerging international opportunities for autonomous systems.\nThe first of 4 Triton aircraft is expected to be delivered to Australia later this year. In addition, NATO is actively looking to expand its maritime surveillance capabilities, enabling a higher degree of interoperability amongst allied nations. We believe our Triton program is well suited to meet these requirements, providing an opportunity for up to 5 aircraft. And we see additional Triton opportunities emerging elsewhere in Europe.\nThere also continues to be an uptrend in U.S. and allied partner demand for missile products and ammunition. This includes several significant ammunition opportunities for allies that in aggregate have the potential to support further growth in our Defense Systems portfolio at solid margins. And this week, the U.S. Congress has supplemental funding bill, which includes munitions procurement and missile product capacity expansion.\nAs we shared in our prior calls, to meet growing demand across our weapon systems business, we have been investing in our largest solid rocket motor production facility over the past 5 years, and we have now tripled our production capacity for tactical SRMs. Technology leadership is an important part of our business strategy. And we've been investing to maintain our lead in microelectronics for defense applications. To further this objective, we recently established the Northrop Grumman Microelectronics Center, which brings together our microelectronic capability from across the company into one organization. It will be led by our Mission Systems business, where over 80% of their revenue is enabled by our innovation and investments in microelectronics.\nToday, our U.S. microelectronics facilities produce over 1 million microchips a year. with tailored design, fabrication and advanced packaging needed to support the most advanced defense systems and sensors. We also work with leading-edge technology developers in the commercial space, like NVIDIA to incorporate their technology into our national security solutions. In addition to advancement in capability, we are expanding our capacity in this important technology area.\nIn the quarter, we held a groundbreaking ceremony for our new advanced electronics facility in Wattensboro, Virginia. With this $200 million investment, we are increasing our ability to manufacture and test advanced electronics and mission solutions. As I mentioned earlier, we are laser-focused on performance and driving cost efficiencies in our business. This includes deploying systems and tools that help enable increased productivity across our business.\nIn the first quarter, we completed the implementation of a significant financial ERP upgrade, which consolidated multiple versions of our prior system, and it will significantly improve the efficiency of our operations. This new system provides a foundation that supports many of the other digital transformation initiatives. And it plays an integral role in our longer-term margin expansion strategy. The upgrade, as you would understand, was a massive undertaking that was achieved with minimal disruption to our business. It's really a credit to the entire team who worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. We also continue to proactively address our overhead costs and indirect rates to drive affordability for our customers. We saw benefits of this in the first quarter, particularly in production programs at both AS and DS. Efficiency in both direct and indirect cost management continues to be a priority across the company.\nProgram execution is another area of particular emphasis in 2024. In our space sector, after rapid growth over the last several years, we are keenly focused on delivering key capabilities for our customers, executing our extensive backlog and generating strong returns in the process. This includes the progress we're making on the Sentinel program. We're continuing to execute the EMD phase of the program, and we've made solid progress on design and development activities for the facilities and support equipment as well as the missile itself. The Nunn-McCurdy review is continuing, and we are providing support to the Department of Defense in that process as well. It's a complex undertaking to modernize the U.S. strategic deterrent, which requires delivering the most advanced capabilities in the world to form the basis of that deterrent. We're honored to be part of this vital mission, so we're partnering with our customers in bringing the focus, resources and talent needed to deliver on those commitments.\nFinally, I'd like to provide an update on our capital deployment strategy. First and foremost, we are investing in capabilities that meet our customers' needs to address rapidly evolving threats. This year, we continue to expect that we'll invest roughly $1.8 billion in capital expenditures bringing our total investment to nearly $8 billion since the beginning of 2020. These investments have contributed to our strong growth performance and outlook. At the same time, we are efficiently returning capital to shareholders, including nearly $1.5 billion in the first quarter.\nSo in summary, with a broad portfolio of well-supported programs continued new domestic and international opportunities, a relentless focus on performance and a capital deployment strategy designed to create value for customers and shareholders alike. Northrop Grumman Corporation is well positioned for the future.\nSo with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Dave, and he's going to cover some of the details of our financial performance and outlook before we take your questions. Dave?\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy highlighted, we're off to a strong start to the year. Sales, operating income and EPS all increased meaningfully from the first quarter of 2023 as we execute on our backlog and drive efficiencies in our business.\nStarting with our top line results on Slide 4 in our earnings deck. First quarter sales increased 9% to $10.1 billion. We were pleased to deliver higher Q1 sales at all 4 of our segments. These results were ahead of our initial projections for the first quarter, due in part to the timing of material volume on certain programs. With that in mind, we expect a more gradual ramp in our quarterly sales profile than in the past few years. I'll address the factors contributing to this as I walk through updates to our segment guidance.\nAs AS sales were particularly strong, up 18%, driven by higher volume on the B-21 program as well as on mature production programs like F-35. Defense Systems sales increased 3%, primarily due to growth on multiple programs in our weapons business, and as expected, were partially offset by lower volume on an international training program.\nMission Systems sales grew by 4% and led by rapid growth on advanced microelectronics programs in our restricted portfolio, partially offset by lower volume on SABR. And sales at space increased by 9% with broad-based growth throughout the portfolio, including on the SDA transport layer programs as they continue to ramp.\nTurning to the bottom line. We remain laser-focused on performance. In Q1, we generated segment operating income of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 10%. Margin rate was also solid at 10.9%. As we've outlined on previous earnings calls, we expect to increase our margin rate over time as mix shifts favorably, macro conditions improve and productivity measures continue to bear fruit. Aeronautics operating income increased 25% for an operating margin rate of 10%. Efficient indirect rate performance, driven by productivity initiatives and careful cost management helped to generate a healthy volume of favorable net EAC adjustments. These adjustments were recognized across the AS portfolio but primarily benefited mature production programs.\nOn B-21, there were no significant changes to our EACs, and we continue to make good progress in the test phase of the EMD program and on the build of the LRIP production units in flow. We have finalized negotiations with additional suppliers on the LRIP phase of the program and are in the late stages of negotiations with the remaining.\nDefense Systems operating income grew 11%. They also benefited from favorable mix and indirect rate performance, driving their OM rate to 12.5%. At Mission Systems, segment operating income increased 5% and margin rate increased 20 basis points to 14.2%. MS' OM rate benefited from favorable mix on higher-margin advanced microelectronics programs, partially offset by lower net favorable EAC adjustments. We see opportunities to further improve performance at MS, driven by operational efficiencies and investments we've made in our factories. Lastly, space operating income increased 6% and its margin rate was a solid 9.1%.\nMoving to earnings per share on Slide 6. Diluted EPS were $6.32 in Q1, an increase of 15% from the prior year. The increase was driven by our strong growth in segment performance as well as from higher net pension income and a lower share count.\nTurning to cash flow. We're pleased with our cash performance. particularly in light of our ERP conversion that went live in the first quarter. This was a significant undertaking that will help to drive additional efficiencies in our business over time.\nQ1 free cash flow was an outflow of approximately $1 billion, and we expect a strong quarter of cash generation in Q2. This profile is consistent with our seasonal pattern of generating the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year.\nMoving to guidance. We are reaffirming our 2024 company level guidance and have a few updates at the segment level. We continue to project a book-to-bill ratio close to 1x for the year. Note, we expect a higher ratio at AS, DS and MS and a lower ratio at space. given all the backlog growth that has generated in recent years and flattening U.S. space budgets. At the company level, we expect our second quarter sales and segment margin volume to be roughly in line with the strong Q1 results with modest expansion in the second half. We expect the quarterly profile to vary at the segment level, so I'll take a moment to provide some additional color. First, DS and MS sales and margin dollars are expected to ramp throughout the year, generally consistent with prior year patterns. Restricted programs in MS continue to expand, and the DS Weapons business has significant demand that Kathy described, which should lead to further second half growth.\nOur margin rate guidance was adjusted slightly higher at DS and slightly lower at MS, reflecting our Q1 performance and latest expectations for the remainder of the year. At aeronautics we are increasing our sales guidance to the mid-$11 billion to reflect our strong Q1 results and our latest projections for B-21 sales timing. But the quarterly sales profile is projected to be different this year than it was in 2023. We the timing of materials volume, primarily on F-35 and B-21, drove additional Q1 sales. So we'd expect a flatter profile through the remaining quarters. As our full year guidance indicates, AS margin rates are expected to be lower in subsequent quarters based on business mix and the strength of Q1 EAC adjustments. For the full year, we continue to expect margins in the mid-9% range.\nAnd at Space, we're lowering our sales guidance to the low to mid $14 billion, which roughly reflects 3% annual growth. Sales volume is now expected to trend lower over the remaining quarters of 2024, reflecting the NGI decision and the contract termination and restricted space that we noted last quarter. This is expected to be partially offset by continued growth in Sentinel and the SDA portfolio. Below the segment line, we are reaffirming our company-level guidance reflecting the strength of our broad portfolio. We continue to expect corporate unallocated costs to be weighted toward the second half of the year, consistent with prior years. Interest expense will also be higher in future quarters due to the additional debt issuance in Q1, and we continue to project an effective tax rate around 17%. As we've noted before, we're monitoring any changes in tax legislation and any updates in our tax appeals processes that by their nature, are not factored into our guidance.\nAnd as a reminder, we completed a $2.5 billion debt offering at attractive rates shortly after the filing of our 10-K. The proceeds will be used in part to retire $1.5 billion of notes that are maturing in January 2025 as well as for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase in Q1, which is now nearly complete. In total, including our open market purchases, our Q1 repurchases were $1.2 billion. For the full year, we have increased our expectations for share repurchases to greater than $2 billion.\nWe also remain committed to providing a strong and growing dividend. Our capital deployment plans are enabled by our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows in our diverse and durable portfolio. We continue to project industry-leading investments in our business to support our customers while returning excess cash to shareholders. We're confident that this business strategy will create value for all our stakeholders.\nIn summary, we're off to a great start to the year, and we remain upbeat about our long-term outlook.\nAnd with that, let's open the call for questions."

Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce, which is now over 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customers every day to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. .\nThe geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex, driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategy has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market, which has translated into accelerating top line growth through Northrop Grumman.\nRevenue increased by over 7% in 2023, ending the year, more than $1 billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14x. That's in line with our exceptional 4-year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog, which now exceeds $84 billion, and that provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range absent the B-21 charge.\nWhile we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program.\nAs we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core, is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, up 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success.\nWe also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow.\nSo now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket booster helped to successfully power ULA's Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon Kiper and other ULA customers. providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of Gem 63s in the coming years.\nGlobal demand for our weapon systems increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses and cannons across a highly diversified customer base and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles including RGM ER and Stanton attack weapon. Weapon Systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue and based on the demand we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers.\nIn our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2x, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth. As our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors and secure communications. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment.\nAnd we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next-generation land-based leg of the strategic Triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a non McCurdy breach. This in turn, launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months.\nIt's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the Command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce cost on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years.\nFollowing this milestone, we were awarded the first [indiscernible] plot in the fourth quarter, and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge, the possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding meets [indiscernible] production lots in 2015.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the Albert phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable, each of the first 5 [indiscernible] lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the Albert phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after-tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect, and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years.\nThis is a game-changing capability that will be of great value to our nation, and we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies investing capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong, due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities, including the Triad, space and weapons.\nIn the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending, and we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriation soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards tapping appropriations in the March time frame.\nAdditionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding, and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending, and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook.\nOur organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019 and our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth, excluding the E21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates, which we provided in 2023.\nIn addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margin that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives, and future favorable mix shifts remain in place. We are laser-focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate over the coming years.\nWe are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook and we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy and we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D.\nAt the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come.\nSo now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance and the forward outlook. Dave?\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All 4 of our segments generated a full year book-to-bill ratio over onetime sales. .\nWe also continued to deliver strong top line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce and convert our backlog into sales.\nMoving to segment results. We generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. As growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission Systems sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our Space business posted another quarter of double-digit top line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio.\nAs Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pretax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded.\nThe charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, Slide 5 shows the comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40.\nOur 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%.\nNetted together, along with updated Census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next 3 years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections and we expect a higher level of nonoperating FAS pension income in the coming years driven by our strong asset returns in 2023.\nIn total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%. And and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024. Slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment level guidance. Building off the strong top line results in Q4, we now expect Aeronautics sales in the low $11 billion, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024.\nHigher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS which we now project in the mid-9% netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. And as we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business.\nMargins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission Systems sales are expected in the low to mid-$11 billion range for another year of mid-single-digit growth with margins of roughly 15%. In that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid- to high $14 billion range with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single-digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio.\nHaving built a tremendous backlog in recent years, Space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% and 5%, absent the B-21 charge consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings with a book-to-bill around 1x. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate.\nWe plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025 as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line as it did in 2023.\nWe project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion.\nWe will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade.\nThis expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years.\nLonger term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A."

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. On the call this morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted on our IR website.\nBefore we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2023 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are all witnessing significant geopolitical tensions across the globe, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the horrific attacks in Israel. We truly hope that peace and safety can be established for the people in these regions, and we'll continue in our steadfast support for the U.S. and our allies in their pursuit of global security and stability.\nOn this morning's call, in addition to reviewing our third quarter results and important program events in the quarter, I'll address the U.S. budget and trends we see in the global environment. And as usual, at this time of year, I'll provide our initial outlook for next year.\nSo starting with the quarter. Our book-to-bill was 1.5x with approximately $15 billion in awards, and our sales increased 9% year-over-year with growth across all 4 of our business segments. Our backlog now stands at $84 billion. It's a new record, and it strengthens the foundation for our future growth. It also continues to reflect the alignment we have with our customers' priorities and the continued success of our business strategy.\nSegment operating income increased by 8% year-over-year, and the OM rate increased over last quarter. Earnings per share were $6.18, up 5% compared to last year. Strong earnings rose nearly $900 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and we remain on track to achieve our 2023 free cash flow target.\nExcellent cash generation continues to provide us the flexibility to invest in our capabilities and capacity while returning capital to shareholders. We remain committed to returning over 100% of our free cash flow to investors this year, including $1.5 billion of share repurchases. And year-to-date, we've returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchases.\nSo turning now to the U.S. defense budget. As is common in recent years, the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution to start fiscal year 2024. We're encouraged by bipartisan support for national security priorities and are hopeful an agreement will be reached on full year appropriations soon. Our guidance and outlook assume a full year budget is passed by the end of this calendar year or early next year. And as we saw last week, the administration continues to make supplemental request for urgent needs, including those in Ukraine and Israel to include investments in weapon systems and defense industrial-based readiness.\nThe federal government is also developing its budget plans for fiscal year 2025, which we expect to be submitted to Congress early next year. We are working closely with our customers to plan for future capabilities and navigate the fiscal pressures they see to ensure our programs remain well supported.\nAs we have been discussing throughout the year, we are also seeing an increase in international demand for our capabilities. We've seen a particular increase in our weapon systems portfolio and missile defense technologies like the IBCS product line. One notable example of this growing demand is with AARGM-ER where we've now received interest for more than a dozen countries and just this week, the opportunity for a foreign military sale to Finland was announced.\nWe are also working with the U.S. government to provide new advanced weapons capabilities. During the second quarter, we received a $705 million contract from the United States Air Force to develop the Stand in Attack weapon, also known as SAW, an air to ground weapon with the capability to strike mobile defense targets. Our SAW offering builds on the capabilities we provide with our high-speed AARGM missile, which is in production.\nBuilding off a mature product baseline, we're able to reduce the developmental time, cost and risk to the SAW program. These missiles are expected to be the air-to-ground weapon of choice for the F-35 and other fighters.\nIn our Space business, we remain focused on being at the forefront of technology, and that strategy has enabled us to build a differentiated portfolio that provides end-to-end solutions for our customers. from new space architectures to launch capabilities. We see broad applications for the technologies we've developed with a particular focus on national security missions. This includes helping to turn the Space Development Agency's vision of a new low earth orbit constellation of satellites into reality. In August, we were awarded a $712 million contract to design and build 36 satellites for SDA's tranche 2 transport layer data constellation. With this award, along with our work on SDA's tracking layer and tranche 1 of the transport layer, we are now building nearly 100 satellites for the proliferated war fighter space architecture. Our success in this area highlight our ability to compete and win in highly competitive and dynamic new markets within the space domain.\nIn addition, we had 2 notable launch events in the quarter. We successfully launched our 19th resupply mission to the International Space Station as we continue to execute under NASA's commercial resupply contract. And 5 of our GEM 63 solid rocket boosters helped to power ULA's Atlas V launch of a national security payload. These rocket motors will continue to support future ULA launches to include ULA's Vulcan rocket.\nFor next-generation interceptor, we successfully manufactured the first set of solid rocket motor cases in August, and we're on track for our preliminary design review in the fourth quarter, more than a year earlier than the original contract date. These are just a few examples of the focus we have on strong program performance across the portfolio.\nNow before I turn the call over to Dave to provide more details on the quarter, I'd like to provide some initial color on our 2024 outlook. We continue to see solid growth across all 4 of our businesses. with sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% compared to our latest 2023 guidance, which we've now raised by $800 million throughout the year. We also expect operating income to grow by 4% to 5% year-over-year. We reaffirm our free cash flow outlook range of $2.25 billion to $2.65 billion in 2024, which accounts for continued investment in the capabilities and capacity needed to grow our business and support our customers.\nSo in summary, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to drive value creation for our customers and our shareholders. We are focused on executing our strategy, driving operating performance and generating cash for our disciplined capital deployment.\nSo now with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide some more details on the segment results, 2023 guidance and our outlook.\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy described, we generated another strong quarter of results. The business is well positioned in growing segments of the market, and we're delivering key capabilities that address our customers' missions. As macroeconomic conditions improve, and pension and tax cash flow headwinds reverse over the next few years, we have a great opportunity to create value for shareholders through substantial cash flow growth, consistent with our long-term strategy. Taking a look at our demand metrics, we ended the third quarter with a record backlog of $84 billion, bolstered by several new competitive awards. And as a result, we now expect our full year book-to-bill ratio to be well over 1x.\nTurning to the top line. We continue to build on our momentum from the first half of the year, with overall sales growth of 9% in the third quarter. This includes growth in all 4 of our segments for the second straight quarter as our teams continue to ramp up new wins, add new talent and manage through continued pressures in the supply chain.\nAt the segment level, Aeronautics posted sales growth of 90%, driven by higher volume on manned aircraft programs. DS grew by 6% on continued strength in their missile defense and armaments portfolios, including IBCS, GMLRS and [indiscernible]. Mission Systems continued to generate rapid growth of restricted sales in the Network Information Solutions business, driving their top line up 7%. [indiscernible] again delivered double-digit sales growth as a result of the continued ramp on programs like GBSD, NGI, OPIR and [indiscernible] in the restricted domain.\nMoving to segment margins. We're pleased with these bottom line results in a dynamic environment. In total, segment operating income grew by 8% compared to the third quarter last year. As we expected, we delivered an incremental improvement in our segment OM rate from earlier quarters this year, expanding to 11.1% in Q3. Program performance remained strong across the portfolio.\nOur Aeronautics and Defense businesses generated a healthy volume of favorable EAC adjustments through efficient execution and risk retirements. MS margins were down slightly as mix shifted to more cost-type development efforts, particularly in their restricted portfolio. In that space, given the rapid backlog growth we've experienced, strong execution and program performance are our top priorities. Space margins improved by 80 basis points this quarter compared to Q2. Diluted EPS in the third quarter were $6.18, up 5% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher sales and segment performance, along with a lower share count. We also recognized a gain from the sale of an Australian minority investment in Q3 that we described on prior calls and included in our guidance. Partially offsetting these items was lower net [indiscernible] income of roughly $1 per share, a nonoperational impact consistent with the first 2 quarters.\nQ3 was a strong period for cash generation with free cash flow of nearly $900 million. On a year-to-date basis, this brings us to nearly $500 million of free cash flow, well ahead of where we were at this time last year. We continue to remain disciplined in managing our working capital, and we saw improvements in these accounts across the company in Q3.\nWith respect to cash taxes, the IRS recently provided additional guidance on the amortization of research and development expenditures under Section 174 of the tax code. This guidance did not change our interpretation of the provision. But upon finalizing our 2022 tax returns, we lowered our estimates for Section 174 cash taxes based on applicable R&D costs that were below our original estimates. Offsetting the lower 174 taxes is an increase in other tax items, the net result of which is a multiyear cash tax forecast that is roughly unchanged.\nMoving to 2023 guidance. I'll begin with a few updates to our segment estimates as shown on Slide 7 in our earnings deck. First, based on the strength of our year-to-date results, we now expect modestly higher sales in our Aeronautics business in the mid- to high $10 billion range. This represents a return to growth this year at AS, a year earlier than expected, and continues to assume that we will be awarded the first LRIP lot on the B-21 program in the fourth quarter after first flight.\nThe Air Force said in September at the AFA Conference, we are progressing through ground testing, and we're on track to enter flight testing this year in line with the program baseline schedule. And we are again increasing our top line expectations for our Space segment based on new wins and continued strength in this business. We now expect 2023 sales of approximately $14 billion, which represents year-over-year sales growth of 14%.\nFor operating margin rate, we're projecting a slightly lower operating margin rate at MS to reflect their year-to-date trend line. Other segments are unchanged. At the enterprise level, we're increasing our sales guidance by another $400 million and now expect 2023 sales of approximately $39 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of roughly 6.5%. We are maintaining our guidance for segment operating income. Year-to-date trends would indicate figure towards the lower half of that range, and we're reaffirming our estimates for EPS and free cash flow.\nNext, I'll build on Kathy's comments on our 2024 outlook. Sales growth has accelerated sooner than we expected in 2023, and we continue to project growth at all 4 of our business segments next year. We expect segment margins in the low 11% range, and we continue to project improvement over time as we see benefits from the stabilizing macro environment, our cost efficiency initiatives, and our business mix improvements. We continue to anticipate CapEx to be roughly consistent as a percentage of sales in 2024 before declining in 2025 and beyond. And shareholder returns will remain a top priority for our free cash flow deployment, including returning at least 100% of free cash flow to shareholders next year.\nGiven the volatility in the financial markets, I'd also like to provide a quick update on our pension plans. Our funded status is now above 100% as of the end of Q3. And we continue to expect minimal required cash contributions over the next several years. This is a discriminator for us that supports our affordability and competitiveness as well as our capital deployment optionality. Given that our GAAP earnings per share are affected by net pension income, as we did last year, we have provided a pension income sensitivity table for 2024 on Slide 9. Our forecast in early 2023 was predicated on asset returns of 7.5% and a discount rate of roughly 5.5%. Through September 30, financial market movements have led to a roughly 50 basis point increase in discount rates and a year-to-date asset return of 1% to 2%. This combination of results would reduce net FAS pension income and increased CAS recoveries from our prior projections. Based on the sensitivities highlighted on the slide, the net result would be an impact to 2024 GAAP EPS of roughly $0.50 on compared to our initial outlook provided in January. Keep in mind that FAS pension income is noncash in nature. Higher CAS estimates would provide a modest benefit to our cash flows but could have a modest downward impact on EACs in the quarter in which they are updated, consistent with this year's pattern.\nSpeaking of cash flow, we continue to see a path to grow our cash flows at a greater than 20% CAGR next year and through 2025 with further expansion in the following years. As is our practice, we'll provide our latest multiyear outlook for free cash flows on the January earnings call. We remain confident in the long-term value creation opportunity from free cash flow expansion and disciplined capital deployment through the rest of the decade.\nWith that, let's open the call up for questions."

In the second quarter, our sales were up 9% with solid contributions from each of our 4 business segments. Our ability to hire and retain talent and improving supplier deliveries are strengthening our top line. Given our year-to-date sales increase of 7% and an improved outlook, we're increasing our full year sales guidance range by $400 million. In addition, award volume in the quarter was robust, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14. As a result, we're increasing our full year book-to-bill projection to approximately 1.0.\nOur $79 [ billion ] backlog continues to be more than 2x our expected 2023 sales supporting our long-term growth outlook. We delivered solid second quarter earnings per share of $5.34, and we're increasing the lower end of our full year guidance range by $0.20. And free cash flow was healthy in the quarter, more than $1 billion higher than Q2 of last year, positioning us well for our full year target.\nTurning to the budget environment and starting with the U.S., we're encouraged by the continued bipartisan support for national security funding to implement the administration's National Defense strategy. The FY '24 budget and recent congressional committee bills prioritize modernization, including areas of strength in our portfolio such as the Triad, the Space domain, information superiority and advanced weapons. We also anticipate continued support for Ukraine and related emergency spending, which would represent even further increased demand.\nGlobal demand for our products also continues to grow as our allies increased defense spending to address evolving threats. We are well positioned in multiple markets to meet this demand with programs such as AARGM, IBCS and E-2D as well as munitions. With a robust backlog and continued growth outlook, I'd like to now spend a few minutes outlining our path to margin expansion, which is a key element of our earnings and cash flow growth plans.\nOur 2023 operating margin dollar guidance is in the range we've previously provided. This guidance implies a segment margin rate in the mid-11% range in the second half of 2023, having delivered a rate of 10.9% in the first half. We also see an opportunity to increase our year-over-year margin rate in 2024 and get to a 12% target in the longer term. Achieving this margin improvement is built on 3 key drivers: First is the stabilization of temporal macroeconomic factors that have driven higher cost and impacted our supply chain and labor efficiency. Second is the ongoing implementation of cost management programs across the company that help drive affordability, competitiveness and performance. And third is our business mix, which we see shifting to more international and production contracts as international demand grows and many of our current development programs mature over the next several years.\nWith regard to the macroeconomic factors, supply chain disruptions rooted in the pandemic and the subsequent labor market tightness have created program delays and cost growth. To reduce this disruption, we're buying ahead of schedule, pursuing second sources where it makes sense and placing more of our people as suppliers to facilitate timely material deliveries. We see signs of progress across our supply chain from these actions, and we are seeing fewer new issues emerge.\nWe've had exceptional performance in growing our head count since the second half of 2022 and attrition rates are down to pre-pandemic levels. Our focus now is on optimizing labor efficiency, which is an important driver of profitability. To accelerate the learning curve for our employees, we're leaning forward with innovative training programs and standardizing work instructions.\nInflation has been a challenge for our industry as well as others. Cost growth has now begun to moderate, but the last 18 months of inflation continued to have a higher base effect on our costs, especially in labor. If you look at our year-end 2021 fixed-price backlog, it was largely priced before we began to experience elevated levels of inflation. However, of that backlog, approximately 70% will have been converted into sales by the end of this year. And for new bids, we are factoring higher inflation expectations into our contracts. We're also working to drive additional discipline in our bid approaches, particularly on fixed price contracts to help protect against these types of dynamics in the future. Overall, we anticipate that these macroeconomic impacts have stabilized and now have largely been incorporated into our margins or risk factors.\nThe second key driver of margin opportunity is cost management, which benefits both affordability and competitiveness. We are laser focused on overhead cost reduction. A foundational element of these reductions is our implementation of digital solutions across our business, which will help to drive performance and productivity. For example, we've built a digital ecosystem that focuses on program execution, bringing together employees, customers and partners into an integrated environment so they can seamlessly work together. This accelerates design, integration, testing and deployment across programs, helping us to deliver with quality, speed and efficiency. We're increasing the number of programs that are operating in this ecosystem. And today, we have over 100 active programs that are doing so.\nWe're also investing in and advancing the technologies and digital systems in our factories. We're scaling this across the enterprise to drive efficiencies that should benefit all of our stakeholders. For example, on the B-21, we've successfully demonstrated the use of this digital thread tie to advanced manufacturing technologies to realize over 15% labor efficiencies in one area of the build. And in June, we launched the expansion of this approach across the whole build process. We're extending this digital thread into our business operations to deliver further benefits across the company. This includes how we're managing our supply chain, where we've broadly centralized procurement and we're working to leverage our purchasing power to reduce costs.\nWe have over 20,000 suppliers, and we've begun securely connecting them into our digital ecosystem. Over the next several years, we expect to have the majority of our supply base fully integrated. This is expected to lower supplier costs and significantly improve productivity.\nThe third key area of margin opportunity is our business mix. For several years, we've had one of the highest cost plus development contract mixes in the industry, reflecting our significant early-stage position on key franchise programs, which will transition to production throughout this decade. This cost plus mix has been increasing, with our first half revenue at 55% cost plus, up from about 50-50 last year. Looking forward, we see this shifting towards more fixed price revenue, rising to approximately 60% of sales by 2027 as a number of large programs in all 4 of our sectors transition to production.\nProduction program margins are typically a few points higher than development margins. So mix shift can contribute meaningfully to our segment operating margin rate. And we are making good progress on moving programs through development and into production. For example, AARGM-ER completed its fifth consecutive test flight in the second quarter. This program is nearing completion of its development phase and is on track to ramp production volumes next year. And on B-21, we successfully powered on the first flight test aircraft in the quarter, another important milestone in our campaign to achieve for slight and transition to production.\nWe also expect our international business to grow at a double-digit rate over the next few years. Intervenor margin opportunity is global sales become a larger percentage of our mix. In the second quarter, we demonstrated our IBCS solution for 8 potential international customers, reflecting growing demand for this advanced air and missile defense capability. We also signed a memorandum of agreement with Riematel to expand capacity for F-35 center fuselage production in Europe. We expect these 3 drivers to result in improved affordability, even better performance and higher margins. When combined with the strength of our backlog and increasing global demand, these operating margin improvements should provide the foundation for strong future free cash flow growth.\nNow with respect to capital deployment, we're executing a strategy that prioritizes investments to support our business plans and return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year by 8%. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.5 billion to shareholders and are on track to meet our goal of returning more than 100% of free cash flow this year. Overall, the global defense budget outlook and our alignment with customer priorities give us confidence in our growth trajectory. We are focused on margin expansion opportunities and converting this to free cash flow growth to deliver value both for our customers and our shareholders.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Dave, and he'll cover details of the second quarter financial results and updates to our full year outlook.\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter. We remain focused on executing our strategy and believe we're well positioned to grow our top line, earnings and cash flows for years to come. The demand environment continues to be robust, supported by the alignment of our portfolio with our customers' highest priority missions. And as Kathy described, we see a path to expand margins in the second half of this year and beyond as macro pressures ease and we drive efficiencies into our business as it grows and experiences mixed tailwinds.\nNow turning to Q2 results. we generated $10.9 billion of new awards, a higher total than we previously expected. Our book-to-bill was 1.14 and was driven by restricted awards of $5.4 billion. This brings our year-to-date total to $8.6 billion in restricted bookings. Looking forward, we expect a number of production awards in the second half of the year, including the first lot of B-21 LRIP.\nMoving to sales on Slide 4 in our earnings deck. We delivered strong top line growth of 9% in the second quarter, building on the momentum from Q1, as a result of our success in bringing on new employees, incremental improvements in the supply chain and continued backlog strength are still growing at a higher rate, and we've increased our full year guidance. With respect to segment results, all 4 of our businesses grew in the second quarter. Space continues to lead the way with their second consecutive quarter of 17% sales growth as GBSD, NGI and restricted space programs continue to ramp. And Defense Systems sales increased 10% on the strength of their armaments and missile defense franchises. Mission Systems growth of 5% was driven by restricted programs in the Network Information Solutions business, and Aeronautics Systems returned to growth as higher volume on restricted programs outpaced the headwinds on legacy programs as we've anticipated.\nTurning to Slide 5. Segment margins in the second quarter were 11%. Keep in mind that Q2 of last year included over $70 million or 80 basis points of benefit from a land sale and a contract related legal matter. Most importantly, margin dollars improved incrementally from Q1, largely meeting our expectations. Program performance remains strong across the portfolio, as the team does a good job in navigating the lingering disruption from the pandemic and macroeconomic factors we've been discussing. One area of pressure we experienced in the quarter was a $36 million unfavorable adjustment on NASA's habitation and Logistics Outpost program, or HALO, in our Space Systems sector.\nMoving to earnings per share on Slide 6. Diluted EPS in the second quarter were $5.34. This included lower net pension income of roughly $1 per share, partially offset by more favorable returns on marketable securities than in the same period last year.\nSlide 7 highlights the nonoperational pension headwinds we experienced in Q2. On a year-over-year basis, 2023 pension income will be lower for all periods when compared to 2022, but these headwinds are expected to dissipate as we look to 2024. With respect to cash, we generated strong free cash flow in the second quarter of over $600 million, a significant increase compared to the same period last year, in which we had an outflow of $460 million. This improvement was driven by increased billings and timing of collections across the company. We paid roughly $360 million of cash taxes associated with Section 174, and we continue to expect a full year impact of a little over $700 million.\nMoving to 2023 guidance. I'll start with a few updates to our sector estimates, which you can see on Slide 8. Our Space business continues to deliver outstanding sales growth and bookings, demonstrating the strength of its diverse portfolio of capabilities. As a result, we're increasing sales guidance for Space to the high $13 billion range. Remember, as recently as 2019, this business was generating revenue in the mid-$7 billion range. So our guidance this year reflects a fantastic 4-year CAGR of roughly 17%. At Defense Systems, based on the strength of their year-to-date results, we're increasing our full year expectations for this business to the mid- to high $5 billion range. This represents growth in the low single-digit range. There are no changes to our revenue expectations at AS or MS. With respect to margin rates, we're maintaining our expectations for AS, DS and MS, and we're projecting a lower operating margin rate at Space to reflect an increase in new program wins and their first half results.\nAt the company level, this translates to an increase to our sales guidance of $400 million and a growth rate between 5% and 6% for the full year. We're maintaining our expectations for segment operating income dollars. We expect a slightly higher full year tax rate of 17%, and we've reduced our projection for shares outstanding to the mid $152 million to reflect our latest share repurchase expectations. Our EPS outlook continues to assume Q3 closure of the sale of the minority investment for which we increased our full year EPS guidance by $0.40 last quarter. This quarter, we're increasing the lower end of our guidance range by $0.20.\nWe remain on track with our full year outlook for cash and continue to expect to grow our free cash flow to about $3 billion by 2025. This represents a greater than 20% CAGR, driven by the growth of our business and structural tailwinds from cash taxes, lower CapEx and higher CAS recoveries. And over the next 5 years, we see an opportunity to approximately double our current level of free cash flow.\nLastly, we continue to execute our balanced capital deployment plan. This includes investments of over $2.8 billion in R&D and CapEx this year and returning excess capital to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase plans. For the year, we continue to expect to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, including roughly $1.5 billion in repurchases. We also plan to retire $1 billion of notes that mature in August, and we don't have any additional bond maturities until 2025. Overall, the Northrop Grumman team delivered a strong first half of the year. Our business strategy is working, and we're continuing to drive additional growth in sales, earnings and cash. with growing global demand for our portfolio of solutions and solid program performance, we're building long-term value for all our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, let's open up the call for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nVP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2023 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.\nOn the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Northrop Grumman is off to a solid start to the year. Our team is driving industry-leading growth by executing our strategy, meeting the growing global demand from our customers and performing on our programs. As a result, we increased sales by 6% and delivered strong earnings per share in the quarter.\nAdditionally, we're delivering on our capital deployment strategy, which prioritizes investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we continued thoughtful investments in the capability and capacity needed to support our customers' operational initiatives, and we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase plan, returning a total of nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nBased on first quarter results and our continued expectations for growth and strong operational performance, we're reaffirming our 2023 segment guidance. We're increasing our EPS guidance based on our continued confidence in our business outlook and to account for the divestiture of a small minority investment signed this week and expected to close this year. As we look to the long term, increasing breadth to freedom and security persist around the world. Given this, we expect continued support in Congress and the administration for the priorities outlined in the National Defense strategy, which align well with the Northrop Grumman portfolio solution.\nThis support was reaffirmed in the administration's budget request, which was released in March. DoD investment accounts are up by nearly 4% for fiscal year 2024. Northrop Grumman programs continued to be well supported in the budget request, particularly in the areas of strategic deterrence, space, missile defense and advanced computing and communication technologies. The 2024 budget request also reflects the growing need for weapons capability and capacity, with overall funding increasing more than 20% compared to fiscal year 2023 and significant funding increases to major weapon programs, including many of which we provide key components.\n2 of our franchise programs, GBSD and B-21, each fall total investment account funding increased by approximately 10%. The future year defense plan or also prioritizes these programs, with funding projected to nearly double from about $8 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $15 billion in 2028.\nOutside the U.S., the geopolitical landscape remains dynamic. Global defense budgets are increasing as many U.S. outlies modernize and expand their defense capabilities. An important part of our long-term growth strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio to meet these growing global needs, and we continue to make progress in this area.\nIn February, Australia issued a request for AARGM-ER, a high-speed, long-range air-to-ground missile that provides counter air defense capability. Northrop Grumman is a prime contractor for AARGM-ER. And this recent FMS request has a potential value of over $500 million. Australia is one of over a half dozen additional countries expressing interest in this capability.\nIn addition, last month, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the sale of 5 additional E-2D Hawkeye aircraft to Japan. These aircraft, along with the existing backlog, are expected to extend E-2D production well past mid-decade. These international opportunities, together with a broad set of others in IBCS, munitions and sensors, form a strong foundation to grow our international revenue at a double-digit rate over the next several years.\nWith this global demand signal as a backdrop, we've been executing a strategy over the past few years to significantly enhance capabilities and capacity in our weapons portfolio. This portfolio includes components such as electronics, propulsion systems, warheads, infuses as well as missiles, armaments and interceptors. And as a result, we have multiple positions on key programs as both a supplier and a prime contractor.\nLet me share a few examples of progress we've made on this strategy. In the first quarter, we received awards for nearly $350 million for medium- and large-caliber ammunition, Bushmaster cannon and propulsion products for the guided multiple launch rocket system, or GMLRS. In addition, we're developing smarter, more advanced weapons required for future high-end fight with innovations in next-generation strike weapons, high-speed propulsion and smart ammunition.\nOne example of this advancement is the Air Force's Stand-in Attack Weapon, also known as SiAW, a high-speed longer-range air-to-ground missile. During the first quarter, we received an award that takes us to the next phase of this competitive program. To meet our customers' growing demand in this area, we have invested nearly $1 billion since acquiring Orbital ATK, building our capacity for weapons and missile components.\nOur investments significantly increased capacity to produce solid rocket motors supporting our expectation for continued demand for this capability as well as increased capacity for GEM 63 boosters, which supports the growing launch needs of our civil and commercial customers. We're also investing to increase capacity in our missile integration facility located at the Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory in West Virginia. Our newest 113,000 square foot facility is a factory of the future. It is designed to support production of up to 600 strike missiles per year.\nProduction operations will commence with the second lot of low rate initial production for AARGM-ER, adding to other programs that we currently support this complex, including GMLRS Hellfire and Precision Strike Missile, among several others. In addition, we're building a new hypersonic center of excellence in Elkton, Maryland. Later to open this summer, this new production facility is designed to provide full life cycle production for hypersonic weapons from design and development to production and integration using the latest digital engineering and smart manufacturing technologies.\nThe Elkton facility supports programs like hypersonic attack cruise missile, known as and Air launched powered hypersonic weapon that we're producing in partnership with Raytheon Technologies. We're not only a provider of missile systems, we also are a leading provider of missile defense system. This is a rapidly growing area within our business and includes a diverse set of franchise programs.\nOur work in missile defense is now approaching 10% of company revenue, and we see an opportunity to expand that in the years ahead. Our broad end-to-end missile defense portfolio includes sensors, interceptors and command and control systems. One example is our prime contractor role on the next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared, or OPIR Polar segment. This OPIR satellite constellation will operate at a highly elliptical orbit and provide critical strategic missile defense warning capabilities.\nImportantly, we also provide proliferated low earth orbit missile defense capabilities on programs like HBTSS and recent awards for SDA tracking Tranche 1. In addition, we're a prime integrator on next-generation INTERCEPT capabilities, including NGI and glide phase Interceptor. They protect against advanced ballistic and hypersonic missile threats. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we received approval for full rate production for IBCS, an integrated air and missile defense system.\nThis key milestone allows the U.S. Army to set the fielding schedule for IBCS to its Air Defense unit, which will significantly bolster regional defense capabilities. Over the fighter period, domestic deliveries of IBCS units are expected to increase by 40%. And as a reminder, Poland selected IBCS to serve as the centerpiece of its air and missile defense modernization and a number of other allies are also evaluating the system.\nBefore turning the call over to Dave, I'd like to touch on a couple of key program updates, starting with B-21. The program remains on the government's baseline for cost and schedule, and we're continuing to work towards first flight, which will be informed by events and data and remains on track for this year. There are no material changes in our EACs this quarter for the EMD phases of the program, and we continue to expect to receive the first LRIP award later this year.\nThe B-21 program is expected to be the centerpiece of the Air Force's long-range strike portfolio for decades to come. With steady growth in the projected funding across the site, as I outlined, and strong customer demand for its unmatched range, health and survivability, the long-term outlook for the B-21 program remains robust.\nOn GBSD, we achieved 2 key milestones in the quarter. This includes its first full-scale static test fire of the Stage 1 followed rocket motor and the successful completion of a series of wind tunnel tests, which tested the system in both subsonic and hypersonic environments. The comprehensive test campaign validated our digital modeling and simulations and improved design maturity of the missile.\nAnd earlier this month, the James Web-based telescope industry team led by Northrop Grumman won the prestigious trophy for revolutionizing the field of Aster physics. I want to congratulate the team for a pioneering design and unwavering commitment, which were instrumental in winning our industry's highest honor. Overall, our strong start to the year is a clear indicator of this team's performance. We see continued robust demand for our solutions in the U.S. and abroad, and we believe we're well positioned to maintain our industry-leading profitable growth and deliver value creation for shareholders and customers alike. With that said, I'll hand the call over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and our outlook. Dave?\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy noted, our first quarter results provide further evidence that our strategy is working. The strategic investments that we're making in franchise programs and key customer priority areas have positioned us to deliver differentiated growth. Our team continues to do an outstanding job of managing through challenges in the macroeconomic environment. We added substantially to our headcount again this quarter. With respect to the supply chain, we saw signs of modest progress in Q1. We continue to believe that our supply base will experience areas of pressure for some time. And inflation levels have begun to moderate but continue to have a higher base effect on our costs over time, especially on longer-term programs.\nAs we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we've been experiencing impacts from inflation-related cost increases over the past year. We continue to drive efficiencies in our business and partner with our customers in an effort to reduce those impacts going forward.\nNow turning to Q1 results. Bookings of roughly $8 billion, were in line with our expectations, including $3.2 billion in restricted awards. Our backlog remains solid at more than 2x our annual sales, including nearly $24 billion in restricted backlog. At the segment level, our Q1 sales were particularly strong at Space Systems, which grew 17% year-over-year. Aeronautics sales were slightly below the projected full year run rate, primarily due to timing of volume on a few of our large programs.\nMS was up 3% in the quarter, driven by expansion in restricted sales in the Networked Information Solutions business. And Defense Systems sales were up 7%. It's Battle Management and Missile Systems business, several components of which Kathy described earlier, is experiencing particularly strong customer demand, given the global threat environment.\nSegment margins were 10.8% in Q1, in line with our expectations, and included roughly 50 basis points of unfavorable impact associated with higher CAS pension costs that were incorporated into our rates in Q1. Those impacts were spread relatively evenly across the 4 segments. AS margins were down from the first quarter of 2022, primarily because of the $67 million favorable EAC change on the B-21 EMD phase last year. GS margins were about in line with our full year outlook adjusting for the CAS pension impacts.\nMS was slightly under its 2023 projection, due in part to a loss recognized on an unconsolidated joint venture. And Space margins were solid in the quarter with lower EAC adjustments partially offset by the sale of a license to a customer. At the enterprise level, we generated sales volume of $9.3 billion, representing growth of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nConsistent with what we communicated last quarter, our Q1 sales were just over 24% of the midpoint of our full year estimate and were driven by both our hiring trends and supplier deliveries. Our first quarter operating income also grew 6%, due to lower corporate unallocated expense and intangible asset amortization. Our diluted earnings per share were $5.50 and included a headwind of over $1 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022 from lower net pension income.\nThis noncash pension headwind will continue to be a factor in our year-over-year EPS comparisons throughout 2023. And based on current estimates, we expect pension income to begin to increase next year. We also had a few Q1 benefits below the segment line that contributed to our earnings per share.\nFirst, our other corporate unallocated expenses were only $4 million. And while our forecast for corporate unallocated was already weighted toward the second half of the year, this created a timing benefit of roughly $0.10 per share in the quarter. Our marketable securities were favorable in the period and contributed roughly $0.10 to earnings.\nAnd our Q1 estimated tax rate of 15.6%, was lower than our full year forecast, contributing another $0.10 of upside. This was due in part to the benefits of various tax credits recognized in the quarter. Altogether, these items contributed approximately $0.30 of benefit to our Q1 EPS, but they are primarily timing related in nature.\nTurning to cash. As is our typical pattern, we experienced an outflow of cash in the first quarter, due primarily to working capital timing. Capital expenditures totaled $309 million, and our first quarter operating cash flow was a usage of approximately $700 million, consistent with historical trends.\nQ2 last year was a period of cash outflow also, but we're currently forecasting a modest inflow in Q2 this year. In April, we made our first cash tax payment of the year, including the R&D taxes owed associated with Section 174. For the full year, we're projecting over $700 million in cash taxes associated with Section 174, and we continue to be hopeful that Congress will find a way to amend or repeal the law.\nMoving to guidance. Given that the first quarter was roughly in line with our expectations, we have not changed any of our full year segment guidance ranges. We continue to project a book-to-bill ratio just under 1.0x for the year. We expect our second quarter sales to be in line with or slightly higher than Q1 and less than 25% of our full year estimate. We expect many of the timing items I mentioned previously to normalize over the course of the year, including interest expense.\nWith respect to capital deployment, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year via dividends and share repurchases. As Kathy mentioned, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter. And including our open market repurchases, we'll repurchase roughly $720 million of stock in the period. We also raised $2 billion in new notes in the first quarter at attractive rates, which we anticipate using in part to retire the $1 billion of notes that are maturing in Q3.\nOver the long term, we've demonstrated our ability to generate strong and stable cash flows in our underlying business. And based on the durable growth in several areas of our business that Kathy highlighted, we continue to expect our free cash flow to expand at a robust rate, not just through 2025, but through the second half of the decade as well, providing flexibility for our long-term capital deployment plans.\nAnd as we noted in our 10-Q this morning, we just signed an agreement to sell our minority equity investment in a small international business. Closing is expected to occur later this year, most likely in Q3, subject to government approvals and closing conditions. We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.40, consistent with our estimated gain from the transaction and additive to our strong business outlook.\nIn conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year, certain improvements in the macro environment and robust demand signals from our customers domestically and abroad. And with that, let's open up the call for questions."

These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call includes non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChair, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Northrop Grumman team delivered another year of strong performance in 2022, positioning our company for the coming year and beyond. A growing global demand environment and the team's success in capitalizing on competitive opportunities drove exceptional bookings.\nTop line growth accelerated throughout the year, driven in part by improving labor trends. I'll note that we set our sales and EPS guidance ranges at the beginning of 2022, and even in a dynamic macro environment, we navigated the challenges to deliver at or above the high end of those ranges, and then importantly, to deliver capability for our customers.\nThis performance highlights our solid operating execution, our ability to win new business and the alignment of Northrop Grumman's portfolio to our customers' priorities. We enter 2023 with a backlog of more than 2x our annual sales. This strong backlog, along with increasing demand and rising global defense budget supports our expectations for continued growth.\nGiven this and supported by robust headcount growth, we have increased our 2023 sales guidance range from our October outlook. We are projecting solid segment margin performance that takes into consideration inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, consistent with the expectations we outlined on the October call. And we expect a greater than 20% compound annual growth in our multiyear cash flow outlook that supports continued investments in the business and significant returns of capital to shareholders.\nBefore providing more details on our outlook, I'm going to highlight a few notable achievements from the previous year that underscore the tenets of our long-term strategy and illustrate our positioning for the future. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world's most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company.\nIn 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions. We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale.\nFurther, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA's base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon's Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we've made in solid rocket motor capabilities.\nWe also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023. IBCS integrate systems that weren't designed to work together, creating a seamless air and missile defense network and allowing customers to better utilize their defense assets. This capability is needed more than ever to address advanced threats and it's one where we've seen a significant increase in interest across our global customer base with 10 additional countries expressing interest in obtaining this system.\nWe continue to keep our focus on innovating and leveraging our strong position in advanced technology. This includes the development of a new radar for the F-35. This radar is capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats and is compatible with variants of the F-35 aircraft. And we capped off a strong year with the historic unveiling of the B-21 Raider. The B-21 is a multifunctional platform with unmatched range, stealth and survivability, and it will be the backbone of future U.S. air power for decades to come.\nWe continue to perform well on the program and remain on track for first flight later this year. As the program transitions into low rate initial production, we are working to address macroeconomic conditions, especially related to inflation and their impact on material, suppliers and labor. Importantly, I want to highlight that our B-21 unit cost projections remain below the government's independent cost estimates. The program has strong support from the U.S. Air Force, Congress and our suppliers.\nAnd in the words of Secretary Austin from last month's rollout, \"This aircraft is proof of the department's commitment to building advanced capabilities that will fortify America's ability to deter aggression today, and in the future.\" Our 2022 achievements underscore the breadth of our portfolio across a wide range of domains and technologies and the strong performance of the entire Northrop Grumman team.\nAs we look forward, defense budgets are on the rise, and we see our global customers continuing to seek proven solutions to address rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats. We are meeting their urgent needs in areas such as air and missile defense solutions, medium and large caliber ammunitions and armaments, advanced radar capabilities and global surveillance to name just a few. And we are partnering to expand our opportunity set and positioning our international business for future growth. We clearly saw increased demand in 2022, and we continue to expect to grow our international business over the next several years.\nIn the U.S., we are encouraged by the continued strong support for National Security, including overwhelming bipartisan support for a 10% spending increase in the fiscal year 2023 defense budget that was passed in December. Our portfolio and the capabilities we offer are well supported by the administration and Congress. Growing security challenges will test our resolve in ways not seen for a generation, and we are confident this administration and the new Congress will find ways to work together to meet them.\nWe expect the President's fiscal year 2024 budget request to support robust funding for the highest priority capabilities outlined in the National Defense Strategy.\nAnd our strategy has positioned us well. We're clearly maintaining our technology leadership and growing our portfolio of offerings, which is aligned to customer priorities. Another key element of our long-term strategy is keeping a laser focus on performance and driving cost efficiencies throughout the business. The current macroeconomic environment reinforces the importance of doing so.\nAn example of our effort is the implementation of digital solutions across the company. Beyond the benefit of transforming how we design, test and manufacture the next generation of systems, our digital initiatives are streamlining business functions and increasing productivity. We are also optimizing our facilities and consolidating our real estate footprint. Every day, we seek new and innovative ways to drive performance and increased efficiency while remaining agile and meeting our customers' expectations.\nOur capital deployment strategy supports our business strategy. We are investing to not only drive efficiencies but also to allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment. In 2022, we invested over 7% of revenue in R&D and capital expenditures to provide the capability and capacity needed to address the threats of today and tomorrow. We also continue to return cash to shareholders.\nLast year, we increased our dividend by 10%, which was the 19th consecutive increase. And during the year, we delivered over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend and returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases. So looking forward to 2023, we are well positioned for continued growth, and our revenue outlook has improved from the high $37 billion range we shared in October.\nWe now expect sales to be in the range of $38 billion to $38.4 billion, representing about 4.5% growth at the midpoint. Margins are expected to remain solid in the 11.3% to 11.5% range. We are projecting strong free cash flow growth that supports our capital deployment strategy. And we expect to return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in 2023.\nOur backlog, strong recent global demand growth and our ability to deliver products that address an increasingly complex security environment give us confidence in our outlook. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and more on guidance.\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank our team for another year of strong performance in 2022. We won several new franchise programs, delivered industry-leading top line growth and bolstered our talented workforce, with the addition of over 6,000 net employees during the year. I'll spend a few minutes on our fourth quarter and 2022 results and then discuss our future expectations in more detail, including our long-term cash flow projections.\nWe ended the year with nearly $79 billion in backlog, reflecting strong demand for our products and capabilities. We continue to convert our backlog into revenue at an accelerating rate with fourth quarter sales growth of 16%. This was enabled by our ability to continue strong hiring in Q4 as well as a higher volume of material receipts based on the timing of program demand. The team did an outstanding job of working with our supply chain to secure program material. And for the full year, our sales grew to $36.6 billion, representing organic growth of 3% and exceeding our prior expectations. Our operating performance and margins remained solid despite the continued pressures of the macroeconomic environment.\nOur segment operating margin rate was slightly below our expectations at 11.3% in Q4 and 11.6% for the full year due in part to the impacts of inflation, which resulted in a lower level of net earnings adjustments. But margin dollar volume was very strong given the top line outperformance. A positive EAC adjustment in the quarter was on B-21, where we recognized a $66 million pickup on the EMD phase of the program, reflecting our latest assumptions regarding future incentives in that phase.\nContinuing with our Q4 results. Our transaction adjusted earnings per share were $7.50, a 25% increase over the same period in 2021. Higher EPS were driven by robust growth in our segment top and bottom lines as well as a lower effective tax rate. The lower Q4 tax rate was driven by the recognition of an $86 million benefit from the resolution of a legacy Orbital ATK tax return, which we previewed in our guidance last quarter. And corporate unallocated costs were also below our expectations due to lower state taxes as a result of the R&D tax amortization law not being deferred.\nFor the full year, our transaction-adjusted earnings per share were $25.54, well ahead of our guidance range. Now turning to cash. We had an extremely strong fourth quarter, consistent with our historical pattern. For the year, we generated $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow, in line with our expectations. This was inclusive of a full year of cash taxes associated with the R&D tax amortization law as well as our final payment of deferred payroll taxes from the Cares Act legislation.\nMoving to our pension plans. Slide 7 in our earnings deck includes our latest assumptions. After 3 consecutive years of double-digit asset returns, our plans declined by roughly 15% in 2022, in line with market trends. Our FAS discount rate increased roughly 250 basis points to 5.54%, which was the driver of the mark-to-market pension benefit of $1.2 billion reflected in our GAAP results. These factors are also reflected in our latest pension estimates for 2023 to 2025.\nAs we previewed last quarter and updated in our slides today, we're projecting a decline in our noncash net FAS pension income and an increase in our estimated CAS recoveries. In total, our pension plans remain strong. As a result of the higher discount rate, our funded status has improved to nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years.\nNow turning to 2023 guidance. Our revenue expectations have increased from our prior estimates, with the midpoint representing nearly 4.5% growth on top of the strong level in 2022. We expect Space Systems to remain our fastest-growing business. Sales are projected in the mid-$13 billion range, up over $1 billion from 2022 levels, with GBSD and NGI contributing nearly half of the growth and the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. Mission Systems sales are expected in the high $10 billion range, up mid-single digits, driven by restricted programs in our Networked Information Solutions business. And we continue to expect flattish sales at both Aeronautics and Defense Systems. While programs like B-21 and IBCS continue to grow, headwinds remain on legacy platforms as systems are retired. We expect Aeronautics and Defense Systems to return to growth in 2024.\nAnd similar to our cadence in 2022, we expect first quarter sales of approximately 24% of our full year estimate, with sales ramping again throughout the year. With respect to margins, we expect our 2023 segment operating margin rate to be down roughly 20 basis points from 2022 levels. Challenging macroeconomic conditions, including extended lead times in the supply chain and high levels of inflation continue to put temporal pressure on margins. And while higher CAS recoveries provide a modest benefit to our cash flow in the coming years that create pressure in our overhead rates and EACs.\nSimilar in nature to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 when we recognized a favorable impact from lower projected CAS costs, this could lead to an unfavorable margin impact when we update our rates this quarter. We notionally expect this to have a 10 to 20 basis point impact on the full year.\nIn regard to the B-21 program, we expect the 2023 contract award for the first of 5 LRIP lots with the LRIP phase scheduled to run through approximately the end of the decade. We're continuing to work with our customer to address macroeconomic risks and enhance efficiencies in the program. As we've described in our 10-K, we do not believe that a loss on the LRIP phase is probable and therefore, no such loss is reflected in our results or guidance.\nNow turning to our future outlook. We expect our 2023 earnings per share to range between $21.85 and $22.45 based on approximately 153 million weighted shares outstanding. This includes $450 million of net pension income, which represents a $4.30 per share headwind compared to 2022. Partially offsetting this nonoperational headwind is strong growth in segment performance and the lower share count, which adds roughly $0.90 of additional earnings per share and lower purchase intangible amortization largely offsets the higher tax rate.\nMoving to cash. We expect 2023 adjusted free cash flow between $1.85 billion and $2.15 billion, consistent with our prior outlook as adjusted for current R&D tax law. Although we expect discussions to continue on Capitol Hill, our guidance and multiyear outlook are now based on current tax law for all years and do not include any refunds for R&D taxes paid in 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated at $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion in 2023 and a similar level in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. This is driven by investments to support several large new business wins from 2022.\nOur guidance assumes we will not have an extended CR, a breach of the debt ceiling or a prolonged government shutdown as this is our current expectation.\nSlide 12 in our earnings deck provides our long-term cash outlook, which is predicated on continued top line growth in our business generating strong and gradually expanding operating margins and converting those margins into cash. R&D-related cash tax payments should decline by about 20% per year. As I described, CapEx is expected to remain near 4.5% of sales in 2023 and 2024 before starting to decline in 2025.\nAfter investing in our business, we continue to expect to return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we plan to be in the market for new debt issuance soon to support our capital deployment plans including the refinancing of near-term maturities. In summary, 2022 was another successful year for Northrop Grumman, and we continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders.\nAnd with that, we're ready to take your questions."

Welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator today. (Operator Instructions)\nI would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nCorporate VP and Treasurer & VP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2022 conference call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning.\nBefore we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2022 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.\nToday's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.\nOn the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChair, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\nThe Northrop Grumman team delivered another quarter of solid performance. Our top line returned to growth with continued strong execution. Demand for our products remained robust with a book-to-bill ratio of near 1, including a number of key awards in our restricted and Missile Defense portfolios. And we remain on track to deliver strong results for the year, with growth expected to accelerate as we look toward next year.\nTaking a step back for a moment from the quarter, I'd like to start with an update on the global security environment. Earlier this month, the Biden administration released its full version of the National Security Strategy, which is used as a guide for policy and budget decisions.\nThe strategy spotlights the dynamic and challenging threat landscape around the world, and stresses the importance of working with allies, maintaining a strong industrial base and continuing to invest in advanced technology. It also reinforces the triad as a top priority.\nSo it's clear that Northrop Grumman's portfolio continues to be extremely well aligned with the requirements outlined in the National Security Strategy. This is reflected in the administration's fiscal year 2023 budget request, which showed alignment with these priorities and strong support for many of our key programs.\nThroughout this summer, congressional committees marked up the administration's defense budget request, generally increasing the proposed level of funding with the intent of strengthening the country's defense posture and addressing the impacts of inflation.\nBased on these additions, we believe that the ultimate fiscal year '23 base defense budget will be higher than the President's budget request. And as you know, we started off this fiscal year in another continuing resolution, which currently extends to mid-December, and this is factored into our guidance. We are confident in our program funding positions and hopeful that the annual budget will be passed by year-end.\nMeanwhile, global commitments to invest in Defense and National Security capability continue. In Europe, we've seen increased demand for our integrated air and missile defense solutions and precision weapons and advanced ammunition.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, we've seen similar interest in air and missile defense as well as maritime ISR, advanced radar and other mission systems. All this points to a strong demand environment for Northrop Grumman. And we're doing our part by investing in solutions and capacity to address many of our customers' most pressing needs.\nThis year, we expect to invest over $2.5 billion in CapEx and research and development. And as a result, we're winning new business and bolstering our backlog for long-term growth. Our backlog has increased year-to-date in each of our 4 segments and is up nearly 5% overall.\nGiven this, we now expect that our full year 2022 book-to-bill ratio will be over 1, a significant improvement from where we started the year. This increase is attributed not only to the robust defense budget environment, but also a strong competitive win rate.\nThat said, we recognize that our industry and many others are experiencing macroeconomic volatility that we haven't seen in decades. Inflation remains at 40-year highs, lead times have been extended in certain areas of our supply chain, and the labor market shows signs of easing, but it remains tight for critical skills. Our team is tackling these challenges, keeping a focus on our people and performance and driving efficiencies across the business.\nIn the labor market, we've driven improvements in hiring and retention over the past several months, which Dave will describe in more detail. This was instrumental in our return to growth in the third quarter. And it's worth noting that this favorable trend has continued into the fourth quarter as well. This supports our full year 2022 guidance and our outlook for accelerated sales in 2023.\nIn the supply chain, we continue to experience disruptions in delayed deliveries in certain areas of our business, which we have -- they have been a headwind to growth. It's a risk that we're closely monitoring, and we're working with our suppliers to mitigate. But we do anticipate that supply chain challenges will continue in 2023, and this is now reflected into our 2023 outlook.\nElevated inflation levels in both labor and supply chain have persisted more than expected as we came into this year. To address this, we are implementing operational efficiencies and working with many of our customers on program funding and other contract actions to support the health of the defense industrial base. We believe this balanced approach is the best solution to allow continued investment in the capabilities to support our customers' missions.\nWith that said, we see these as temporal challenges and remain committed to driving our segment margin rates higher over time.\nTurning now to the execution of our long-term strategy. One of the key elements of our strategy is a relentless focus on performance. That's why I was particularly pleased to receive the 2022 Deming Cup for operational excellence on behalf of Northrop Grumman earlier this week.\nThe award recognizes our achievements and leadership in creating a culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement across the company. Our customers recognize this commitment and have entrusted us to deliver some of the most technologically advanced next-generation systems and solutions.\nThe B-21 Raider is one such example, and we're excited to unveil the aircraft to the public on December 2. The B-21's outstanding performance can be directly tied to our company's investment in digital tools and facilities, and the incredible U.S. Air Force and Northrop Grumman team, who are developing this sixth-generation platform.\nThe program continues to progress through testing in preparation for first flight in 2023. Last month, we announced a data sharing agreement on B-21, enhancing data access and collaboration across the program, including the launch of a shared environment for the B-21 digital twin. This data sharing agreement enhances our partnership with the Air Force and further demonstrates our digital maturity on the program.\nOur mission systems solutions are another area of our portfolio where innovation is critical to success, where the fast pace of threats and new technologies is driving the need for platforms and sensors to be able to connect with one another, share data and be part of a broader family of systems. In this growing market, we're building on our strong position in sensors, secure communications and networking to compete for and win new opportunities.\nFor example, last month, we were selected to be a member of the Air Force's ABMS Digital Infrastructure Consortium. And we're also seeing interest from global customers including the Australian Defense Force where we recently demonstrated a product solution with robust C2 functionality to link sensors and effectors across domains.\nAnother significant area of focus for the U.S. and our allies is the modernization of missile defense solutions to address current and future missile threats. We continue to strengthen our position in this area with a $1.3 billion Ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon System award in the third quarter. This award builds on our missile defense portfolio and helps our customers defend against intermediate and intercontinental missile attacks.\nAnd turning to our weapons business. I'm pleased to share that we've now delivered more than 100,000 Precision Guidance Kits to the U.S. Army. These projectiles provide enhanced precision to artillery units and come embedded with built-in safety features. We've exceeded requirements on both accuracy and reliability with these upgrades.\nAnd one last area that I'll highlight is hypersonics, where we continue to win new competitive business. Last month, the Air Force selected our Raytheon and Northrop Grumman team to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile also known as HACM. HACM builds on our scramjet propulsion technology and ushers in a new era of faster, more survivable weapons.\nThis program is one of several hypersonic opportunities within our portfolio. We're approaching this market as both a prime and a sub, bringing our expertise in high-speed propulsion, survival navigation and targeting capabilities, and systems integration to multiple solutions.\nThese are just a few examples of markets where we continue to grow our business by delivering the products and solutions that our customers want and need, while also building long-term value for our shareholders.\nSo now, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will provide more color on our Q3 results and touch on our expectations for 2023. Dave?\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone.\nAs you heard from Kathy, we delivered solid results across all key metrics in Q3. We're reaching an inflection point in our sales growth, driven by the strength in the demand environment, our new business performance and our success in hiring and retaining employees. We had another strong quarter for bookings with roughly $8.7 billion in awards. This contributed to a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 and an increase in our full year book-to-bill expectations.\nOur Q3 top line results of roughly $9 billion, were up sequentially from Q2, and up about 3% compared with the third quarter of 2021. This acceleration has been driven by our positive hiring trends. We added nearly 1,000 net new employees in Q2, and we added an additional 2,700-plus people in Q3. With continued positive hiring and retention results, we've improved our labor-driven sales visibility, so the supply base is now the key to achieving our full year sales outlook.\nWe're seeing temporal challenges in the supply chain, as are most others, including longer lead times and higher costs in some areas. Our suppliers are a critical element of the Defense Industrial Base and we're closely monitoring small businesses, who are the most vulnerable to the challenges of this macroeconomic environment, particularly inflation. We're encouraged by recent comments from Congress on this topic, and we're actively working with our customers to help mitigate inflationary effects on our contracts, including those being felt by our suppliers.\nOur program execution remained solid in the quarter, with segment margins of 11.2%, reflecting lower net EAC adjustments due in part to the inflationary pressures that we've noted. As costs have remained elevated, we've captured our latest estimates of inflation and opportunities to mitigate it in our EACs. This had a downward effect on our margins in Q3. But year-to-date, our segment margins are 11.7%, and we continue to expect the full year rate to be in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%.\nTurning to earnings per share. Our diluted EPS in the quarter were $5.89. The year-over-year earnings decline was driven by nonoperational factors, including lower net pension income, unfavorable returns on our marketable securities, and an insurance settlement for $60 million that was recognized in the third quarter of 2021. Together, these items represented roughly $0.85 of year-over-year EPS headwinds, but as I pointed out, our businesses continue to execute very well in a complex environment.\nIn terms of cash, we generated outstanding operational cash flows in the third quarter of over $1.3 billion, and we expect Q4 to be even better. This is consistent with our historical pattern of collections and disbursements. In the quarter, we made our third cash tax payment associated with the R&D amortization law of approximately $220 million, and we continue to expect roughly $1 billion in cash tax payments related to R&D for the full year.\nThrough the end of Q3, we completed over $1 billion in share repurchases, and we're on track for an additional $500 million in the fourth quarter.\nNow moving to 2022 guidance. We have not changed our sales, earnings or cash outlooks. The foundation for our strong financial performance starts with the continued demand we're seeing for our products. We're increasing our expectation for book-to-bill again this quarter to greater than 1x, which is a significant improvement from our original expectation. Our team has done an outstanding job of serving as a trusted partner to our customers in winning new business.\nWe're maintaining our original guidance for the top line. And based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect our full year sales to be around the low end of the range, consistent with the trends we described last quarter. Our full year outlook implies Q4 sales of roughly $9.6 billion, which represents excellent sequential and year-over-year growth. As we've noted throughout the year, we anticipate that Q4 will include a strong volume of material receipts across each of our four segments.\nWe're also maintaining our guidance for the bottom line, including segment OM rate and earnings per share. Given that 2022 sales volume will be around the low end of the range, we expect EPS to be near the low end of its range also.\nWithin our earnings outlook, we're accounting for continued year-to-date pressure on our marketable securities portfolio, offset by an anticipated federal tax rate benefit in Q4. Our marketable securities are down nearly $100 million in 2022, which represents about $0.50 of earnings per share pressure.\nBut on the income tax line, we've lowered our effective rate expectation from 17% to 15.5%, reflecting progress in resolving matters related to historical filings in one of our businesses.\nWe currently expect those matters to be concluded in Q4, resulting in about $0.50 of EPS benefit that offsets the marketable securities pressure. It's also possible that the tax item could be resolved in Q1, which would shift the benefit from 2022 into 2023.\nMoving to cash flows. While we remain optimistic that Congress will repeal or defer the R&D amortization law, we have focused our free cash flow guidance this year on the current tax laws scenario, which is unchanged from last quarter. If the law is deferred or repealed in Q4, we would expect a one-time spike in state taxes recognized in corporate unallocated expense, as well as a cash refund in 2023. Operationally, we're very pleased with the progress we made in cash flows in Q3, bolstering our confidence in the full year outlook.\nNext, I'd like to take a few moments to describe the outlook for our pension plans. Most importantly, our current funded status remains strong and roughly unchanged year-to-date, and the cash flow implications of CAS changes over the next several years provide a modest benefit. The GAAP income statement effects I'll describe today are noncash in nature.\nYear-to-date, our plans have experienced double-digit negative returns and discount rates have risen nearly 250 basis points. This combination of results will affect our GAAP earnings in future years. So I'd like to take a moment to discuss what our 2023 net pension income would look like under various scenarios.\nIn January, we provided a sensitivity table in our earnings call deck related to changes in discount rates and asset returns on our nonservice FAS pension income. Based on the high level of volatility, the pension funds have experienced so far this year, I wanted to provide a grid of potential outcomes that also incorporates FAS service expense and CAS costs, which can be found on Slide 9 of our presentation today.\nTo help calibrate you to this slide, we've highlighted the 2023 pension estimates provided in January, which were based on expected 2022 asset returns of 7.5%, and a year-end discount rate of roughly 3%.\nGiven the year-to-date asset returns and discount rates at the end of Q3, we would expect significantly lower net FAS pension income in 2023, currently in the range of over $900 million less than our previous projection. As I've described, this lower net FAS pension income is noncash in nature. Over time, higher CAS recoveries would lead to modestly higher cash flow related to our pension.\nI also wanted to provide additional insights on our high-level financial outlook for 2023. Note that this is predicated on our current expectations regarding the macro environment. As Kathy said, we expect strong demand to continue into 2023. In terms of hiring and retention trends, as I've now shared a few times, we've seen improvements since the beginning of 2022, and we anticipate that this will remain consistent next year.\nIn the supply chain, where the environment has remained challenging with various delays and disruptions, we project that those challenges will continue throughout 2023. And with regard to inflation, which has been more persistent in '22 than originally expected, our projections incorporate gradual easing based on the latest industry labor and material indices.\nAs Kathy described, we continue to expect our sales growth to accelerate next year, building on the momentum we've driven in 2022. In total, we expect sales growth in the 4% to 5% range. Based on our low $36 billion expectation for 2022, that would put us in a high $37 billion range for 2023.\nWithin our segments, we continue to expect Space to remain our fastest-growing business, with sales growing by another $1 billion over 2022. We expect strong sales growth in MS in the mid-single-digit range. And we anticipate sales at AS and DS to be flattish compared with their latest 2022 levels.\nWe also expect to generate solid segment margin rates. As I've described, net EAC improvements are likely to be lighter than usual until inflation begins to normalize. So we'd expect our segment OM rate, which would otherwise have been projected in the high 11% range next year, to be between the mid-11% and the high 11%.\nWith regard to earnings, pension income will be a noncash headwind as quantified on Slide 9. But excluding pension, we expect our earnings per share to grow faster than sales in 2023, driven by continued strong execution and a lower share count.\nWe expect our tax rate to return to its more normal level of around 17% next year. And we continue to generate excellent cash flows with our prior 3-year cash outlook intact and another year of free cash flow growth expected in 2025.\nWe anticipate modest increases to our prior CapEx projections based on the strength of this year's new business wins and backlog growth, offset by corresponding improvements in operating cash flows.\nWe're very proud of the performance we've delivered this year in a continued challenging environment, and we're pleased with our projected growth acceleration in the second half of 2022 and in 2023. With our multiyear cash flow outlook intact, we're looking forward to continuing to create value for our customers and shareholders.\nAnd with that, we're ready for your questions."

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Victor, and I will be your operator today.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd Ernst\n\nCorporate VP and Treasurer & VP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThank you, Victor, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted to our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including 2022 guidance and beyond, including our outlooks reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and in our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.\nOn the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and David Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChair, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us.\nI'd like to start today's call by highlighting the James Webb Space Telescope and the incredible images released just a few weeks ago. This extraordinary telescope represents countless Northrop Grumman engineers, technicians, scientists and cross-functional teams working in partnership with NASA for over two decades. In addition to leading the industry team, we designed and built the deployable sun shield, provided the spacecraft, developed the observatory subsystems and integrated the total system. The advanced technology we've created and the images it captures will inspire the next generation of innovators and scientists and we believe will be one of Webb's many legacies. Webb exemplifies the defining characteristic of our business strategy to develop and produce innovative technology solutions to address our customers' toughest challenges.\nThis strategy differentiates us and aligns our portfolio with our customers' priorities. And as a result, we strengthened our position in the market. As a reminder, the 4 core focus areas of our strategy are technology leadership, sustainably and profitably growing our business, keeping a laser focus on performance and deploying capital in value creating ways. This strategy continues to yield results.\nIn the second quarter, we saw strong demand across our businesses with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.48, driven by awards for F-35, GEM 63 and restricted programs. All of our businesses had a book-to-bill ratio above 1 in the quarter, driving a 6% sequential increase in our backlog, which now totals $80 billion. Given this backlog growth and our continued alignment to customers' budgets and priorities, we are even more confident we can accelerate our revenue in 2023 from the low single digits we're guiding this year.\nIn the quarter, we did experience certain challenges from the broader macroeconomic environment, including a tight labor market and supply chain delays, which impacted sales timing. However, we're pleased with the progress our team continues to make in addressing these challenges and hiring trends improved as we progressed through the second quarter, laying the foundation for sales growth in the second half of the year.\nAs our business grows, we remain focused on performance and driving cost efficiencies across the business. This continued focus contributed to another quarter of solid margin performance. Our segment OM rate was a robust 12.2% in Q2 and stands at 12% year-to-date. Dave will cover further details of our quarterly results and guidance update momentarily, but first, I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter. The technology developed for James Webb is one example of Northrop Grumman's innovation.\nAnother example is how we are using technology to produce innovative and affordable solutions for our customers. To that end, we're investing in digital design capabilities and advanced manufacturing facilities. In close partnership with our customers, we are digitally transforming how we design, test and manufacture the next generation of systems. And you've heard our customers acknowledge the results, particularly with some of the largest programs, including B-21 and GBSD. We are marrying our world-class engineering talent with the latest digital tools, machine learning and agile principles.\nAnd as we announced this quarter, we are also investing in factories of the future, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in West Virginia, which will incorporate the latest in digital manufacturing, automation and modular work cells. Once operational in 2024, this facility will support production of up to 600 strike missiles per year, optimizing quality and reducing cost and cycle time as well as bolstering tactical weapon supply chain capacity for our customers.\nFor the last few years, we've taken an enterprise-wide approach in mission-focused areas that are aligned with our customers' priorities. These are areas where we see opportunity to leverage our technology know-how and our domain expertise and tie capabilities from across our businesses.\nToday, I want to highlight a few of them and the related results we've seen so far this year. One example of this is in National Security Space. Our customers have made it clear that space underpins many missions vital to our national security. And we recognize that we need to think about space differently, as a rapidly evolving contested domain.\nGiven this, our focus is on providing space-based offerings that include a mix of exquisite solutions in combination with proliferated constellations of low earth orbit satellites, also known as LEOs, which together create a more resilient architecture. We've recently seen the benefits of this approach. For example, after the close of the second quarter, we received a $617 million contract for the SDA Tracking Layer, which is a LEO constellation of 14 satellites designed to provide global warning, tracking and targeting of advanced missile threats, including hypersonic missiles. This builds on the SDA Transport Layer contract we were awarded in February, which is also a LEO constellation of 42 satellites, providing resilience, low latency, high volume data transport in support of U.S. military missions around the world.\nIn addition to these, we booked another $700 million in Q2 in restricted space awards and now have $11.3 billion of restricted space backlog. We continue to see the national security space area as one of the strongest growth drivers for our company.\nAnother focus area where we are pulling capability and expertise from across the portfolio is Missile Defense and counter hypersonics. In the second quarter, we were awarded a contract from the Missile Defense Agency to continue development of the Glide Phase Interceptor program. GPI will play a central role in ensuring the United States maintains the most reliable and advanced missile defense systems capable of outpacing and defeating evolving missile threats.\nThis complements our missile defense modernization work already underway on NGI, HBTSS and IBCS. We have also been supporting international customers to modernize their missile defense systems. For example, last week, we delivered the first of the six production IBCS engagement operation centers for Poland's medium-range air and missile defense system. Our capital deployment approach is also an important part of the strategy I just laid out for you.\nOur first priority is to invest in executing our business strategy. By investing in our factories, digital design tools and our people who are a key source of our technology leadership, we are creating long-term sustainable value. We also remain committed to returning at least 100% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. In the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 10%, marking our 19th consecutive annual increase.\nOur new quarterly dividend will be nearly double the level we paid in the beginning of 2017. We are also returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases, and we continue to target at least $1.5 billion in repurchases this year.\nBefore Dave shares more details about our financial results, I'd like to briefly talk about the defense demand environment. We've seen a fundamental shift in global commitment of resources for defense and national security, particularly in Europe. Just this year, we've seen Finland and Sweden progress their membership in NATO and many European countries increase or state their plans to increase their defense budget.\nThe geopolitical environment has highlighted an increased requirement for defense and deterrence. In the U.S., this has also resulted in strong bipartisan support for defense spending. Recently, the Congressional Armed Services Committees marked up their version of the FY '23 defense bill with both providing bipartisan support for further increases in defense spending above the President's budget. For Northrop Grumman, the U.S. FY '23 base defense budget request included strong support for key programs like B-21, GBSD, NGI, IBCS, next-generation OPIR and Triton. And there is an opportunity for additional funding for G/ATOR, E-2D, F-35 and F-18 that we've seen in proposed plus-ups from Congress.\nBut I will note that as has become the norm in recent years, there is a high probability of starting the fiscal year on a CR, so we have anticipated this in our outlook for 2022. The budget is a strong reflection of the alignment of our company with our customers and reinforces my confidence that we are well positioned for this environment.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave, and then I'll have a few closing remarks before we turn to Q&A. Dave?\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone.\nOverall, this was another solid quarter with similar themes to Q1. Near-term supply side pressures and a tight labor market have persisted but the demand environment continues to be quite strong with outstanding awards and backlog growth, driven by alignment with our customers' highest priorities, setting the stage for longer-term success.\nWe generated $13 billion of new awards in the second quarter, a higher volume than we had expected due to excellent competitive wins and timing of a few large awards, including the latest F-35 block in our Aeronautics Sector. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is now 1.22. As a result of our strong bookings, we now expect award volume to be approximately equal to sales for the full year, higher than our previous projections.\nWhile these new business metrics position us for growth going forward, our Q2 sales of $8.8 billion and first half sales in total came in slightly below our expectations as we continue to manage through global supply chain and labor market challenges.\nThese first half results and current trends point toward a full year sales outlook near the low end of our guidance range, with Q3 sales slightly over $9 billion and Q4 in the mid-$9 billions. These figures represent much stronger year-over-year growth in the second half than the first, requiring continued expansion in headcount and material receipts. In Q2, we drove incremental improvements in hiring as the quarter progressed, adding nearly 1,000 net employees in Q2 after being down slightly in Q1.\nOur material receipts forecast is also weighted toward the second half of the year based on timing of program demand. These factors, along with our growing backlog, provides the foundation for faster revenue growth rates in the second half of the year, and we expect that momentum to continue into 2023.\nEven with temporal top line headwinds, our execution remained strong in the quarter. Segment margins were 12.2%, in line with the high level from Q2 of last year. Driving cost efficiencies and keeping a laser focus on performance are key elements of our strategy. These will be particularly important efforts in a higher inflationary environment than we've experienced in recent years. It starts by negotiating good business terms and delivering strong program performance, but it doesn't end there.\nIt also includes driving affordability in our rates, having a disciplined approach to risk management and optimizing our cost structure. For example, in the quarter, we sold a property in Bethpage, New York and recognized a $38 million gain.\nContinuing with our Q2 results, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $6.06, down 6% compared to the second quarter of last year. EPS was lower, largely due to non-operational items. Unfavorable returns on our marketable securities and lower net pension income contributed headwinds of $0.60 compared to Q2 of last year. And while our 17.7% tax rate was lower than last year, it was above Q1 and our full year expectation for 2022.\nTurning to full year guidance. I'll start with a few updates to our sector estimates. Our Space business continues to deliver excellent sales growth and bookings, including another quarter of record backlog, demonstrating the diversity of capabilities that we bring to market. As a result, we're again increasing its sales guidance to the high $11 billion range. At DS, we're tweaking our full year expectations to the mid-$5 billions based on a slower ramp on certain programs as well as broader staffing challenges.\nFor operating margin rate, we are increasing our estimates at AS, DS and MS based on their strong year-to-date results. Offsetting these increases are a reduction in the Space OM rate to approximately 10% based on better-than-expected success in winning new development programs.\nAnd at the company level, we're maintaining our full year guidance ranges for sales, segment margin rate, EPS and cash. Within those ranges, we currently expect that any softness in sales is likely to be offset by margin strength.\nEmbedded in our earnings per share outlook are a few moving pieces. First, our corporate unallocated costs are now projected to be $210 million, down $60 million from our prior estimates. This is due to favorable state tax trends and other lower corporate expenses. We're also projecting modestly lower net interest expense. Offsetting these benefits is an unfavorable impact from our marketable securities that we've experienced year-to-date. There are no incremental mark-to-market impacts assumed in our guidance for the second half of the year.\nAs we noted last quarter regarding corporate unallocated costs, we continue to project a one-time spike in state taxes recognized in the quarter in which the R&D tax amortization law is deferred. With respect to cash, second quarter free cash flow was an outflow of $460 million. Absent the cash taxes paid associated with R&D amortization, our free cash flow would have been roughly breakeven compared with the high hundreds of millions of dollars in an average Q2. A good portion of this delta was due to several large program collections expected toward the end of Q2 that were instead collected in Q3, including about $300 million collected on the first working day of July.\nThe seasonality of our collections and disbursements is such that the second half of the year is expected to generate much stronger cash flows than the first. But as always, we'll need to keep our focus on execution and drive further working capital efficiencies to offset any ongoing timing issues and achieve our outlook. Our guidance continues to include two scenarios: one based on current tax law and a deferral scenario predicated on receiving refunds for payments made to date.\nNext, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our pension plans. Last quarter, I mentioned that while our pension plans contribute a component of our GAAP earnings, the FAS/CAS income is non-operational and not something we consider when assessing the company's performance. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an illustration of the pension headwind on GAAP earnings that we've experienced so far this year.\nAs we look toward next year, we would expect this headwind to grow based on recent volatility in the financial markets. Year-to-date, our asset performance has been below our long-term expected rate of return and discount rates have had a historic rise. Of course, our pension plans aren't unique in experiencing these macroeconomic trends. If we snap the line at quarter end, these market conditions would translate to significantly lower net pension income going forward, primarily in the nonoperating FAS pension line. Partially offsetting this GAAP earnings headwind would be a modest increase in projected CAS recoveries, but our required cash contributions would remain very low for the next several years, and our funded status remains healthy at over 96%.\nSo while the GAAP earnings impact could be a headwind, from a cash or economic perspective, the changes would be modestly favorable. A lot can change in the financial markets over the course of the year, so we'll wait to provide more specific multiyear projections until later in the year. I'd point you to the pension sensitivity table that we provided in our January earnings deck for your modeling purposes.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Kathy.\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChair, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave. So in summary, demand remains robust, and we saw outstanding bookings and backlog growth in the quarter and year-to-date. This demand is creating momentum that supports our expectation for accelerating growth for the remainder of this year and into next. Additionally, our capital deployment strategy is aimed at supporting long-term growth and creating value for our shareholders. We believe the investments we are making today in digital tools and factories of the future are already enabling stronger program performance and contributing to our operating results.\nSo I'm incredibly proud of the Northrop Grumman team as we execute our strategy and position the company for long-term success. So with that, we're ready for Q&A."

Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We've seen significant changes to the geopolitical landscape since our last earnings call. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has consequences for the stability of the region in addition to creating a profound humanitarian crisis. Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and protect their way of life.\nThrough the Northrop Grumman Foundation, we are committing aid to help the people of Ukraine, including matching our employees' personal donations to select charitable organizations. This situation underscores the importance of having strong defensive capabilities to deter broader aggression and contain global conflicts.\nAt Northrop Grumman, we've worked to ensure our country and its allies have these deterrent capabilities. Modern deterrence depends on our customers' ability to maintain advantage over competitors in multiple domains from undersea to space and cyberspace and every domain in between. Northrop Grumman continues to demonstrate our ability to bring deterrent solutions to a more complicated world through unique capabilities in areas such as stealth, cyber, space, computing, propulsion and communications to name a few. I'll talk more specifically about our capabilities and our strategy in a few moments. But first, let's address the budget trends we see in light of this threat environment.\nIn the U.S., there is bipartisan support for increasing defense budgets. Congress finalized the fiscal year 2022 defense appropriations in March, and the administration has since issued the fiscal year 2023 defense budget request. Both of these base budgets showed solid 4% to 5% top line growth with additional potential in supplemental funding. Based on initial indications from Congress, the final fiscal year 2023 appropriation could be even higher than the initial request as Congress looks to address the evolving threat landscape, but also to offset inflationary pressures.\nCurrently, the fiscal year 2023 budget request includes a 4% increase in the investment accounts. The main driver behind this increase is a 9% increase in R&D to fund development of critical capabilities, particularly in space and deterrence. Space continues to be one of the fastest-growing defense budget areas with a 30%-plus year-over-year increase. The request also fully funds modernization of the strategic deterrent, including initial production funding for B-21 as well as significant year-over-year increase in development funding for GBSD.\nAnd NASA budgets are also growing in support of a new era of space exploration. The FY '23 budget request includes an 8% increase over FY '22, including funding ongoing programs such as Artemis and new initiatives for Moon to Mars efforts. And globally, there is an ongoing paradigm shift regarding national security and several allies have pledged to increase defense spending as a result. We stand ready to support them in achieving their national security objectives as well.\nWith the budget environment as context, I'll take a few minutes to step back and frame our business strategy. Our fundamental goal is to be the leading technology company, enabling the U.S. and its allies to protect freedom, deter conflict and sustain our planet. Our business strategy, which we've been executing for several years is focused on four core areas. First, is maintaining technology leadership and delivering innovative and affordable solutions with speed. Next is sustainably and profitably growing our business in our customers' highest priority missions while maintaining contracting discipline. Third is keeping a laser focus on performance and driving cost efficiencies. And finally, we are focused on deploying our capital in value-creating ways for our customers and investors.\nThis strategy has created strong alignment with our customer priorities and strengthened our portfolio position. As we sit here today, we expect this will enable us to accelerate our revenue growth rate in 2023 from the low single digits in our 2022 guidance. By 2024, we also expect that by growing our business and delivering strong operational performance, we will be able to drive our segment operating margin rate to approximately 12%. And we continue to expect to grow our transaction-adjusted free cash flow at a double-digit CAGR through this period.\nFrom a capital deployment perspective, investing in our business to support this growth outlook remains our top priority. After making such investments, we are targeting a return of at least 100% of our free cash flow to investors in 2022. Underlying these performance goals and expectations is our position in several priority growth areas for our customers.\nOur role in supporting deterrents across all domains is in direct alignment to the needs of today's changing global national security environment. For nearly 7 decades, the U.S. has successfully mitigated the risk of broader global conflict through strategic deterrence. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor on two of the three current deterrence modernization programs.\nFor the B-21 program, the Air Force confirmed that the first aircraft has entered the ground test phase, paving the way for first flight, and there are five additional test aircraft in various stages of assembly. This progress is partly enabled by our digital design capabilities and advanced manufacturing technologies, which reduce risk ahead of the aircraft's first flight. And looking forward, we expect sales on the B-21 program to grow as the EMD phase continues, and we progress into low-rate initial production. This assumption underpins our expectations for Aeronautics revenue to be flat next year and return to growth in 2024.\nFor GBSD, we remain on schedule. The program is expected to continue to ramp over the next couple of years as we execute on the $13 billion EMD contract with nearly [$1.9 billion] in expected revenue in 2022. We still expect the program to enter production in the 2026 time frame with initial operating capability planned for 2029. GBSD production is expected to be a material growth driver in the middle of the decade as is reflected in the President's budget.\nIn addition, our Space business continues to experience rapid growth as our customers rearchitect their space-based capabilities. This growth is in response to adversaries developing more sophisticated weapons, the need for more capable missile defense warning systems as well as the migration of some airborne missions to the space domain.\nIn the first quarter, we've received several new awards that showcase the breadth of our Space portfolio and our ability to compete and win in various domains, including ground systems and proliferated LEO constellations. These awards build on our significant backlog and positions our Space business for expected double-digit growth once again this year.\nNotable wins in this quarter included nearly $700 million award for 42 satellites in low-Earth orbit that provide high-speed, low-latency communications for the Space Development Agency's transport layer. And we won a $340 million contract for Deep-Space Advanced Radar Capability, or DARC, that dramatically improves situational awareness, particularly in geosynchronous orbit. And in Q2, we anticipate an approximately $2 billion award from ULA to provide GEM 63 motors for launch services, including in support of Amazon's Project Kuiper.\nAnother area where we see meaningful future growth opportunities is in Mission Systems, particularly our network information solutions business, which at its core is a communications and processing business. In this area, we have proven technology leadership in connecting and linking military systems with a broad portfolio of products, including networking systems and radios and cyber computing and AI capabilities. We're seeing a rapid evolution in this area with ambitious goals from our customers to field open, distributed, secure networks that are more survivable. Initiatives like JADC2 are providing demand for our existing platform-agnostic solutions as well as providing opportunities for new technologies we are developing.\nAnd we are creating partnerships like the 5G partnership with AT&T that we announced this month to strengthen our competitive position. We believe this communications business will be the fastest-growing area of MS over the next couple of years.\nGiven all that I've just outlined, you can see that our portfolio is aligned to the evolving national security environment and priority areas for our customers. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver compelling solutions in this environment.\nUltimately, executing on our strategy depends on having the right culture and people. This is one of the reasons we focus on remaining an industry leader in ESG. I encourage you to look at our annual sustainability report, which we published in March. It provides insights to our progressive governance structure, our culture, our commitment to ethics, diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental sustainability.\nAs we shared in this year's report, we are committing to net zero emissions in our operations by 2035. We also published our first TCFD report, which provides additional transparency around our approach to managing the climate-related risks and opportunities across our business.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Dave to provide more detail on our results and guidance, and then we'll move on to Q&A. Dave?\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter was a strong start to the year. We generated more bookings than we've been expecting, including competitive wins on several new programs. Our robust backlog of $76 billion continues to be over 2x our annual sales and provides the foundation for future growth. First quarter sales totaled $8.8 billion, down 2% organically and up sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021. Q1 sales represented about 24% of our full year guidance, in line with our prior projection.\nWe experienced some temporal COVID-related productivity and volume impacts to start the year, which receded as the quarter progressed. Continued tightness in the broader labor market represents a challenge that we're working hard to mitigate as we ramp on large contracts and address strong market demand for our capabilities. We continue to make progress on this front and are pleased with the trajectory that we're on.\nOur execution remains solid in the quarter. We delivered a segment operating margin rate of 11.8%, in line with the midpoint of our full year guidance. And we made progress on several elements of our long-term cost efficiency strategy. At the program level, net EAC results varied across sectors as is common in any given quarter. One of the positive EAC changes in Q1 was a $67 million favorable adjustment on the B-21 program related to performance incentives.\nIn addition to what Kathy noted, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide a bit more color on this franchise program. B-21 is currently in its cost type EMD phase with a variety of incentive fees for which we accrue based on anticipated achievement. Our projections for certain EMD incentives improved in Q1, leading to the favorable EAC adjustment. We are in a critical integration and test portion of the EMD phase this year and we continue to focus on production efficiencies. The low-rate initial production, or LRIP phase, will begin over the next year and run in parallel with EMD for a period of time. LRIP for B-21 is fixed price, and we expect to recognize revenue for the LRIP lots separately from EMD. The LRIP units were priced as part of our original bid for the program.\nThe full rate production phase, or FRP, has yet to be negotiated and includes the majority of the aircraft volume in the program of record. Based on our current projections, which run roughly through the end of this decade, we continue to expect production to be priced and profitably executed within the program's average procurement unit cost target.\nNow turning back to our Q1 results. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $6.10, reflecting our strong segment performance. Keep in mind, we had a headwind of roughly $0.46, resulting from lower CAS pension costs in our overhead rates that we booked in the first quarter of last year. In aggregate, our transaction-adjusted earnings per share were down 7% compared to Q1 2021, primarily due to nonoperational factors, such as lower net FAS/CAS pension and the performance of marketable securities. It's worth noting that the after-tax net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in Q1 was nearly $250 million, representing $1.58 of earnings per share. This was $40 million lower than Q1 a year ago and a $0.19 EPS headwind. We expect similar impacts in each of the remaining quarters in 2022. That total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment primarily reflects the actuarial gains and losses in our pension plans, and is not something we consider when assessing the company's operating performance.\nMoving to 2022 guidance. We have minimal changes. We're increasing the sales guidance for our Space business due to continued strong momentum and recent capture of new awards, as Kathy outlined. We now estimate sales in the mid- to high $11 billion range which would result in another year of double-digit sales growth.\nAt Defense Systems, we are adjusting our estimate to the mid- to high $5 billion range to reflect a lower first quarter, particularly on some of our international training programs. These two adjustments offset each other, and our full year company level sales guidance is unchanged.\nWith respect to our quarterly sales profile, we expect Q2 sales to be between 24% and 25% of our full year guidance midpoint with our expectation near the middle of that range. From there, we expect accelerating year-over-year growth in the second half of the year.\nNext, I wanted to take a moment to talk about cash. First quarter transaction-adjusted free cash flow was consistent with our expectations and in line with our historical seasonal trends. The decrease compared to the first quarter of 2021 reflects timing of collections and disbursements and our full year guidance is unchanged.\nAfter the quarter ended, we made our first cash tax payment of the year, which included the projected effect of current R&D tax law. Our next estimated tax payment is due June 15. We continue to project that cash taxes would be about $1 billion higher for the full year should the current law remain in effect. But we remain optimistic that we will see it deferred or eliminated given the broad bipartisan support for doing so.\nOur base case assumption for cash flow and P&L continues to be that Section 174 R&D tax law will be changed. If and when that happens, we would expect to file for any appropriate refunds of taxes paid and also recognize a spike in corporate unallocated cost in that quarter associated with the reversal of the deferred state tax asset that had been building year-to-date. I'd note that we've already incorporated these items in our full year EPS guidance.\nWe remain committed to providing excellent shareholder returns with at least $1.5 billion in share repurchases targeted for this year on top of a healthy competitive dividend. As Kathy mentioned, in aggregate, we expect to return at least 100% of our 2022 transaction-adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.\nOver time, we expect the cash on our balance sheet at a typical year-end to be roughly $2 billion, which would continue to provide flexibility and liquidity. Our capital deployment strategy also prioritizes investing in our business. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2022 to be in line with 2021 levels. And later today, we will file an S-4 with the SEC as the final step of the obligor exchange process that we executed last summer on certain debt instruments.\nOverall, we're pleased with our first quarter results and achievements as we continue to build a strong foundation to accelerate growth and deliver on our long-term value creation strategy.\nAnd with that, we'll open your call up for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Natalia, and I will be your operator today. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\n\nTodd B. Ernst\n\nCorporate VP and Treasurer & VP of IR, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThank you, Natalia, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. We'll refer this morning to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page.\nBut before we start, I'd just like to go through a couple of comments here. The matters discussed on today's call, including 2022 guidance and beyond, including our outlooks reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws.

And on today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another year of solid operating performance in 2021 and positioned our business for continued growth in 2022. We are executing our strategy, which is to grow the business today and into the future, maintain excellent performance and reduce costs to deliver strong margin rates and deploy our capital to create value. We made significant progress in executing this strategy again in 2021.\nOur organic sales growth for the year was 3%. Our segment operating margin was an exceptionally strong, 11.8%, which increased 40 basis points compared to 2020 with performance more than offsetting mixed and COVID-related headwinds.\nWe grew our transaction adjusted EPS by 8% and generated a $3.1 billion of transaction adjusted free cash flow. Regarding capital deployment, we returned a record $4.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including a $500 million accelerated share repurchase that we announced in November of 2021.\nWe strengthened our balance sheet, retiring over $2.2 billion of debt during the year and achieving an increased credit rating in the process. And we continue to invest in our business with over $1.4 billion in capital expenditures to create new technologies and support franchise programs.\nWe also continue to add to our portfolio of franchise programs. With competitive wins on programs like the integrated Battle Command System or IBCS as well as hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor and next-generation interceptor.\nAs we look forward to '22 and beyond, we expect our organic growth will continue as we win new business and convert the robust backlog we've built over the past several years into sales growth. And while we'll know more about the President's budget request in the coming weeks, we continue to believe that our portfolio is strongly aligned with the threat environment and the key investment priorities of our customers.\nFurther, we expect strong margin performance as well as double-digit free cash flow growth from 2022 through 2024. 2022 guidance reflects our confidence in our strategy, our broad portfolio and our ability to deliver continued growth and strong performance.\nAs reported, the COVID pandemic continued to present challenges to labor availability, parts supply and shipping delays across the economy, particularly in the second half of last year. We have felt these effects and the challenges at both our supply chain and our own labor availability. We will continue to take proactive steps to address such covered risks, both to our employees and our business. And looking forward, our current guidance reflect the factors we know today and our best estimate for the remainder of the year.\nDave is going to provide more details on the quarter, the full year and our guidance in just a few minutes. But turning now to the budget environment. The federal government continues to operate under a continuing resolution that currently run through February 18. Negotiations on the fiscal year 2022 appropriation bills are continuing. And we remain optimistic that Congress will reach an agreement by the end of the first quarter.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act contained a $25 billion increase to the defense budget that represents 5% growth compared to fiscal year 2021, which we expect to also be supported in the appropriation bill. In the NDAA, there is continued support for our mutual programs, and several of our programs received incremental funding above the President's budget request, including Triton, E-2D F-35, F-18 and GATR, among others.\nAnd finally, we expect the FY '23 president budget to be delivered to Congress in March of this year, reflecting this administration's priorities in areas such as Mission Systems, space, missile defense, advanced weapons and deterrent.\nFocusing now on highlights in the quarter, one of our proudest moments with the launch of the web-based telescope on December 25. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor for NASA on Web, and we're honored to have partnered with NASA to provide the world with this revolutionary technology. Web will appear more than 13.5 billion years into the past when the first stars and galaxy's were formed, ushering in an exciting new era of space observation and expanding our understanding of the universe. In addition to Web, we're also supporting NASA's Artemis mission by producing the largest solid rocket motors ever built for the space launch vehicle system, which is being developed to send the first woman and next man to the moon. In the fourth quarter, the space sector received a $3.2 billion award to support Artemis missions 4 through 8.\nAnother important milestone in the quarter was the competitively awarded IBCS in our Defense Systems sector. This program is a centerpiece of the U.S. Army's modernization strategy for air and missile defense and all-domain command and control. It's a prime example of our capabilities to integrate assets in the battle space regardless of source, service or domain. This is one of many examples of how we are helping our customers share data between systems and improve command and control in support of their JADC2 vision.\nIn the area of missile defense, we had several milestones in the quarter, which position us to help our customers track and defend against hypersonic and ballistic missile threats. In the fourth quarter, we announced that HBTSS had passed its critical design review. These satellites are planned to be part of a multilayered network of spacecraft that will detect and track hypersonic missiles.\nAlso in the quarter, we were selected by the Missile Defense Agency to design a glide phase interceptor for regional hypersonic missile defense. In our Mission Systems sector, we continue to see our customers prioritizing development of capabilities that will increase the effectiveness and survivability of legacy systems, as well as new technologies for next-generation systems.\nIn the fourth quarter, MS received an accelerated award for F-16 sabers for approximately $200 million, and full year awards of approximately $700 million. We have now received total contract awards for near 1,000 radars for this program in support of the U.S. Air Force and National Guard as well as several international customers.\nIn addition, our Network Information Systems business area within Mission Systems received approximately $1 billion in award for advanced processing solutions. This portfolio delivers strategic microelectronics focused on high-performance computing and security, which helps our customers with connectivity and processing solutions. We anticipate additional awards in this segment of the portfolio for the next few years, and we expect it will be a significant growth driver for MS in 2022.\nFinally, in aeronautics. The military aircraft market is undergoing a transition as our customers focus their investment in next-generation programs while divesting some legacy platforms. As we discussed certain programs in our portfolio at Aeronautics systems are maturing and experiencing headwinds. But there are also a number of exciting new opportunities that are emerging. This includes next-generation manned aircraft as well as new unmanned opportunities, which U.S. Air Force Secretary Kendall recently announced. In addition to pursuing these longer-term opportunities, we remain focused on executing our programs and delivering for our customers.\nAnother important aspect of our company's future is our strategy for sustainability. We strongly believe that our environmental, social and governance programs play an important role in sustainable, profitable growth and in long-term value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. Northrop Grumman is a leader in conservation activity with a 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.\nIn the fourth quarter, S&P released its global corporate sustainability assessment scores, and we ranked in the 96 percentile. We were included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the sixth consecutive year, and we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.\nOur ESG strategy also includes portfolio management actions. As we've discussed on earnings calls last year, we committed to transition out of the small aging and surveillance contract that we have for cluster munitions, and that contract is complete. And while we continue to be an ammunition supplier as both a prime and a merchant supplier, we have made the decision to transition our prime role in depleted uranium inhibition to another provider, following 1 final single production year contract.\nWe are currently working to establish our next set of sustainability goals and priorities, specifically as they relate to greenhouse gas emissions, water conservation and solid waste diversion with a stronger emphasis on renewable energy. Overall, we're making substantial progress in our ESG journey, and we look forward to sharing more in our upcoming sustainability and TCFD report.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our sector results and guidance. And then I have a few additional comments before we move on to Q&A.\n\nDavid F. Keffer\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was another strong year of performance for the company. Before going through the details of our results and guidance, I'd like to note a few items to keep in mind when comparing Q4 to the same period last year. As we previewed in prior quarters, the divested IT services business, the equipment sale at AS and 4 more working days in Q4 2020 represented over $1.6 billion of sales when compared to Q4 2021. With that said, sales per working day in 2021 were at their highest level in Q4.\nMoving to sector results. We continue to see certain COVID-related effects on our labor and supply chain in Q4, and these effects were most significant in our aeronautics sector. The Q4 decline in AS sales was partially driven by fewer working days and the 2020 equipment sale, and it also included a $93 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on F-35.\nTurning to Defense Systems. Sales declined in Q4 and 2021, primarily due to the IT services divestiture. Organic sales were down 9% in Q4 and 4% for the full year, driven by the completion of our contract at the Lake City ammunition plant, which generated almost $400 million of sales in 2020. Mission Systems organic sales were down 3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduction in working days and up 6% for the full year. Higher 2021 sales were driven by increased volume on GATR, GBSD, (inaudible) J.Crew and restricted programs, among others.\nAnd lastly, Space Systems Q4 and full year organic sales rose by 6% and 24%, respectively. We continued to ramp significantly on franchise programs, including a $1.1 billion increase on GBSD in 2021. Growth was also driven by restricted space programs as well as NGI and Artemis.\nMoving to segment operating income and margin rate. AS operating margin rate decreased to 8.4% in the quarter and 9.7% for the full year due to the unfavorable EAC adjustment on F-35. In our other 3 sectors, segment operating margin rates met or exceeded the high end of our prior 2021 guidance ranges.\nDefense Systems operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to 12.1% in the quarter and 80 basis points to 12% for the full year. Higher operating margin rate was largely due to improved performance as well as recent contract completions.\nAt Mission Systems, operating income and rate grew in both periods. As a result of higher EAC adjustments and business mix changes, operating margin rate grew to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 15.6% for the full year. And at Space Systems, operating margin rate was 9.6% in the quarter and 10.6% for the full year. Favorable EAC adjustments from strong performance on commercial space programs helped offset mix pressures for the year. And keep in mind that space, along with AS and MS, benefited from the pension-related overhead benefits that we recognized in the first quarter of 2021.\nAt the total company level, segment operating margin rate in the fourth quarter was the same as Q4 2020. The even with the F-35 charge in 2021, and it increased 40 basis points for the full year to 11.8%.\nTurning to EPS. Our transaction adjusted EPS declined to 9% from Q4 2020 to Q4 2021, primarily due to lower sales volume from the factors I described earlier. For the full year EPS we exceeded the high end of the EPS guidance range we provided in October.\nTransaction adjusted EPS grew 8% in 2021 due to strong segment performance and lower corporate unallocated costs. Lower corporate unallocated was driven by 2 items we've discussed in prior quarters: the $60 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the former Orbital ATK business; and lower state taxes.\nRegarding our pension plans, asset performance was strong again in 2021 at nearly 11%, the third year in a row of double-digit asset returns. Our FAS discount rate increased 30 basis points to 2.98%. These factors resulted in a mark-to-market benefit of roughly $2.4 billion in 2021. In addition, our net pension funding status has improved by over $3 billion. And on a PBO basis, is now over 93% funded. We continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Also summarized to our pension cost estimates for the years 2022 through 2024. CAS recoveries are projected to continue declining over the planning period. And while this causes an EPS headwind, particularly in 2022, it makes our rates more competitive and our products more affordable. Our CAS prepayment credit is approximately $1.7 billion as of January 1 of this year.\nNow turning to cash. We generated nearly $3.6 billion of operating cash flow and $3.1 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow in 2021, in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we made our final federal and state tax payments associated with the IT services divestiture of almost $200 million. We also made our first payment of roughly $200 million of deferred payroll taxes from the Cares Act legislation. The remaining payment of the same amount will occur this December.\nLooking ahead to 2022, our sector guidance is shown on Slide 9. This outlook assumes that appropriation bills are passed by the end of Q1, and it assumes a relatively consistent level of impact from the effects of COVID that we experienced in 2021.\nAt Aeronautics, we expect sales in the mid- to high $10 billion range. As we noted last quarter, we're projecting headwinds in our HALE portfolio as well as lower sales on JSTARS, F-18 and our restricted business. Sales on F-35 are expected to be slightly higher in 2021 due to the EAC adjustment we booked in Q4. We expect an AS margin rate of approximately 10%, which is up 30 basis points year-over-year. For Defense Systems, we expect sales to be in the high $5 billion range as this business returns to modest organic growth following the IT services divestiture and in the completion of our Lake City contract. Operating margin rate is expected to remain very strong in the high 11% range.\nMission Systems sales are projected to be in the mid-$10 billion range, up from $10.1 billion of organic sales in 2021, reflecting continued strength in demand for our products. Operating margin rate is expected in the low 15% range. Space Systems is expected to remain our fastest-growing business and to become our largest segment in 2022. Sales are projected in the mid-$11 billion range, up from -- up about $1 billion from 2021 with a margin rate in the low 10% range.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our total revenue guidance is $36.2 billion to $36.6 billion, representing a range of 2% to 3% organic growth, consistent with the rate we estimated in October 2021. This growth is enabled by our strong backlog, which stands at over $76 billion, and covers more than 2 years of annual sales. The 2021 book-to-bill of 0.9x was lower than our prior expectation due to the AS F-35 award shift to 2022. More importantly, our 3-year trailing average book-to-bill is approximately 1.22, and remains the foundation of our current and future growth.\nAs COVID-related headwinds that we experienced late in 2021 continue into early 2022, we anticipate that first quarter 2022 sales will be less than 25% of the full year. We have increased the segment operating margin rate outlook that we provided in October, as we now expect a rate roughly consistent with 2021 in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%.\nThis projection reflects our continued disciplined approach to cost management in our efforts to offset mix headwinds with strong program performance. Altogether, we expect transaction adjusted earnings per share to be between $24.50 and $25.10, based on approximately 155 million weighted shares outstanding. As shown on Slide 11, this includes roughly $2 of year-to-year EPS headwinds from lower net pension benefits driven by the reduction in CAS recoveries and higher corporate unallocated expense due to the onetime benefits in 2021. Earnings volume from sales growth strong operating margin performance and the lower share count will help to offset those nonoperational items.\nWe project 2022 transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, assuming the R&D tax amortization law is deferred or repealed. We continue to project about $1 billion of higher cash taxes should current tax law remain in effect. As I mentioned, our cash tax outlook includes the final payroll tax payment from the CARES Act of approximately $200 million. CapEx is expected to remain roughly consistent with 2021 on an absolute dollar basis and slightly lower as a percentage of sales.\nSlide 12 provides our longer-term outlook on cash. The midpoint of our 2022 transaction-adjusted free cash flow guidance is $2.65 billion, and includes roughly $375 million of lower CAS recoveries than 2021. From there, we expect a double-digit free cash flow CAGR through 2024, driven by operational performance, lower CapEx and the absence of the payroll tax headwind. Our base case again assumes deferral of the R&D tax for all periods.\nSpeaking of taxes, we're projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 17% going forward, roughly consistent with 2021, excluding the divestiture or mark-to-market pension effects. Also, we anticipate the resolution of an appeals process for certain open years of legacy OATK tax filings in 2022. Audit and appeals processes are underway, but in earlier stages for certain Northrop tax years. We refer you to our 10-K for additional details on the key items, both timing related and permanent in nature to be resolved in those processes.\nIn closing, we're proud of our 2021 performance and we're focused on continuing to execute well on our business and financial strategy in 2022. With that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Kathy.\n\nKathy J. Warden\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave. In summary, we have strong franchise programs that are well aligned to budget priorities. We are focused on capturing and investing in new growth opportunities while also executing to drive earnings and cash flow growth. We delivered a solid set of results in 2021, and we are well positioned to continue growing and performing in 2022 and beyond.\nOur top priority for cash deployment remains shareholder return, including a competitive dividend and share repurchases. With that in mind, our Board of Directors recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. And based on our outlook today, we plan on returning at least $1.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchase in 2022.\nBefore turning to your questions, I would like to thank the Northrop Grumman team for delivering solid operational results with dedication and for severance. We have extraordinary talent, and this includes our leadership team.\nAs we announced in November, Blake Larson, is retiring after a 40-year career with Northrop Grumman and its heritage companies. Blake has helped to position our space business for incredible growth and as important, a focus on performance and quality. We are grateful for his contributions to our company and our country.\nAnd I'd also like to welcome Tom Wilson to my leadership team as he succeeds Blake. Tom brings strong experience in the space market. He was part of the Space team, and I'm confident in his ability to lead this business.\nSo with that, we'll go ahead and open the call up for questions. Natalia, back to you."

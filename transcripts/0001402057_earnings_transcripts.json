I want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level overview of our third quarter financial and strategic performance and share some thoughts on the balance of the year. I will take you through a more detailed look at our results, capital strategy and priorities and full year outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for Q&A.\nThird quarter results underscore the power of our full stack full life cycle solutions. The team executed well in an extremely dynamic and complex environment. For the quarter, consolidated net sales were $5.7 billion, up 4% above last year. Gross profit was $1.3 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP operating income was $531 million, down 1%; non-GAAP net income per share was $2.71, up 3%; and we delivered adjusted free cash flow of $209 million. These results reflect the power of strong execution when coupled with our extensive portfolio of products, services, solutions and diverse customer end markets. They also reflect the power of our deep end market knowledge and strong durable customer relationships.\nYou see the benefit of this in our government education results, armed with insights into evolving protocols, funding mechanisms and budget priorities, our team drew on their combined deep industry expertise and trusted customer relationships to guide clients through an unprecedented period of change.\nDuring the quarter, customer priorities remained focused on must to-dos, such as security enhancements and client device upgrades that are foundational to enabling modern work. And once again, major capital investments were heavily scrutinized. Corporate and small business customers also prioritized preproduction AI trials to prove out use cases to validate concepts and ROIs. These priorities led to strength in cloud, software and services.\nLet's take a deeper look at how customer priorities and unique market dynamics shaped performance across our end markets and portfolio in the quarter. As always, there are 3 main drivers of our results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our products, services and solutions and relentless execution of our 3-part strategy.\nFirst, our balanced portfolio of diverse customer end markets. We have 5 U.S. sales channels: Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government and Education. Each channel is a $1 billion-plus business annually. Additionally, our U.K. and Canadian operations together delivered sales of $2.5 billion last year.\nOur scale allows us to segment our businesses into customer end markets with dedicated sales professionals, industry experts and technical resources who deeply understand the unique priorities of each market. When end markets behave differently from each other, the diversity of our customer base serves us well. The benefit of our scale and end market diversity was evident once again in the third quarter.\nSmall Business delivered double-digit growth in top line and gross profit as customers continue to lean more into technology in this dynamic environment. Growth was powered by success delivering cloud and client device solutions. While still nascent, we saw an uptick in AI workstations, which are particularly well suited for small businesses.\nFunctioning as mini AI servers capable of running AI models locally at the network edge, AI workstations enable rapid prototyping and deployment of advanced models, helping small businesses innovate faster.\nCorporate delivered mid-single-digit top line growth with low single-digit gross profit. The team's ability to address customer focus on mission-critical priorities drove excellent performance in security and cloud gross profit and top line.\nClient Devices also remained a priority increasing mid-single digits in top line and double digits in gross profit. The team's success addressing these priorities offset lower demand for infrastructure solutions. The public team executed well within unsettled end markets, delivering 1% top line growth with low single-digit gross profit.\nGovernment net sales increased 8%. State and local delivered an impressive quarter with double-digit net sales and gross profit growth, which more than offset the anticipated decline in federal. Both teams navigated the post DOGE landscape with agility and precision, with the federal team showcasing our strategic value to their agency customers, laying a solid foundation for future growth.\nGrowth in higher ed was offset by an expected decline in K-12 and total education net sales declined 9%. Gross margin benefited from a shift in K-12 mix away from Chromebooks coupled with strong cloud and software growth and the teams delivered combined gross profit growth despite the decline in net sales.\nSimilar to education, health care gross profit grew faster than its 7% top line growth. Growth was driven by cloud solutions that deliver clinical continuity and security, which remain top priorities. The dynamic in the quarter was consistent with the strong performance in the prior 4 quarters.\nWe are watching for signs of customer hesitancy caused by changes in funding, particularly among health care clients relying on Medicare payments, which can constitute up to 30% of their cash flow. Standout performance was delivered once again by our U.K. and Canadian operations together reported as other, which increased net sales by 9%, and -- both teams executed extremely well under unsettled conditions.\nU.K. net sales increased by double digits and Canada by mid-single digits. Profitability in both markets grew faster than net sales. Clearly, this quarter's results demonstrate the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of our performance, the breadth of our full stack full life cycle offerings.\nThe team's ability to address customers' top priorities drove balanced performance across the portfolio. Hardware top line increased 3%. Following last quarter's strong solutions Hardware performance, the lumpiness in enterprise projects we have seen in recent years continued, and growth was more muted with strength in NetComm and Servers, partially offset by a decline in storage.\nConsolidated Client Device growth continued at a healthy 7% pace with growth across most end markets, partially offset by declines in K-12 and Federal. Software increased 4% with excellent gross profit performance driven by cloud and security. Beyond security, top customer software priorities included network resiliency, next-generation customer service and support and application suites tied to operating system and device refresh.\nServices was the standout performer up 9% top line and contributing 9% of total CDW top line this quarter, up from 5% in 2020. Strong performance was powered by double-digit top line and profit increases in CDW professional and managed services. This quarter, Services delivered nearly 1/3 of our total gross profit growth and bolstered gross margin.\nAnd that brings us to the final performance driver this quarter, the impact of our strategic investments, investments designed to create better outcomes for our business and for our customers, investments that are focused on enhancing our customer-facing capabilities and our internal capabilities, which together drive profitable growth by improving how we operate and how we serve.\nDuring the quarter, we made progress on our company-wide evolution to embed AI into the core of how we operate, serve and grow, a strategy designed to drive productivity and efficiency and empower our coworkers. From conversational AI and cdw.com that enhances product discovery and improved sales conversion to intelligent agents that streamline presales qualification and self-directed agents created by our coworkers, we are embedding AI across the enterprise.\nEfforts, while earlier in the adoption cycle, are already translating into better coworker and customer experiences as we scale AI across our business, we are unlocking new levels of agility, efficiency and service quality.\nOur AI offerings enable our customers to unlock value as well. As with prior waves of innovation, customers are focused on translating AI's potential into measurable business impact. This is particularly true for customers looking to harness AI to leapfrog traditional barriers and gain a competitive edge. And just like our prior innovation cycles, while eager to accelerate adoption and capture value, many customers don't have time or resources for trial and error and need a trusted partner to guide them. That's where CDW comes in.\nWith our deep expertise and comprehensive portfolio, we are delivering enterprise-grade AI solutions that are practical, secure and scalable. Whether it's intelligent search, workflow automation or embedded AI powered diagnostics, our solutions unlock real business value without the complexity or cost of building from scratch, while avoiding pitfalls and ensuring long-term success.\nA standard example of this is a recent engagement with a national service company, an engagement where CDW designed a comprehensive AI data hardware and software solution. By integrating CDW Advisory Services, development cloud architecture and hardware prototyping, our solution delivers cloud-native architecture, embedded systems and centralized observability tools, all tailored to the customer's unique operational needs.\nThe solution includes AI-powered diagnostics and real-time performance dashboards, which together create a smarter, more scalable infrastructure. The outcome: data-driven decisions that are enabling smarter operations with greater efficiency, like predictive maintenance and supply chain management and data that unlocks new revenue streams aligned to their business goals.\nThis project exemplifies our value proposition for customers, deliver enterprise-grade technology and AI capabilities in a way that's accessible, customizable and outcomes driven. This is the heart of our value proposition, driving tangible business outcomes that meet customers where they are. Our value proposition shines in AI where we help customers move beyond the hype to unlock tangible value.\nThat leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Given our year-to-date performance and current market conditions, we are maintaining our prudent full year outlook, which calls for U.S. IT market growth to be in the low single digits on a customer spend basis with CDW growth premium of 200 to 300 basis points.\nClearly, we are operating under a lot of unknowns, including the duration of the government shutdown which could not only impact federal results, but could have an impact on other end markets, including health care and education. At the same time, the wildcards we spoke about last quarter, including recessionary conditions, higher inflation, increased geopolitical unrest and outside changes to announce tariffs persist.\nI know many of you may be wondering what we expect for 2026. As is our custom, we are in the middle of our planning process, and we'll provide our thoughts on our year-end conference call. As we look forward, regardless of market conditions, our focus remains squarely on execution, leveraging our competitive strength to deliver consistent customer value and controlling what we can control.\nIn a time of unprecedented technological change and uncertain market conditions, our value proposition has never been stronger. Customers are turning to CDW as a trusted partner to help them navigate complexity, unlock opportunity and drive meaningful outcomes. We're confident in our strategy, grounded in our capabilities and committed to delivering results.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more details on our financial performance. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our remaining outlook for 2025.\nThird quarter gross profit of $1.3 billion was up 4.6% year-over-year. This was above our expectation of low single-digit year-over-year growth, as our teams captured increased demand for Software and Services alongside continued growth in Client Devices and NetComm in this complex and dynamic environment.\nSimilar to the second quarter, we did not see any meaningful levels of pull forward related to tariffs or other factors. Gross margin of 21.9% was up 10 basis points over the prior year's third quarter, back in line with our overall expectations of roughly flat to 2024 levels.\nGross margin was also up meaningfully 110 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by the impact of a higher mix of netted down revenues, continued strong growth in services and a slight mix out of Client and Devices sequentially despite the category's continued solid growth.\nEvery channel grew year-over-year except education, as our customers balance priorities across our diverse portfolio. Demand for CDW professional and managed services continued to be strong at 14%. This can be seen in net sales transferred over time or CDW's principal. Overall, cloud infrastructure, SaaS and security offerings were strengths in the quarter. These are offerings included in the category of net sales transferred at a point in time or CDW's agent or netted down sales.\nNetted down revenues continue to represent an important and durable trend within our business, representing 36% of gross profit up from 35.7% in Q3 2024 and up meaningfully from 32.9% in the prior quarter. Customers across end markets outside of Education and Federal continue to invest in client devices, driven by Win 10 end of life and the enablement of modern work practices.\nOn the solutions front, Software and NetComm growth continued, although storage was softer in the quarter as demand for hardware upgrades in the data center space remains uneven. I would also like to highlight how our small business and international teams are executing exceptionally well in a challenging macroeconomic environment.\nAlongside this, our public teams continue to manage shift in government priorities and funding, which I'll touch on a bit more in the outlook section. Our teams navigated this dynamic environment with CDW and our customers delivering results that exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the power of our diverse end markets. Thank you to our team for your efforts.\nTurning to expenses for the third quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $725 million, up 8.7% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations that asymmetrical timing of expenses compared to 2024 would inflate the year-over-year expense growth comparisons in Q3 and Q4 of 2025.\nThis increase in expense was primarily driven by commissions related to higher gross profit achievement and the impact of higher performance-based expenses relative to the prior year. Notwithstanding the efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit for the quarter was 57.7%, representing progress back towards our sweet spot in the 55% to 56% range.\nWe continually work to structurally align our business for stronger future expense leverage. Coworker count at the end of the quarter was approximately 14,900, down both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter with customer-facing coworker count of 10,700, down slightly year-over-year. Our goal is to balance growth, expansion of capabilities and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations.\nNon-GAAP operating income was approximately $531 million, down 0.6% versus the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.2% was up 50 basis points from the second quarter, but down 50 basis points from the prior year third quarter of 9.7%. Net interest expense was relatively flat year-over-year.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate was marginally below the low end of our range at 25.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $357 million in the quarter, up 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. With third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 131.8 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.71, up 3% versus the prior year third quarter and above our expectations of flat to modestly up year-over-year.\nMoving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was $5.2 billion, roughly flat with the prior quarter. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.8 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 11 days, below the low end of our target range of high-teens to low 20s. This cash conversion outcome reflects our effective management of working capital, including disciplined management of our inventory levels, even as Hardware sales remain firm and Client Device growth continues.\nAs we've mentioned in the past, timing and marketing dynamics will influence working capital and the cash conversion cycle in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $209 million in the quarter, bringing us to $668 million year-to-date. This reflects 68% of non-GAAP net income moderately below our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income, but relatively in line with our expectations given the role timing plays throughout the year.\nWe expect a seasonally strong fourth quarter free cash flow to move the full year 2025 free cash flow back closer to the rule of thumb. We utilized cash consistent with our 2025 capital allocation objectives during the quarter, including returning approximately $150 million in share repurchases and $82 million in the form of dividends.\nAs a reminder, we began the year targeting to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in 2025. Right now, we are clearly ahead of the pace through the third quarter having returned $747 million to shareholders or 112% of adjusted free cash flow.\nThat brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with our non-GAAP net income. We're announcing an approximately 1% increase in our dividend to $2.52 annually, our 12th consecutive year of an increase. We will continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward.\nOur second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the quarter at 2.5x net leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 3x. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity, while maintaining flexibility.\nFinally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchase remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth. Given our actions to date in 2025, we now expect to meaningfully surpass our return of capital of 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2025.\nWhile we remain active in the M&A market, our consistent year-to-date cash flow has allowed us to be opportunistic towards share repurchases as we deem our stock to be attractive at these valuations.\nNow turning to our outlook. Throughout 2025, we navigated a complex environment with appropriate level of prudence, a view that we've maintained despite our strong results. We've been laser-focused on controlling what we can control and supporting our customers only as we only know how to do in this dynamic market.\nGiven the recent government shutdown, we believe our continued prudence is warranted. Our remaining 2025 outlook assumes continued frictional impacts in the Government Education segments, potential funding shortfalls for health care customers and a level of general economic uncertainty and caution. It does not, however, factor in recessionary conditions, higher inflation, increased political unrest and outsized changes announced tariffs. As always, as the landscape changes next year, we will provide you with updates each quarter.\nWith these factors in mind, we are holding our full year 2025 view of low single-digit growth for the IT market. We continue to target market outperformance of 200 to 300 basis points on a customer spend basis. Our expectations for low- to mid-single-digit gross profit growth for the full year is unchanged. We continue to expect second half gross profit contribution to be slightly above the first half, but lower than the historical split of 48% and 52%, and we continue to expect 2025 gross margins to be roughly consistent to 2024 levels and remain well above rates from 3-plus years ago.\nFinally, we continue to expect our full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year, as we focus on profitable growth, exceptional customer outcomes and effective execution of our capital allocation priorities. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a constant currency basis. On that note, our expectation for currency is to be a slight tailwind to reported growth rates for the year.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. We anticipate gross profit to grow at a low- to mid-single-digit rate year-over-year and to be down low- to mid-single digits sequentially, relatively aligned to historical seasonality.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect fourth quarter operating expenses to be modestly down quarter-over-quarter, aligned with gross profit, but reflecting some investments back into the business. This will result in non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of gross profit to be higher than both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2025.\nAs a reminder, operating expense levels in 2024, particularly in the second half of the year, benefited from lower performance-based attainment and thus reversal of incentive compensation accruals. This muted the run rate expense load in the second half of last year.\nFinally, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be down slightly year-over-year and down sequentially, impacted by the aforementioned factors.\nThis concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future results calls.\nWith that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. Today to review our second quarter 2025 results are Chris Leahy, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Al Miralles, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release was distributed this morning and is available on our website, investor.cdw.com, along with supplemental slides that you can use to follow along during the call. I'd like to remind you that certain comments made in this presentation are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level overview of our second quarter financial and strategic performance and share some thoughts on the balance of the year. Al will take you through a more detailed look at our results, capital strategy and priorities and outlook for 2025. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.\nSecond quarter results underscore the power of our full stack full life cycle solutions. In a dynamic and complex environment, the team delivered double-digit top line growth even as federal and education markets faced evolving headwinds. As a result, that reflects not only strong execution but also the strategic advantage of our diversified portfolio of products, services, solutions and customer end markets.\nFor the quarter, consolidated net sales were $6 billion, up 10% over last year. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP operating income was $520 million, up 2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.60, up 4% and we delivered adjusted free cash flow of $210 million. The team was focused and determined, staying true to our value proposition and customer-centric approach.\nCustomer focus was similar to the first quarter and remained squarely on must does versus wants with 2 key priorities: first, client devices, which reflected a baseline replacement cycle amplified by the Windows 10 end-of-life transition and a heightened focus on productivity initiatives. Second, mission-critical infrastructure projects, which were particularly strong across enterprise customers in our corporate channel.\nThe team's success addressing customer priorities delivered gross profit growth of 5%, which exceeded our expectations. Let's take a closer look at how customer priorities and market dynamics shaped performance across our end markets and portfolio in the quarter. As always, there were 3 main drivers of our results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our products, services and solutions and relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy.\nFirst, our balanced portfolio of diverse customer end markets. We have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, health care, government and education. Each channel is a $1 billion-plus business annually. Additionally, our U.K. and Canadian operations together delivered sales of USD 2.5 billion last year.\nOur scale allows us to segment our business into [ customer-end ] markets with dedicated sales professionals, industry experts and technical resources who deeply understand the unique priorities of each market. When end markets behave differently from each other, the diversity of our customer base serves us well.\nThe benefits of our scale and diverse end markets was evident once again in the second quarter with strong performance in commercial, health care in the U.K. and Canada, offsetting expected federal and education declines.\nCommercial performance, which includes corporate and Small Business was strong and balanced. Both teams did an exceptional job pivoting to customers shifting needs and areas of focus, with Corporate net sales up 18% and Small Business up 13%. Greater enterprise market penetration in Corporate drove excellent hybrid infrastructure growth, and both teams also delivered strong client device growth as they leveraged our comprehensive suite of client solutions and services to help customers meet their priorities to both enhance workplace experience and productivity. Small Business also continued its success helping customers use SaaS to drive efficiency and flexibility and delivered strong double-digit cloud performance.\nPublic increased 2% as the team helps customers navigate a dynamic environment marked by changes in funding streams and protocols. Once again, Healthcare was a standout performer with net sales up 24% as they continue to help our customers address clinical continuity. Education posted an 11% decline in top line. K-12 declined by double digits, driven by both changes to federal funding rules and expected changes in funding streams, which included the expiration of stimulus funds.\nResults also reflect the expected impact of Chromebook buying during the first quarter ahead of anticipated price increases, which we previously identified. Higher ed posted a modest decline as institutions assess the impact of new regulatory and funding pressures, including ramp freezes and student visa uncertainty. Despite these challenges continue to move ahead, most notably, network upgrades vital to student satisfaction.\nGovernment increased 3%, mid-single-digit state and local growth more than offset an expected decline in federal. Many state and local jurisdictions move ahead on critical projects as they closed out their fiscal years and the 2025 budget cycle. Services continues to be a focus area for state and local, up by significant double digit.\nFederal performance reflected the impact of new administration priorities with mixed performance across the various agencies. Some civilian agencies caused purchases and others move forward. With the evolving funding mechanisms and shifting rules of engagement, the team work with customers to help them prioritize spend and best address mission-critical needs, capturing opportunities where budget exists.\nStandout performance was delivered by our U.K. and Canadian operations, which we reported as others. The U.K. team capitalized on client device demand and captured full stack opportunities with public sector customers, while our Canada team drove meaningful growth despite tariff-related macroeconomic uncertainty. This exceptional execution by both teams delivered a combined top line increase of 12% on a reported basis, each up high single digits or better in local currencies. Clearly, second quarter results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets.\nResults this quarter also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our full stack full life cycle offering. The team's ability to address customers' top priorities drove strong performance across software, hardware and services.\nHardware increased 9%, driven by significant increases in infrastructure solutions, notably NetComm storage and servers as well as client devices. NetComm servers both increased top line by meaningful double digits, while storage increased by high single digits. Client devices increased 12%. ASPs held strong and unit growth was solid.\nSoftware increased by 16% with excellent growth across all end markets except K-12. Growth was driven by [ Tolophony], application suites, network management and backup disaster recovery. Cloud spend increased by double digits with growth driven by security, productivity, data storage and recovery and collaboration. Services had another excellent quarter, up 8% in total with CDW professional managed top line up 13%.\nAnd that brings us to the final performance driver for this quarter. The impact of our customer-driven strategic investments, which for the past 6 years have been focused on expanding the breadth of our services capabilities. Capabilities that are integral to delivering full stack end-to-end outcomes and our key point of differentiation in the market.\nToday, our comprehensive services portfolio spans the full life cycle from advisory to implementation to orchestration and managed services that include cybersecurity readiness, infrastructure planning and execution, strategic IT road map data manager, DevOps and 24/7 365 managed services for infrastructure security, cloud and digital experience.\nCapability is critical to our ability to help our customers thrive in the ever-evolving landscape. A great example of this in action is our AI Center of Excellence, a comprehensive approach that helps transform AI from concept to execution. Powered by a multidisciplinary team of data engineers, architects and analysts, our experts deliver structured workshops to identify use cases, establish governance and security frameworks and define ROI.\nFrom there, our proof-of-concept services provide a scalable path to validate and deploy AI solutions. Rapid prototyping follows where we accelerate adoption and impact using our deep vertical expertise and infrastructure-ready solutions across cloud, edge and hybrid infrastructures.\nFinally, our AI managed services operationalized AI at scale, tackling the unique challenges of AI workloads with consulting guidance and purpose-built tooling. As you can see, CDW AI solutions provide comprehensive support across the entire AI life cycle, solutions that deliver fast, secure and ROI-driven innovation. Innovation that leads to measurable outcomes for our customer and further deepens our relationship.\nLet me highlight 2 examples that demonstrate how our services investments are driving meaningful customer outcomes. First, the rapidly scale an apparel company needed to improve the efficiency of their IT support operations. By integrating our cloud foundation managed services for AWS with our generative AI expertise, we delivered a [indiscernible] leverage of historical ticket data to streamline workflows. As new ticket arrive the AI agent references past cases and recommends resolutions in real time. The 6-figure engagement included knowledge transfer documentation, infrastructure setup, agents development, testing and integration and most importantly, transform the customer support operations free engineers to focus on strategic initiatives.\nThe second example is a comprehensive security solution we are delivering to a leading North American transport company. Their legacy security operations center was one size fits all and did not meet their evolving operational needs.\nWhat began as a strategic advisory engagement evolved into a full-scale identity and access management initiative ultimately leading to a multiyear managed services engagement with $10 million total contract value. An engagement that includes 24/7 managed security operation across their entire technology stack, including multi-vendor firewalls, security information and event management systems endpoint detection and response, vulnerability scanning, third-party risk management and identity and access management across platforms. It also includes continuous enhancement through penetration testing, purple team assessments and embedded automation.\nTwo great examples that underscore our differentiated approach as a trusted partner invested in our customers' long-term success. They also demonstrate how our strategic investments deepen customer relationships and how they drive sustained growth, industry-leading margins and strong cash flow.\nAnd that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. We are maintaining our 2025 outlook, which calls for U.S. IT market growth to be in the low single digits on a customer spend basis with a CDW gross premium of 200 to 300 basis points, a view supported by what we are seeing and hearing in the market, underpinned by a continued level of prudence.\nMarket dislocation in government and education is expected to continue for the balance of the year. Armed with insights into evolving protocols funding mechanisms and budget allocations, our teams are drawing on their deep industry expertise and trusted customer relationships to both formulate strategies to navigate this period of change and to emerge even stronger, outcomes only possible by our scale and unique ability to verticalize.\nThe wildcards we spoke about last quarter, including recessionary conditions, higher inflation, increased geopolitical unrest and outsized changes to announced tariffs still exist. We will keep a watchful eye on market conditions and our practice -- as is our practice, update our view as we move through the year.\nAs we look ahead, our priorities remain clear. We will focus on what we can control and execute with precision. We will maximize the strength of our business model and leverage our competitive advantages, including our full staff full life cycle solutions to help customers navigate complexity and achieve their goals. Our commitment to delivering customer value is unwavering. Our strategy is working, and our teams are energized and executing with discipline and purpose. Now let me turn it over to Al.\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our second quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2025 outlook.\nSecond quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was up 5% year-over-year. This was above our expectations of low single-digit growth as our teams captured increased demand for software and infrastructure solutions hardware alongside continued growth in client devices and services in this complex and dynamic environment. We did not see any meaningful levels of pull forward this quarter related to tariffs or other factors.\nGross margin of 20.8% was below Q2 2024 and driven by the impact of a higher contribution from large customer corporate customers, which tends to carry lower rates as well as a lower mix of netted down revenues. Gross margin is sensitive to changes in both customer and product mix. This quarter, these changes were notable and gross margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year.\nCorporate, Small Business and Healthcare customers focused on hardware upgrades, including client devices, which, together with meaningful spend on network and data center solutions through a prioritization away from sales transferred at a point of time where CDW is agent, also known as netted down revenues. This led to a lower relative mix of netted down sales compared to last year and a lower percentage of contribution to gross profit at 32.9%.\nNetted down revenues continue to represent an important and durable trend within our business. Alongside our professional and managed services listed as transferred over time or CDW's principal which continued their strong growth trajectory, increasing 13% year-over-year and reflecting investments we've made in the business over the last 6 years.\nConsistent with recent trends, commercial customers prioritize mission-critical hardware investments that could not be postponed and public customers dealt with shifts in government priorities and funding. Given the unique dynamics impacting several of our end markets, our sales and gross profit performance demonstrates the power of our diverse end markets and how we are meeting our customers where they need us most. I want to thank our teams for navigating this environment and delivering above our expectations.\nTurning to expenses for the second quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $722 million, up 7.2% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by commissions related to higher gross profit achievement and the impact of higher other performance-based expenses.\nFor the second quarter, the efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit was 58.1%, down 230 basis compared to the first quarter, representing the expected leverage on seasonally greater profit dollars but up 130 basis points year-over-year. We continue to structurally align our business for stronger future expense leverage.\nCoworker count at the end of the quarter was approximately 15,000 with customer-facing coworker count at [ 10,007 ] [indiscernible], both slightly down year-over-year. Our goal is to balance growth, expansion of capabilities and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from broader operations.\nNon-GAAP operating income was approximately $520 million, up 1.8% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.7% was up 20 basis points from the first quarter, but down 70 basis points from the prior year's second quarter level of 9.4%. Net interest expense was $4.5 million higher year-over-year, impacted primarily by lower interest earned on cash balances and higher average interest rates on our long-term debt.\nNon-GAAP net income was $344 million in the quarter, up 1.4% on a year-over-year basis. With second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $132.4 million non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.60, up 3.9% versus the prior year second quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5.2 billion, roughly flat with the prior year. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, below the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital including disciplined management of our inventory levels even as Solutions hardware sales accelerated and client device growth continues.\nAs we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $210 million in the quarter, bringing us to roughly $460 million year-to-date. This reflects 73% of non-GAAP net income slightly below our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income, but in line with our expectations given the role timing plays throughout the year. We utilized cash consistent with our 2025 capital allocation objectives during the quarter, including returning approximately $150 million in share repurchases and $82 million in the form of dividends. As a reminder, we target returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in 2025. So we are clearly ahead of pace through the second quarter at 112%.\nThat brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income growth. We have increased the dividend for 112th consecutive years through 2024. We continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place.\nWe ended the second quarter at 2.4x net leverage with our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity and while managing flexibility as evidenced by our 2024 debt refinancing and redemption actions and the subsequent drawdown of our 2025 senior notes this quarter.\nFinally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchase remain important drivers of shareholder value. We can evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth. Likewise, we remain committed to our targets returning 50% to 75% of adjusted cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2025.\nNow turning to our outlook. We came into 2025 with an appropriately prudent view of the year. And despite the strong first half, we believe this environment calls for continued prudence. Last quarter, we shared that we'll be laser-focused on controlling what we can control and supporting our customers only as we know how to do in this dynamic environment. This has not changed.\nOur outlook assumes continued frictional impact in the Government and Education segments and a level of general economic uncertainty and caution, but it does not factor in recessionary conditions, higher inflation, increased geopolitical unrest and outsized changes to announced tariffs. As always, as the landscape changes, we will provide you with updates each quarter.\nWith these factors in mind, we are holding our full year 2025 view of low single-digit growth for the IT market. We continue to target market outperformance of 200 to 300 basis points on a customer basis. Based on the anticipated mix of products and solutions, we now expect low to mid-single-digit gross profit growth for the full year 2025, contemplating our strong first half along with our prudent view on the remainder of the year.\nWe continue to expect second half gross profit contribution to be slightly above the first half, but lower than the historical split of 48% and 52%, respectively. And we continue to expect 2025 gross margins to be roughly consistent with 2024 levels and remain well above rates from 3-plus years ago.\nFinally, we expect our full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year as we focus on profitable growth, exceptional customer outcomes and effective execution of our capital allocation priorities. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a constant currency basis. On that note, we expect currency to be a slight tailwind through reported growth rates for the year.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We anticipate gross profit to grow at a low single-digit rate year-over-year and to be flat to slightly above the second quarter level.\nMoving down the P&L, we expect third quarter operating expenses to increase slightly quarter-over-quarter, aligned with gross profit and combined with some investments back into the business. This will result in non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of gross profit levels to be higher than in the third quarter of 2024, but consistent with Q2 2025 levels. Keep in mind that operating expense levels in '24, particularly in the second half of 2024, benefited from lower performance-based attainment and thus the reversal of incentive compensation accruals which will compare unfavorably to 2025.\nFinally, we expect third quarter non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be flat to modestly up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, impacted by the aforementioned factors. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]."

I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our first quarter performance and provide thoughts on our view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results further perspective on our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.\nThe team had an excellent start to the year with strong execution during a period of rapidly changing market dynamics. Once again, the benefit of our strategic progress was evident with our industry-leading margins. Strong expense management and effective use of capital drove leverage down the P&L. For the quarter, net sales were $5.2 billion, 8% higher than last year on an average daily sales basis.\nGross profit was $1.1 billion, 7% higher than last year on an average daily basis. Non-GAAP operating income was $444 million, up 10% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.15, up 12%. Broadly speaking, customers remain focused on mission-critical projects and must does, and their priorities were consistent with 2024, laser focus on operating efficiency and expense elasticity with 1 addition.\nClient device prioritization, which reflected 3 factors: need for refresh, the upcoming Windows 10 expiration and the desire to get ahead of tariff-related price increases. Underlying demand was solid. Commercial market growth was consistent with the favorable trajectory we saw late in the fourth quarter. Tariff uncertainty slowed down major infrastructure investments but also drove demand for client devices and greater focus on expense elasticity, consumption-based solutions and services.\nFederal government market growth was subdued throughout the quarter as agencies digested the impact of new policy priorities, while education growth accelerated towards the end of the quarter, driven by Chromebook demand ahead of potential price increases. First quarter results underscore the power of our full stack full life cycle solutions.\nThe team's ability to provide solutions that address customers' priorities for cost optimization drove excellent performance across services, software and cloud. Let's take a closer look at how customer priority and market dynamics impacted end market and portfolio performance in the quarter. As always, there were 3 main drivers of our results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy.\nFirst, our balanced portfolio of diverse customer end markets. We have 5 U.S. channels: Corporate, Small business, health care, government and education. Each channel is a $1 billion-plus business annually. Additionally, our U.K. and Canadian operations together delivered sales of USD 2.5 billion last year. Our scale allows us to segment our business into customer end markets with dedicated sellers and technical resources who deeply understand and address the unique priorities of each market.\nThe benefit of our diverse end markets was evident in the first quarter with all customer end markets posting average daily sales growth. Commercial top line performance, which includes corporate and small business was strong and balanced. Corporate and small business increased by 6% and 8%, respectively. Our ability to address both customer priorities for client devices and customer priorities for cost optimization with as-a-service and ratable solutions drove solid profitability and our commercial gross margin was steady year-over-year.\nPublic top line increased by 11%. Healthcare was a standout performer with net sales up 20%, driven by client devices cloud and services. Education increased top line by 11% with balanced performance across both K-12 and higher education. K-12 growth was driven by Chromebook, reflecting both customer refresh needs and buying ahead of anticipated tariff price increases, while higher ed growth was driven by security, data center and services.\nGovernment net sales increased slightly as the impact of pauses in federal agency decision-making due to new administration priorities was offset by state and local growth. Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations posted a 10% increase led by the U.K. The second driver of performance was our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services, a key point of differentiation for us in the marketplace.\nThis quarter, we had balanced performance across hardware, software and services with each increasing by high single digits or better. Hardware increased top line by 7% excellent growth in client devices, which increased more than 20%, was partially offset by declines in both NetComm and storage. Software top line increased by 10%. Top line growth was primarily driven by the ongoing shift in spend from traditional networking to software-defined networking architectures.\nSoftware gross profit increased faster than net sales. Security performance was strong, consistent with the fourth quarter with both top line and gross profit growing by low double digits. Priorities met by as a service and ratable solutions to optimize spend drove excellent performance in cloud with spend, top line and gross profit all up meaningful double digits. Customers continue to lean into CDW services to build and execute their strategies, manage expenses and accomplish mission-critical objectives, which drove a services top line increase of 14%.\nThe CDW managed and professional services top line and gross profit both increased by double digits. The third driver of performance is our ongoing investment in our customer-driven strategy, a strategy designed to maximize our relevance and differentiation in the marketplace and continuously fortify our leading position as vendor partner of choice and trusted adviser to our customers.\nTo meet the accelerated pace of change over the last 5 years, we have concentrated our strategic investments on key high-growth, high relevance areas like cloud adoption and optimization. Cybersecurity, IT workflow automization and AI expertise. Given the vital role services play in today's interconnected solutions, recent investments have been focused on embedding services throughout our entire portfolio, including Mission Cloud Services, which closed last November.\nAnd just as our previous investments have done on a mission, a leader in AI and a premier AWS partner furthers our ability to deliver mission-critical outcomes for customers. An ability that is more important than ever in today's dynamic environment where customers continue to move forward with mission-critical projects. Movement we are seeing across our portfolio and especially in security, where the need to deliver seamless access for employees while ensuring data protection is crucial, a need that our full suite of security solutions underpinned by products services and deep expertise addresses.\nA great example of this in action is the solution CDW developed for an American design or a manufacturer of heavy-duty commercial trucks. An industry for more than 100 years, the company had multiple HR systems with employees logging in daily across office and around the world. Managing trust and identity required manual intervention and made it difficult to get a global view of the data.\nWorking closely with the company's CISO, our team engineered, designed and implemented a solution that migrated data from on-premises identity governance to cloud-hosted centralized control. Utilizing artificial intelligence to streamline processes, the solution delivered a 0 trust environment for nearly 25,000 users. Not only did the solution deliver significant measurable outcomes through enhanced user access, compliance and operational efficiencies, the scalable automated platform also set the company up for future growth.\nFor CDW, the solution represents a multimillion dollar multiyear software transaction and professional services fees that exceeded $1 million for our team's engineering and implementation work. This is a great example of the power of our strategic investments, helping customers achieve mission-critical outcomes. And that leads me to a topic that's on everyone's mind, our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nWe are maintaining our 2025 outlook, which calls for U.S. IT market growth to be in the low single digits on a customer spend basis with a CDW growth premium of 200 to 300 basis points. While market parameters have changed since we first shared our outlook with you in February, our current view is underpinned by what we are seeing and hearing in the market, our first quarter performance and a continued level of prudence.\nWhile the start of the second quarter, with the start of the second quarter, the overall rhythm of the business has been solid and spend in the commercial market remains healthy. Despite the pull forward of client devices at the end of the first quarter, both written and shipped orders have been consistent with overall first quarter performance. Customers indicate that while they are watchful of the environment, they do not intend to alter their course for now.\nMaintaining our full year outlook balances are better-than-expected first quarter results in core customer sentiment with 2 countervailing factors. First, it recognizes that our federal and education customers will need more time to adjust to recent government efficiency initiatives that will impact their IT planning, prioritization and in some cases, their budgets. Second, it incorporates a level of general economic uncertainty and caution that could meet growth.\nOur outlook does not factor in potential wildcards such as recessionary conditions. Of course, the environment remains fluid, and as always, we'll continue to monitor the market and update our view as necessary throughout the year. There is no doubt that we are operating in uncertain times, but we have experienced uncertainty in the past. During prior periods of uncertainty, most recently of pandemic and post pandemic supply chain crisis and before that, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, our partners and customers turned to us.\nThey recognize the vital role we play in their success and knew that leveraging our strengths would lead to better outcomes for them. Once again, customers and partners are turning to us to help them navigate the challenges of today's dynamic landscape so they can effectively address cloud workload growth, increased security threats an aging client device base and significant data challenging, including how to manage data to leverage AI for insights and productivity aspirations.\nAs they always do, our team has rolled up its sleeves. They are working with their customers to scenario plan, determine how to optimize spend and identify sources of funds. They are also working with customers to test multiple brands for future projects, providing product optionality depending on different tariff scenarios. And to prepare for a potential economic slowdown, the team continues to help customers evaluate the economics of various architectures and procurement models.\nAs our customers navigate this dynamic period, we are ready and confident in the power of our strategy and strength of our business model to weather uncertainty and serve our customers. Regardless of market conditions, we will do what we have done successfully in the past and focus on what we can control. We will manage the business to ensure we remain a vital valued partner to both customers and vendors and ensure we are well prepared to capitalize on our strengths and accelerate out of the curve.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Al.\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our first quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2025 outlook. First quarter gross profit of $1.1 billion was up 5.5% year-over-year on a reported basis and 7.2% year-over-year on an average daily sales basis. This was above our original expectations of low single-digit growth as our teams captured increased demand for client devices, cloud, security and services in a dynamic environment.\nWe also saw a pull-forward of demand for client devices that was most acute in the education channel, but also had a minor influence on other channels. In total, we estimate that we benefited by approximately $100 million in net sales or 2 percentage points of growth in the quarter. In line with our expectation, gross margin of 21.6% was relatively consistent with 2024 levels, down 20 basis points year-over-year.\nGross margins held firm even with strong client device performance, which comprised 33% of net sales, up from 29% of net sales in the first quarter of 2024. The higher contribution from client device sales was partially offset by higher contribution from netted down revenues. Nevadan revenues contributed a record 36.5% of our gross profit compared to 35.1% in the prior year first quarter and 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOur netted down category solutions listed as transferred at a point in time or CDW's agent in our earnings release and filings represents an important and durable trend within our business alongside our professional and managed services listed as transferred over time or CDW's principal. We continue to expect [indiscernible] revenue streams to outgrow the rest of the portfolio, driven by consistently strong cloud infrastructure and SaaS growth.\nEBITDA revenues increased 12% and year-over-year in the first quarter on an average daily sales basis. Moving on to a quick review of our end markets for the quarter. On an average daily sales basis, all of our channels grew on a year-over-year basis. Corporate and small business produced top line growth for the second consecutive quarter. In the public space, Education had a strong above seasonal quarter as schools both refreshed aging devices and tried to get ahead of potential tariff-related price increases.\nWhile the government channel remained challenging, the team achieved our expectations and help customers navigate a complex environment. Health care was a standout performer again this quarter as the team delivered mission-critical outcomes enabled by our strategic investments. International grew driven by strength in the U.K. from PC refresh activity and full stack wins with public sector customers, while Canada faced macroeconomic impacts that muted spending. We still expect volatility in international end markets. Customers in these regions face ongoing economic and political uncertainty.\nOverall, I want to credit our teams for delivering above our expectations in a rapidly changing market. Our performance shows we continue to meet our customers where they need us most. Turning to expenses for the first quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $678 million, up 2.8% year-over-year. This increase was due to higher gross profit achievement. The efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit was 60.4%, down 170 basis points from the 62.1% in Q1 2024, reflecting typical leverage and our disciplined approach to expenses.\nCoworker count at the end of the quarter was approximately 15,100 and customer-facing coworker count was 10,850 both relatively unchanged quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our goal is to balance growth, expansion of capabilities, an exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations.\nNon-GAAP operating income was approximately $444 million, up 10% versus the prior year driven by expense leverage on our gross profit growth. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.5% was up from 8.3% in the prior year first quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $287 million in the quarter, up 9.9% on a year-over-year basis, impacted by slightly higher interest expense following our debt refinancing last year and lower interest income primarily due to lower cash balances.\nWith first quarter weighted average diluted shares of $133.5 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.15, up 11.9% versus the prior year first quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5.2 billion up roughly $40 million from the fourth quarter of 2024. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion.\nThe 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 15 days, down 1 day from the prior year first quarter, down 3 days from year-end 2024 and below the low end of our target range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including disciplined management of our inventory levels even as client device sales accelerated.\nAs we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $249 million in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and reflecting 87% of non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2025 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $200 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. As a reminder, we're targeting 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in 2025. We are clearly ahead of pace through Q1.\nThat brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income growth. We have increased the dividend for 11 consecutive years through 2024. We continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the first quarter at 2.5x net leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 3x. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility as evidenced by our 2024 debt refinancing and redemption actions.\nFinally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth, as shown by our recent acquisition of Mission Cloud Services. Likewise, we remain committed to a target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases.\nNow turning to our outlook. While the strength we saw in the first quarter emanated from solid underlying demand, we also saw some customers trying to get ahead of potential tariff-related price increases, contributing roughly 2 points of our year-over-year net sales growth. We have contemplated this pull forward into our seasonal view understanding it does not change the full year 2025 overall.\nWe came into 2025 with an appropriately prudent outlook. And despite the strong start to the year, we believe this environment calls for continued prudence. We are laser-focused on controlling what we can control and supporting our customers as only we know how to do in this dynamic environment. Our outlook assumes frictional impacts in the government and education channels and a level of general economic uncertainty caution, but it does not factor in recessionary conditions.\nAs always, as the landscape changes, we will provide you updates each quarter. With these factors in mind, we are holding to our full year 2025 view of low single-digit growth for the IT market. We continue to target market outperformance and of 200 to 300 basis points on a customer spend basis. Based on the anticipated mix of products and solutions, we continue to expect low single-digit profit growth for the full year 2025 and gross margins to remain relatively stable and within the range of 2024 levels.\nWe expect first half gross profit to be slightly lower than the second half but higher than the historical split of 48% versus 52%. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year as we focus on profitable growth, exceptional customer outcomes and an effective execution of our capital allocation priorities.\nPlease remember we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. On that note, we expect currency to be roughly neutral to reported growth rates for the year. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. We anticipate mid- to high single-digit gross profit growth sequentially, leading to low single-digit year-over-year growth. This factors in the pull forward in client device demand ahead of tariffs, and sub seasonal spending in the government and education channels.\nWe continue to expect gross margin to be similar to overall 2024 levels. Moving down the P&L, we expect second quarter operating expenses to increase quarter-over-quarter seasonally aligned to gross profit, but for non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of gross profit levels to be lower than in the first quarter. Finally, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow at a mid-teens rate sequentially to a level that is nearly flat with the second quarter of 2024.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up."

Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2025. Then I will hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. .\nFor the fourth quarter, the team continued its exceptional level of customer commitment and delivered net sales of $5.2 billion, 5% above 2023 on an average daily sales basis. Gross profit of $1.16 billion, flat as reported and up 2% on an average daily sales basis -- on an average daily basis. Non-GAAP operating income of nearly $500 million, 4% below 2023 and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.48, down $0.09 year-over-year or 4%.\nThe fourth quarter delivered a solid finish to a challenging year. During the quarter, as we have seen all year, customer priorities remains laser-focused on operating efficiency and expense elasticity and continually met with as a service and ratable solutions like cloud and SaaS and consultative services in order to optimize spend and minimize capital expenditures.\nAt the same time, customer focus on mission-critical and must-do priorities drove interest in resuming projects with clear short-term returns on investment. This led to an uptick in demand across several hardware categories. Despite this shift in our mix, our durable and stable gross margin held strong and in fact, reached its highest quarterly level in 2024.\nLooking back on the full year, the team's ability to deliver as a service and service offerings helped partially offset the impact hardware deprioritization had on our top line, which declined by 3%, and we delivered full year consolidated gross profit roughly 1% below 2023. Sustaining the resources needed to deliver exceptional service to our customers and support future growth drove slight expense deleverage in both 2024 non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income per share declined by 5% and 4%, respectively. Although 2024 P&L results were not consistent with our record of performance, we once again generated more than $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We stayed the course on our capital allocation priorities and commitment to shareholders and returned $832 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.\nA commitment that was reinforced with today's Board of Directors' action to increase our share repurchase authorization by $750 million. Now let's take a closer look at our fourth quarter performance. As always, there are 3 main drivers of our results: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; breadth of our product solutions; and services portfolio and relentless execution of our 3-part strategy for growth.\nFirst, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: Corporate; Small business; Healthcare; government; and Education. Each channel is a meaningful $1-billion-plus per year business on its own. Within a channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.5 billion. The benefit of our diverse end markets was clear during the fourth quarter. Commercial markets showed signs of stability in the quarter and returned to growth. While customer behavior remained cautious and we did not experience traditional year-end budget flush, we did see greater willingness by some customers to spend their remaining budgets.\nCorporate and Small Business increased their top line, both up by 4%. International or other increased by 5% and public increased 6% driven by Healthcare's standout performance, up 30%. Within public unique end market factors continue to influence Education and government. Education declined 2% as high ed strong performance was more than offset by declines in K-12. As expected, the K-12 market experienced the impact of the first full period without any stimulus-based government funding programs. Government's decline was driven by federal end market uncertainty where we saw spending pauses as agencies awaited clarity around priorities from the incoming administration, clearly, a quarter of varied end market performance.\nThe second driver of our performance this quarter was our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services. Hardware increased top line by 4%, with client devices, NetComm and storage all increasing mid-single digits or better in the U.S. Client Devices growth was primarily driven by normal refresh of aging units. Software net sales were up 5% as robust double-digit SaaS and IAS growth continued to be impacted by the market transition away from licenses. Customer spend and gross profit both increased mid-single digits.\nCloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and once again was a meaningful contributor to gross profit. Cloud profit increased by mid-teens. Security was a top contributor to cloud and software results and delivered high single-digit top line and profit growth. Customers continue to leverage our growing services capabilities as part of their strategies and services top line increased 10%. Overall services delivered double-digit profit growth. CDW Managed Services increased more than 20%.\nAs you can see, our deep and broad portfolio of solutions enable the team to address customers' most pressing priorities, and that leads to our third driver of results, relentless commitment to our growth strategy. During 2024, we maintained our strategic fortitude and patients. We continue to build upon our productivity and efficiency work and further strengthen our relevance to our customers, coworkers and partners. One way we are strengthening and differentiating our relevance is by deepening our technical and industry expertise. We know more than anything that customers value our unbiased, highly informed point of view. A point of view that enables our ability to architect and implement full stack multi-branded solutions, which cuts through the noise and deliver outcomes that address each customer's unique needs.\nSitting side-by-side with the C-suite at the table, CDW industry experts add value to the decision process and move us up the stack. CDW Healthcare offerings showcase this expertise, our deeply experienced Healthcare subject matter experts include more than 2 dozen former industry executives. These former CIOs, CTOs and practitioners have been crucial in developing and launching solutions only possible by combining very deep industry-specific expertise with our extensive portfolio and capabilities.\nSolutions like our proprietary patient room next AI and IoT-based solution and innovative Healthcare transformation centers located across the U.S. Healthcare transformation centers are collaborative spaces equipped with the latest technology and staffed by experts where Healthcare organizations can explore new content, develop strategies and test customized solutions.\nSolutions that improve patient care and clinical workflows across the care continuum. One center is capable of running a 2,000 bed hospital complete with a stand-alone isolated data center and simulation lab, and another center is focused on exploring scalable and evolving technologies for enhancing quality of life for those aged 50 and older. These transformation centers deliver measurable clinical outcomes. Outcomes like reduced readmission rates, where real-time access to patient data is combined with advanced analytics, so providers can identify at-risk patients and intervene before they are readmitted, and outcomes like enhanced patient satisfaction, where mobile communication tools and solutions deliver greater engagement and streamlined care coordinations, driving higher patient approval scores.\nOutcomes all made possible by our strategic focus on enhancing our expertise and our capabilities in the fastest growth, highest relevance cloud and software vectors. During 2024, we maintained a patient and opportunistic stance towards capital investment. When the target and the timing was right, we leveraged our cash position and strong free cash flow. And on November 27, we closed our acquisition of Mission Cloud Services a premier AWS partner and leader in driving cloud adoption and migration. Mission complements recent investments we have made to drive greater scale in our services and -- as a service offerings. Investments and capabilities that include cloud migration, full stack and cloud-native software development, DevOps engineering, robust consulting and cloud-based workflow automation expertise and resources.\nMission expands our AWS Connect opportunities and delivers a compelling managed service offering that can be purchased through AWS Marketplace, allowing customers to burn down their cloud commits. We know how powerful this can be. Let me share an example of a solution that combined professional and managed services with AWS Connect and AI. It's an example of how we help a customer drive efficiency find cost savings and improve the customers' experiences and outcomes in today's challenging environment.\nA financial solutions company's on-premise contact center needed an upgrade. After careful evaluation, the CDW team designed a flexible custom solution that improved both customer service and streamlined operations. The solution includes cloud-based compute database and business intelligence that uses AI-driven analytics and natural language understanding. The project began with a multi-hundred thousand dollar initial investment in CDW delivered technical and implementation services that provided strong ROI to the customer.\nThe Solution represents a significant monthly spend commitment to CDW for cloud-based customer service agent access to customer data and managed services for continuous performance monitoring. This integrated hardware, software and services solution reduces high maintenance costs, improve scalability, agent performance, customer experience and enables innovative customer service solutions from a data-driven insight.\nIt's an excellent example of the power of integrating managed and professional services with our full portfolio of cloud and AI offerings. Solutions made even more compelling with mission in the family. While we have more to do our investments in high relevance, high-growth areas over the past 5 years have positioned us well to deliver value to our customers, however they need us. That leads us to our view for 2025. We currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow by low single digits in 2025 on a customer spend basis and for us to outpace market growth by 200 to 300 basis points.\nThis outlook factors in expected impact from unique market dynamics on the public spending side, particularly in federal and Education as well as expected intensified pressure for our U.K. and Canadian operations, given their market face increased uncertainty driven by macro factors and political change.\nAs always, we base our view of IT growth and what we are seeing in the market and what our customers are telling us about their plans and priorities for 2025. Right now, our commercial and public customers' decisions remain deliberate with ongoing project scrutiny, pursuit of short-term ROI and continued large project buying hesitancy. While our market view recognizes the potential for meaningful exogenous factors to impact demand, including policy uncertainty, the level inflation, the impact of tariffs and other potential disruptors, it does not weigh these wildcards too heavily.\nFor now, we are comfortable with our prudent outlook. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, out-execute the competition. Whatever the conditions, we will use all of our competitive advantages to outperform the market. Our customers face proliferating data and ever-expanding cybersecurity needs. They face expanding workloads and hardware obsolescence.\nAt the same time, they face the potential and promise of AI and other exciting innovative technologies. With our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services and capabilities, we will be there for our customers as their trusted adviser, today and tomorrow, wherever their priorities lie.\nNow let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on the financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our fourth quarter performance. provide a brief 2024 full year summary, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2025 outlook. Fourth quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was roughly flat year-over-year, but up 2% compared to the prior year factoring in 1 less day. This was above our original expectation of low to mid-single-digit declines as our teams captured increased demand for cloud, security services and certain hardware products. In line with our expectations, gross margin of 22.3% was up 50 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the highest margin quarter of the year but below the record level of 23% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nCompared to the prior year, the decline in gross margin was due to a higher contribution from notebook and desktop sales and a modest contraction in margin rate across a few product categories. Netted down revenues represented a strong 35.8% of our gross profit compared to 35.4% in the prior year fourth quarter. We continue to meet customers where they need us most. The netted down category of solutions represents an important and durable trend within our business.\nWhile we expect netted down revenue streams to outgrow the rest of the portfolio over time, driven by consistently strong cloud and SaaS growth we may see variance in growth from some of the other netted down categories, including warranties and software assurance as we did this quarter. Moving to a quick review of our channels for the quarter. On an average daily sales basis, the commercial business, achieved top line growth for the first time in 2 years, alongside firm gross margins. In the public space, Education was roughly seasonal and its sequential decline. And while government remained challenged, the sequential decline was less than historical levels. Healthcare was a standout performer this quarter as our team outperformed in a challenging end market, reflecting the strategic investments we've made in this space.\nInternational net sales grew for the quarter, driven by product volume growth but will behind historical fourth quarter sequential growth rates due to a lack of budget flush activity. We still expect volatility in the international end markets as customers in these regions face ongoing economic and political uncertainty. Overall, I want to credit our teams for delivering above our expectations in a tough environment.\nTurning to expenses in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $656 million, up 3.3% year-over-year. Compared to our prior expectation for SG&A to be roughly flat year-over-year. This increase was mostly due to higher gross profit achievement. The efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit was 56.8%. Coworker count at the end of the year was approximately 15,100. While customer-facing coworker count was approximately 10,900, both down 300 coworkers from the third quarter and flat to last year. These numbers take into consideration both our acquisition of Mission Cloud Services and the actions taken in the fourth quarter to align our expenses to market conditions. Our goal is to balance growth, expansion of capabilities and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations.\nNon-GAAP operating income was approximately $500 million, down 3.8% versus the prior year, driven by lower gross margins year-over-year combined with higher expenses. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.6% was down from the record 10.3% in the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $333 million in the quarter, down 4.7% on a year-over-year basis, impacted by slightly higher interest expense following our debt refinancing and lower interest income due to modestly lower rates.\nWith fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $134.4 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.48, down 3.7% versus the prior year. Shifting gears to briefly review full year results. 2024 was the second consecutive year we experienced a challenging environment. Demand was below what we initially anticipated and customer sentiment was cautious throughout the year with more deliberation and decision-making and elongated sales cycles. Net-net, this led to a 1.8% decline in net sales and a 1.1% decline in gross profit.\nDespite these declines, gross margins held firm year-over-year at 21.9% versus 21.8%, showing that even when client devices are stronger, and solution hardware is weaker, our margins remain resilient. Our strategy investments are working. Investments like the recent acquisition of Mission Cloud Services which brings capabilities which should position us well for growth in the future.\nAs always, we will continue to pivot to meet customers where they need us, no matter of the environment. Down the P&L, we saw higher year-over-year non-GAAP expenses as we pivoted to adjust our fixed cost base to align to an uneven demand environment and made judicious investments in support of our strategy. This led to year-over-year decline of 4.5%, 4.4% and 3.6% and our non-GAAP operating income non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively.\nMoving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5.1 billion, up roughly $253 million from the third quarter and approximately $69 million since year-end 2023. This was driven by our use of cash during the quarter, notably to fund our acquisition of Mission Cloud Services. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion.\nThe 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, up 1 day from the prior year and at the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including proactive management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted cash flow -- free cash flow was $315 million in the quarter, consistent with our expectations.\nFor 2024, in total, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $1.1 billion and 84% of our non-GAAP net income, achieving our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $146 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. For the year with $332 million of dividends and $500 million of share repurchases, we exceeded our target of returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders finishing the year at approximately 77%.\nThat brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with our non-GAAP net income growth. We announced on our last earnings call, an approximately 1% increase of our dividend to $2.50 annually, our 11th consecutive year in increasing the dividend. We will continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio versus non-GAAP net income going forward.\nOur second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.5x net leverage within our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility as evidenced by our 2024 debt refinancing and redemption actions. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth as shown by our recent acquisition of Mission Cloud Services.\nLikewise, we remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. As such, we are pleased to announce an additional $750 million share repurchase authorization program approved by our Board of Directors. On top of the approximately $588 million of authorization remaining under our current program for 2025 and beyond. And that leads us to our outlook. Customer sentiment remains cautious across end markets. We expect these conditions to persist in the near term but are cautiously optimistic about 25 as an inflection point for the demand cycle.\nCustomers still have a compelling need to address priorities such as workload growth, increasing security threats and aging client devices. And while uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape, may continue to weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware, we anticipate leveling demand for these products, including in areas like NetComm that saw depressed growth rates in 2024, driven by product digestion and after lapping tough 2023 compares. With these factors in mind, our full year 2025 expectation is for the IT market to grow low single digits. We target market outperformance of 200 to 300 basis points on a customer spend basis. Based on the anticipated mix of products and solutions, we expect low single-digit gross profit growth.\nWe also expect gross margin to remain relatively stable and within the range of 2024 levels as we continue to scale up our cloud, SaaS and services businesses, while balancing the prospect of a return to growth in solutions hardware. We expect first half gross profit to be slightly lower than the second half, reasonably in line with our historical seasonal splits of 48% versus 52%.\nFinally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year as we focus on profitable growth, exceptional customer outcomes and an effective execution of our capital allocation priorities. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. On that note, we expect currency to be a slight headwind to reported growth throughout the year. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter.\nWe anticipate mid-single-digit gross profit decline sequentially and relatively in line with historical levels, leading to low single-digit year-over-year growth, and we expect gross margin to be similar to overall 2024 levels. Moving down the P&L. We expect first quarter operating expenses to be similar to both the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2024 on a dollar basis. As we've seen in the last few years, this will result in the first quarter being the highest level of non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of gross profit for the year.\nFinally, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the low single-digit range year-over-year. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.\nAnd with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you."

Thank you for joining us for the CDW Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Carly and I'll be the call coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand over to Steve O'Brien of Investor Relations to begin.\n\nSteven J O'Brien\n\nVP of IR, Arrow Electronics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carly. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today to review our second quarter 2024 results are Chris Leahy, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Al Miralles, our Chief Financial Officer.

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.\nSecond quarter market dynamics played out roughly as we expected. Cautious customer behavior once again elongated sales cycles and drove prioritization of needs over once and cost savings over expansion. Capital investment in complex solutions, particularly those tied to data center and network modernization continue to be downsized or put on hold, and there was growing refresh activity in client devices.\nWhat was not expected were to end market-specific dynamics, a worsening in the U.K. environment and further federal funding challenges. Within the limited demand environment, we continue to help our customers build out technology road maps and our pipeline remains solid in the solutions space. Conversion remains challenging with uncertainty laying on our customers' appetite to spend. The team's value as a trusted adviser and ability to deliver solutions that meet our customers' most pressing priorities drove excellent performance across cloud, security and services.\nPerformance that contributed to strong profitability and cash flow performance made possible by the strategic investments we have made over the past 5 years to bring full stack full life cycle solutions to our customers. For the quarter, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, flat year-over-year with a gross margin of 21.8%, up 80 basis points, net sales of $5.4 billion, which were down 3.6%.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $510 million, down 3.7% with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4%, which was flat and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50, which was down 2.6%. Let's take a look at this quarter's performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Recall, we have 5 sales channels, corporate, small business, health care, government and education each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion.\nChannels are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size and spend which together delivered USD 2.6 billion in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets are typically uncorrelated given the different economic and external factors that impact each of them. Our second quarter results provide a good example of this.\nCorporate posted a net sales decline of 2%. Robust increases in cloud and security supported profitability with a meaningful increase in gross margin. Client devices increased for the second quarter in a row and posted both year-over-year and sequential sales increases of low double digits. Notably, client device ASP sell firm with a mix into higher value, higher functionality units.\nOnce again, servers and NetComm declined as customers continue to undergo technology transitions and absorb capacity. Storage was a standout category increasing double [indiscernible] upgrades of legacy systems. Small business net sales declined 3%. The team's ability to help customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity with cost-effective software and cloud solutions contributed to improvements in both gross profit and margin.\nSmall business did not see significant refresh activity and while increasing mid-single digits sequentially, client devices declined slightly year-over-year in the quarter. Consistent with corporate ongoing postponement of infrastructure investments in net common servers drove low double-digit declines. Public sales declined 2% in the quarter with mixed performance by end market.\nGovernment decreased 6% as growth in state and local was more than offset by a decline in federal. Federal results were further impacted by the delayed fiscal 2024 budget authorization as several key customers did not receive funding releases until late June, weeks later than expected. These released funds face processing delays from the normal years of government as hardware and software orders require solicitation, competitive bids and evaluation.\nWe know that ongoing projects will eventually move forward, but some agencies may pause new projects as they await the clarity around the next administration's priorities. In light of these layers of friction and uncertainty, we do not expect a federal catch-up in the back half of 2024. The state and local team had another solid quarter, up mid-single digits, security remained a key performance driver.\nClient devices increased by mid-single digits both year-over-year and sequentially. While early state and local budget dollars are being allocated to improving citizens' experience at state and municipal agencies, including enhanced AI-powered automated response and messaging platforms. Health care net sales were flat. Security remained a key focus area, and the team delivered robust customer spend and gross profit growth, led by security assessments for cloud migration and identity management.\nDriven by refresh client devices increased by double digits. The team's ability to deliver cloud migration, including moving applications out of hospital data centers, drove excellent cloud performance and contributed to both increased gross margin and profitability. Education sales declined roughly 1%.\nK-12's top line was roughly flat year-over-year while profitability grew. For the second quarter in a row, client device sales increased up mid-single digits as school systems refreshed aged Chromebooks. Security and Cloud remain top priorities, both delivering strong growth in gross profit. Once again, collaboration hardware, primarily smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels declined meaningfully as schools continue to digest the significant purchases made over the past several years.\nWith the sunsetting of ECS funds and upcoming deadlines for [indiscernible] funds at September 30, the team is focused on helping their customers pivot to refresh programs funded through traditional mechanisms. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remain focused on investments to enhance student experience to drive enrollment while doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-single-digit top line decline. Cost elasticity continue to drive strong double-digit growth in cloud. Security remained a top priority, up strong double digits and client devices returned to growth in the quarter, up high single digits, driven by a refresh.\nOur U.K. and Canadian international operations, which we report as other declined 13%. While both teams continue to execute well, the demand environment, particularly in the U.K., worsened during the quarter as the early general election amplified already challenging conditions. U.K. sales declined high teens in U.S. dollars and Canada declined 4% in U.S. dollars.\nGiven current conditions, we expect the U.K. market to remain volatile and under pressure through the back half of the year. As you can see, the diversity of our end markets results is fundamental to the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Category performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions.\nTransactions categories increased during the quarter, while solutions categories declined. Both transactions and solutions increased sequentially in the quarter. At the portfolio level, hardware decreased 5%. High single-digit client device growth and mid-single-digit store growth was more than offset by meaningful declines in NetComm and collaboration.\nSoftware customer spend increased mid-single digits, while net sales were impacted by our strong mix into netted down revenue and decreased by 1%. Services increased by 6%, driven by cloud and security-related services. Once again, cloud was an important performance driver contributing double-digit gross profit growth across software, services and security. Profitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments, both organic and acquired, we have made in solutions and services capabilities over the past 5 years.\nAnd this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, our 3-part strategy for growth, which is: first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the solutions our customers want and need in any environment.\nLet me share an example of our strategy in action as we delivered on a customer's priority in today's challenging demand environment. An insurance company faced early end of life for its [ hyperconverged ] infrastructure equipment, something not contemplated in their already tight budget. Armed with our broad and deep cloud portfolio, our cloud, hybrid infrastructure and services group collaborated to architect a cloud subscription-based solution that delivered cost elasticity the customer's budget could absorb.\nThe multifaceted solutions seamlessly moved on-premise workloads and data to the public cloud, delivered cloud compute, migrated custom and off-the-shelf applications, created a virtual desktop infrastructure and deliver security measures with virtual firewalls, plus it optimized workloads to ensure the customer effectively managed CPU usage, memory and storage further mitigating costs.\nThis comprehensive solution generated more than $1 million in product revenue and a multimillion-dollar CDW professional services engagement. After seeing our cloud expertise in action, the customer engaged us for additional cloud solutions, including identity management and unified cloud call center ongoing managed services. Today, we are one of the customers' most valued strategic partners. A great example of how we're delivering value to our customers, both for today and for the future.\nAnd that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. You will recall that on the last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits. In our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above market. This factored in a modest improvement in demand conditions in the second half of the year. Given real-time feedback from our large and diverse customer base, we now expect current market conditions to persist throughout the year, not get worse, but not get better.\nGiven the market's slow start to the year, without a second half demand pickup, we now look for U.S. IT market growth up towards the lower end of a low single-digit range. We continue to maintain our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above market. Growth will return. The demand drivers are there, workload and data growth, increased security threats, client device obsolescence and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. But customers need greater clarity and confidence, clarity around economic conditions and clarity around the impact of AI on their tech road map and confidence that investments made today will deliver the right foundations and economic returns in an AI-powered future.\nImproved demand conditions are a function of when, not if. Wild cards for the balance of 2024 include the potential of greater macro and geopolitical uncertainty, significant degradation of market conditions in the U.K. as well as unusual uncertainty in the U.S. election. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year.\nWhatever the market conditions, we will remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers gaining share and executing with the discipline and rigor that is CDW's hallmark. And we will continue to play the long game, holding steadfast in our commitment to executing against our growth strategy to ensure we have the solutions and services capabilities our customers need to achieve their mission-critical outcomes.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance.\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our second quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities, and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Second quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was roughly flat, up 0.1% versus the prior year. This is modestly below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter as the aforementioned strength in cloud, security and services was offset by lower demand for NetComm and collaboration hardware.\nConsolidated second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion were down 3.6% versus the prior year on both a reported and average daily sales basis and up 11.3% sequentially driven by seasonally higher demand in education channels and government channels and especially pursuant to client devices. Gross margin increased approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024.\nSecond quarter year-over-year margin expansion was primarily driven by the higher mix in the sales where CDW acts as agent, also known as netted down sales. This category grew by 8.7% and once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 33.2% of our gross profit compared to 30.6% in the prior year second quarter.\nYear-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. The netted down category of solutions represents an important and durable trend within our business, contributing to our ability to deliver enhanced gross margins. It is important to note that netted down sales growth and its impact on our mix of business will fluctuate over time with customer priorities and product demand.\nSecond quarter gross profit was up 11.3% compared to the first quarter of 2024 on both reported and sequential average daily sales basis. While second quarter sequential net sales and gross profit growth were higher than the sequential growth rate seen in the last few years, they were very modestly behind our own expectations as well as historical seasonal upturn we experienced in pre-pandemic years.\nThis reflected 2 factors: longer-than-expected delays in spend from our federal customers related to the prior congressional budget in pass and lower performance by our U.K. business, which is impacted by volatility in the economic and political climates. Turning to expenses for the second quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $673 million, up 3.2% year-over-year.\nExpenses were roughly consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, including an expense efficiency ratio more in line with normal levels. The improvement for the first -- from the first quarter reflected higher gross profit attainment and relatively lower level expenses on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Coworkers count at the end of the second quarter was approximately $15,200, up slightly over the first quarter and year-end.\nCustomer-facing coworker count was also slightly up at approximately 11,000. Our goal is to balance driving growth and exceptional customer experience with efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $510 million, down 3.7% versus the prior year, driven by the combination of roughly flat gross profit and moderately higher expenses year-over-year.\nNon-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4% was flat to the prior year and up from 8.3% in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $339 million in the quarter down 2.9% on a year-over-year basis. With second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $135.6 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50. Moving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5 billion.\nNet debt has declined by approximately $93 million since year-end 2023 primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.9 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up 3 days from the prior year but still at the lower end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s.\nThis cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $138.4 million in the quarter. consistent with our expectations and seasonal business trends. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $503 million and 84% of non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of almost 80% to 90%. First half performance puts us on track to meet our 2024 objectives.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $202 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities.\nOur first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the second quarter at 2.4x, within our targeted net leverage range of 2x to 3x. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity and while maintaining flexibility.\nFinally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $250 million of cash on share purchases and have over $830 million remaining under our current share repurchase program.\nAnd that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023, have persisted well into 2024. The customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent across end markets particularly in the commercial, international and federal channels. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near term, but to modestly improve in the second half.\nAt the same time, we noted a compelling need for our customers to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, an aging client devices. These priorities continue to resonate with customers and were brighter spots in the second quarter, while uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape, weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware.\nGiven these market conditions, our updated full year 2024 expectation is for flat to low single-digit gross profit growth, a view that incorporates both our slower start to the year and our view that the mild recovery we anticipated in the second half is not likely to materialize. This leads to seasonality roughly in line with historical levels, with the first half contributing approximately 48% of net sales and gross profit.\nWe maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023 and much like we've seen throughout the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to up slightly year-over-year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter, we anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year, with no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full year 2023 and the first half of 2024.\nThis leads to roughly normal seasonality compared to historical levels and off of a moderately lower second quarter base. We continue to expect the fourth quarter to be meaningfully lower compared to the third quarter principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect third quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the third quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis, given the higher gross profit performance, but at a similar ratio relative to gross profit. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year.\nFor full year 2024, we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. We currently sit comfortably within that range. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. Who would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up."

Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, our strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions remained challenging, and first quarter results came in below our expectations. .\nFor the quarter, gross profit was $1.1 billion, 2% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $404 million down 7%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $1.92, down 6%. In the first quarter, customers demonstrated caution and concern given heightened macro uncertainty, weighing on capital investment decisions. At the same time, the complexity of the tech landscape continued to ratchet up, particularly given the additional layer of AI and changes in the IT market landscape. This lengthened decision-making as customers deliberated on both how to navigate technology road map and when to spend on infrastructure in a challenging economic environment. While activity was reflected in a solid pipeline with deals being pushed out, our sales and gross profit lagged.\nResults were also impacted by the federal budget [ sale made ], which led to a pause in our federal channel. Bottom line, while many of these factors are beyond our control, we are never satisfied. And as we do not expect decision cycles to improve in the near term, we remain focused on accelerating pipeline growth and using all of our competitive advantages to take share in this low-growth environment.\nDuring the quarter, our teams maintained a high level of engagement, working with customers to implement mission-critical projects, help prioritize and evaluate options, develop multiyear plans and prove out use cases. You see the impact of this in our gross margin, which was a first quarter record and our excellent cash flow, which together reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategy. Whatever the market condition, we are laser focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. To ensure we continue to deliver on this commitment, we remain resolute in our strategy and continue to invest to ensure we have the capabilities to deliver full stack solutions and services.\nBroadly speaking, customer priorities included cost optimization, data protection and workforce productivity. This drove focus on security, cloud and as a service as well as client demand and interest in AI. Let's take a look at how all of these priorities impacted performance. First, customer end market performance. Recall, we have 5 sales channels: Corporate, Small business, health care, government and education end markets. Each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion.\nWithin each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.6 billion in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each of them. Corporate top line declined 3% year-over-year. Decision-making further elongated with heightened focus on ROI and a high level of project scrutiny, given interest rate expectations.\nCloud and security prioritization continued to drive excellent increases in customer spend. and the team capitalized on client device demand and year-over-year client sales were up low double digits. Corporate saw declines in hardware categories undergoing transition and absorbing capacity notably servers and NetComm. Storage, however, was a standout category up double digits, driven by data and workload growth as customers improve efficiency and capture savings from newer solutions. Small Business posted a 7% year-over-year top line decline, but with sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter.\nThe team continued to help customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity which drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend. Consistent with corporate net common servers declined and storage increased. Small business continued to be accretive to overall margins. client devices posted a sequential increase yet remained down year-over-year. Public sales declined 5% from the prior year. Health care declined 2%, transactional performance was positive with an increase in client devices, while solutions declined. Health care performance was similar to commercial with customer caution given the significant focus on cost optimization. Security was also a major focus area, delivering double-digit increases in spend and gross profit.\nState and local mid-teens increase was more than offset by a decline in federal top line and total government declined 1.5%. State and local performance was broad-based with strength across transactional and solutions categories. Client Devices sales increased for the third quarter in a row, up high teens. Public safety remained a key focus area with security up substantially double digits. Cloud adoption continued to gain traction. Federal's mid-teens decline was driven by the congressional budget impact, which was not resolved until late March. Some activity related to existing contracts continued, including client device refreshes, which drove a mid-teen increase, larger-scale network and data center projects paused. Engagement remains strong, and we expect to pick up and spend once agencies are able to allocate their appropriated funds.\nIt continues to be a challenging environment for education and the segment posted a 10% decline. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remain focused on doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-teens top line decline. Hardware categories declined across the board, while ongoing focus on cost elasticity led to a strong double-digit increase in cloud.\nK-12's top line decreased by high single digits. Client device sales increased by low single digits, with some school systems refreshing aged Chromebooks, several funded via normal operating budgets and not stimulus programs. Audiovisual solutions like smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels posted a substantial decline as schools continue to digest purchases from the past several years. Security remained a top priority in both top line and gross profit increased by mid-single digits. Our U.K. and Canadian international operations, which we report as other continued to experience challenging market conditions and each declined by mid-single digits.\nBoth teams continue to execute well and are leveraging their capabilities to deliver great outcomes for our customers. For the most part, portfolio performance was consistent across customer end markets. Transactional product sales performed somewhat better than solutions and modestly increased sequentially. Both posted year-over-year declines with a greater decline in solutions from the fits and starts of decision-making. At the portfolio level, hardware top line decreased by 4%. Services also decreased by 4% as weakness in services tied to hardware more than offset growth in managed services, which increased by low teens. Even though software net sales declined by 7%, gross profit increased slightly year-over-year. Top line performance was driven by declines in licensed software due to accelerated transitions to SaaS models.\nLet's turn now to the topic that is getting a lot of attention, AI, and specifically what we are doing for our customers in this space. Right now, most of our customers are at the initial stages of the assessment process, developing and analyzing use cases and adopting data governance best practices to deliver insights and ensure end-to-end security. Essentially, they are exploring the art of the possibility and working through the science of exactly how do we do this. This is exciting work for all of us and our customers. The complexity of adopting AI plays to our strength. We know how to bridge the gap between the promise of technology and transformational outcomes. And since deploying AI drives the need for technology investment across the full stack with entry points across the entire stack, we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers, and we are doing that today. To support our customers as they navigate successful AI adoption, we offer 2 broad areas of consulting services. First, connecting AI to outcomes and ROI, which we call AI discovery, and second, a practical approach to implementing AI, including data governance and security, which we call master operational AI transition or MOT, while still early innings, these services are gaining traction.\nWe scoped the broad AI opportunity around 4 areas of focus: workforce productivity, notably end-use assistance and edge devices, high-value use cases broad-scale vertical solutions and full stack where customers rely on us to provide the infrastructure underlying applications and solutions. A great example of full stack is the corporate training and development domain-specific large language model solution we shared with you last quarter. Our broad scale solutions are vertically based. As you know, we have expertise across many verticals, including health care, financial services in many key industry segments, expertise that enables us to deeply understand the unique needs and challenges faced by organizations in these sectors and tailor solutions and services that directly address their opportunities and pain points.\nLet's take a look at a couple of the vertical AI examples. First, our AI offering for the K-12 market. AI presents an exciting opportunity to empower teachers and improve learning outcomes, but it must be done very carefully. Our education team has leveraged its expertise and relationships in this field to offer a safe AI platform that is specifically designed for K-12 classroom with a custom large language model that generates responses from embedded educational content, not the entire Internet. The second example is a proprietary CDW health care solution, patient room next. While AI holds the promise of medical breakthroughs, our solution addresses the intense pressure institutions face to manage costs while sustaining high levels of patient outcomes. Our solution combines AI and connected devices to transform patient rooms, improve care delivery and enhance overall health care experiences.\nThe solution is HIPAA compliant and runs on an end-to-end intelligent platform powered by GPUs, a platform that provides real-time insights from data and automated documentation. One current application serves over 300 beds and builds $4 million in annual licensing. Add to that, the services and equipment we provide for an end-to-end solution like cameras, network connections and servers, and you can see the opportunity this represents to deliver value for our customers and for CDW. Of course, AI will take time to become embedded across our entire customer set. We know that. We have been here before as we've helped our customers adopt cloud. And while the hype cycle is much shorter than cloud, the ARCO adoption is very similar. Bottom line, we are here for our customers today and will be there for them in the future as they continue to ramp their efforts. And that leads me to our thoughts on the balance of 2024.\nYou will recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits and our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above market. Despite the slow start to the year, we still see potential for market growth. Let me be clear that we do not expect to demand hockey stick but do see potential for client device refresh and for improved solutions performance. Wildcards include further dampening of capital investment from sustained high interest rates, worsening of geopolitical issues as well as unusual election year uncertainty.\nAs we always do, we will update our view of the market as we move through the year. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers wherever their priorities lie. As we look ahead, our customers face a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, protect against increasing security threats, manage an aging client device base and navigate all things data as they build out their plans to leverage AI to capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations. Armed with our full stack full outcomes full life cycle portfolio and unique vertical expertise, no one is more prepared to help our customers successfully navigate this period of unprecedented change.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Al.\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with detail on our first quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook.\nTurning to the first quarter. We began 2024 experiencing the same uneven IT market conditions that we faced throughout last year. Caution on uncertainty range. High interest rates and growing pessimism towards the timing of rate cuts but deals under even greater scrutiny and ultimately led to the dampening of capital investment. Customers are evaluating optimizing their IT spending. And while we actively partner with them to build out tech road maps to support their strategies, the overhang of economic and financial uncertainty as the delay in deliberation and ultimate decision-making, exacerbating elongated sales cycles. During the quarter, we were able to capitalize on demand for client devices, as some customers could no longer postpone refresh activity with sales of more complex solutions tied to digital transformation and network modernization were weaker.\nNotwithstanding, we see the potential for both client device refresh activity to continue and for improved future conversion of our solid solutions pipeline. Moving on to the specific results. First quarter gross profit was $1.1 billion, down 2.4% versus prior year and below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter. Consolidated first quarter net sales of $4.9 billion were down 4.5% versus prior year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Gross margin increased roughly 50 basis points year-over-year and partially offset the impact of lower net sales. Gross margin of [ 28.1 ] -- 21.8% was a first quarter record and was broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024.\nFirst quarter margin expansion was primarily driven by higher mix in an [ added down ] revenues. This category grew by 6%, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.1% of our gross profit compared to 32.3% in the prior year first quarter as our teams were successful serving customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. While we continue to expect the mix of netted down revenues to be an important and durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand.\nHowever, even with a higher mix of client devices, margins remained firm in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter gross profit was down 7.8% compared to the fourth quarter on a reported basis. On a sequential average daily sales basis, first quarter net sales decreased 4.4%. While first quarter net sales and gross profit are typically lower than the fourth quarter, we had anticipated a more modest sequential decline as early 2024 customer engagement suggested more balanced spending across categories than we ultimately experienced.\nInstead, the sequential decline this quarter was more in line with traditional seasonality, reflecting continued uncertain conditions impacting the spend of our corporate customers in addition to the congressional budget in past flying spending of federal customers. Turning to expenses for the first quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $660 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, with the first quarter higher than the fourth quarter as we reset some of our variable expenses for the year and accrue for other seasonally higher items. This played out as expected, but our expense efficiency ratio was further elevated due to our lower gross profit production for the quarter.\nAs we scroll forward, we continue to manage discretionary expenses prudently and diligently while balancing this against both our expectations for the year and the need to expand our capabilities and drive future growth. Our discipline was also reflected in our coworker count at the end of the first quarter, which was approximately 15,000 and down slightly relative to year-end 2023. Customer-facing coworker count was also unchanged at approximately 10,900. As we expand our solutions and services capabilities, we are concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations intended to fund these investments.\nFollowing along on Slide 8, we delivered non-GAAP operating income of $404 million, down 7.1% versus the prior year driven by the combination of our gross profit shortfall and flat expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.3% was down 20 basis points from the prior year. As reflected on Slide 9, our non-GAAP net income was $261 million in the quarter, down 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. With first quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately $136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.92 was down 5.5% year-over-year.\nMoving ahead to Slide 10. At period end, net debt was $4.8 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $230 million from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion.\nMoving to Slide 11. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down 2 days from the prior year and slightly below our target range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Despite profit that was moderately lower than our expectations, effective working capital management drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $364 million, as shown on Slide 12. Over the last 12 months, adjusted free cash flow was 104% of non-GAAP net income, well above our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. As we've mentioned in the past, timing will impact adjusted free cash flow throughout the year, but we're pleased with our first quarter performance, and we'll continue to update our outlook on this front as the year plays out.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $52 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024.\nThat brings me to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 13. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024 and growing the dividend in line with earnings. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.3x, down from 2.4x at the end of 2023 and within our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We will continue to manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility.\nFinally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We currently have over $1 billion of availability under our share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook on Slide 14. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023, have persisted into 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. Last quarter, we spoke about a slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending, which has come to fruition and will likely continue in the near-term. However, as we look forward, we continue to see a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices and all things data, as we help our customers build out their plans to leverage AI and capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations.\nOur updated full year 2024 expectation is for low single-digit gross profit growth, reflecting the slower start to the year. We maintain our view that customers will spend their IT budgets in the upcoming quarters, but within the context of historical seasonality. With this also comes an unchanged expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up low single digits year-over-year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 15.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter, we anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year. With no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full year 2023 and Q1 2024. Our first half/second half split is slightly more weighted to the second half than historical levels in keeping with our expectation for the market. However, we still anticipate seasonal quarterly patterns to reasonably hold, including a lower fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Moving down the P&L. We expect second quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the second quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis, but reflecting a more normalized ratio relative to gross profit than we experienced in Q1.\nFinally, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be in the low single-digit range year-over-year. For 2024, we're maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income, assuming a higher level of working capital investments to support growth.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.\nAnd with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

I want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2024. Then I will hand it all -- hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook.\nWe'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Fourth quarter net sales were $5 billion, 7.7% below 2022. Strong growth and operating income margins mitigated the impact of top line performance on profits, and we delivered gross profit of $1.15 billion, 2% lower year-over-year, non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, 1% below prior year and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.50, up 3% year-over-year.\nOur results reflect consistent strong execution by the team, our financial rigor and our ability to deliver solutions and services across the full life cycle full stack. Results delivered under uneven commercial and international market conditions, which continue to drive cautious customer behavior.\nCustomer priorities remained laser focused on operating efficiency and expense elasticity, priorities increasingly met by as-a-service and consumption-based solutions like cloud and SaaS as well as nascent ratable on-premise solutions. The team's ability to pivot to address these priorities drove excellent performance across solutions, including categories that commonly net down on a revenue basis.\nThe impact of this success, combined with ongoing softness in traditional hardware categories resulted in further pressure on net sales. When this happens, we experienced what we saw this quarter, meaningfully dampened net sales growth with very strong gross margins. This phenomenon was not unique to the fourth quarter.\nMarket dynamics drove hardware deprioritization and preference for solutions that net down throughout 2023. And our net sales of $21 billion were over $2 billion less than 2022. Notwithstanding our muted top line, strong execution by the team, underpinned by our full stack, full life cycle, full outcomes go-to-market approach delivered flat non-GAAP operating income, a 1% increase in non-GAAP net income per share and strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, outcomes driven by the strategic investments we have made over the past 5 years to increase the value we deliver to our customers.\nThat is the power of our strategy when combined with our resilient business model. 2023 was the year that truly pressure tested our strategy. The fourth quarter is an exemplary example of this in action. There were 3 main drivers of results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and relentless execution of our 3-part strategy for growth.\nFirst, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: Corporate, Small business, health care, government and education. Each channel is meaningfully -- is a meaningful $1 billion-plus business on its own. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals, we also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.6 billion.\nOften, our customer end markets performed differently given macroeconomic or industry-specific headwinds or tailwinds. This quarter, all but one customer end market experienced a decline in net sales. The profit story was very different, with gross margin increasing across all customer end markets. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of how each end market performed in the quarter.\nCorporate net sales decreased 8%. Top line performance continued to reflect the impact of both netting down and hardware pressure. Momentum remained for projects focused on increasing productivity as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and coworker experiences.\nThe team's ability to meet customer demand for these priorities with as-a-service and ratable solutions drove strong cloud performance. Year-over-year client device declines moderated down mid-single digits compared to the double-digit declines of the first 3 quarters. For Netcom, while network modernization stayed a top priority, customers focused on digesting investments made over the past few years, leading to a long expected backlog normalization and sales declined year-over-year.\nSmall Business net sales declined 13%. Market conditions were consistent with the first 3 quarters of the year, and customer behavior remained cautious. Priorities remain squarely focused on cost management and projects that need to get done. Once again, projects that were launched, the needs remain paused.\nCustomer demand for projects with shorter-term return on investment drove excellent performance in cloud and in total security -- total software, excuse me. Security remains a top priority, and the team delivered strong performance across our broad portfolio of hardware, software and services security offerings. Similar to corporate, small business client device declines moderated in the quarter, down high single digits compared to the prior 3 quarters double-digit declines.\nPublic sales decreased 4% year-over-year as government's mid-single-digit net sales increase was more than offset by declines across our other public end markets. The federal team delivered a double-digit net sales increase as they continued their success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This drove excellent NetCom performance up strong double digits.\nThe team continued its efforts to help agencies optimize their existing cloud environments as well as deliver new cloud solutions. The state and local team delivered a mid-single-digit increase. The team's success enabling cloud-based solutions, especially with budget constrained cities delivered a triple-digit increase in cloud performance. For the second quarter in a row, the team delivered sales growth in client devices.\nHealthcare net sales decreased by 5%. Augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers, driving cost savings and efficiency projects all remain focus areas for our customers. The team drove a significant increase in cloud performance, growth driven by their success helping systems adopt deep cloud portfolio, which includes proprietary health care solutions.\nOur broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to security growth as the team helped customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Education net sales decreased by 12%, with K-12 posting a mid-single-digit decline and higher ed down mid-teens. For K-12, the team continued their success helping schools and their efforts to sustain technology gains over the past several years.\nThis delivered excellent growth in services and cloud, both posting double-digit gains, gains that were offset by the combined impact of a double-digit decline in net comp and low single-digit decline in client device sales. The Hyatt team's success helping universities to address business process transformation efforts contributed to double-digit growth in services and cloud.\nClient devices showed stability. These encouraging trends were more than offset by declines in NetComm this quarter. Other, our combined U.K. and Canada business declined by 14%. While the teams continue to execute well, market conditions were as expected. And sales in both the U.K. and Canada decreased by double digits in local currency.\nOnce again, our diverse end markets contributed to our performance amid an uncertain and uneven environment. The second driver of performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Let's take a look at how each category performed. The market did not experience the stabilization in hardware we expected and net sales of our hardware portfolio declined by high single digits.\nThis was primarily driven by double-digit year-over-year declines in NetComm as the normalization of backlog adversely impacted year-over-year growth. Client device performance improved sequentially with a low single-digit decline. Software customer spend increased by high single digits but given the significant portion of the category that nets down, net sales declined.\nStrength was broad-based across software as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment. Growth was particularly strong across security, virtualization and application suites. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to gross profit. Customer spend increased across all end markets with roughly half of spend from commercial customers.\nInfrastructure as a Service, productivity and security were the top 3 cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase and customer spend increased by low single digits. Our teams continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement by Getty and access management solutions and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security.\nServices was a standout category this period with double-digit increases in professional and managed services. Integral to today's complex technology solutions, customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage our services capabilities as part of their strategies.\nOur portfolio performance leads to the third driver of our results this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. Core to our growth strategy are our objectives to expand and enhance our solutions and services capabilities. Over the past 5 years, investments, both organic and nonorganic, including 10 acquisitions have bolstered our expertise and resources in these 2 key areas to support our full stack, full life cycle, full outcomes go-to-market approach.\nInvestments that have grown our capabilities in high-growth complex areas like cloud migration and cybersecurity that have enhanced capabilities like full stack and cloud-native software development, DevOps engineering, robust consulting and cloud-based workflow automation, expertise and resources and investments that have expanded our services footprint across the U.S. and Canada.\nAs you can see, each investment we made is purposeful and delivers a specific capability that furthers our strategy, a strategy designed to ensure we evolve with the market and constantly fortify our leading position as trusted adviser to our customers and vendor partner of choice.\nEvolving with capabilities that underpin our relevance and ensure we are there for our customers today and as new technologies come to market, new technologies like artificial intelligence. With its extremely short high cycle, our customers are increasingly seeking opportunities to use AI to achieve their objectives. And while most customers are in the discovery phase, some are already adopting AI with our help.\nHere's a great example. An industry-leading semiconductor and software designer needed training and development for a domain-specific large language model to support a range of internal use cases. The data-intensive and highly proprietary nature of the company's designs and intellectual property made the use of a hyperscaler LLM and cloud-based compute and storage resources less optimal.\nThe CDW hybrid infrastructure team worked with the customer to build a custom platform that supports both training and inference workloads for generative AI. The team designed the underlying architecture, which included a best-in-class 60-node supercomputer with a high-performance parallel file system storage solution. The successful installation and customer handoff resulted in a multimillion dollar hardware and software engagement and services opportunity.\nWith both usage and use cases growing quickly, the company has engaged CDW to support further expansion of their existing infrastructure and to evaluate new solutions. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy have elevated our relevance to customers to the highest level it's ever been. Our focused and disciplined execution of our strategy continues to make us a vital technology partner, whether enabling customer priorities that require high complex or transactional solutions.\nAnd that leads us to our 2024 outlook. The uneven market conditions we experienced throughout 2023 have persisted into 2024. Customer decisions remain deliberate and restrained with ongoing project scrutiny pursuit of short-term ROIs and continued buying hesitancy particularly around hardware. With this backdrop, we currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow by low single digits in 2024 on a customer spend basis, including the expectation of a slow start to the year, a view that incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards, including upcoming elections and geopolitical issues.\nFor CDW, these conditions set up a year that thematically looks much like 2023, and our outlook assumes the growth of customer spend outpaces our net sales growth. Our customers face proliferating data and ever-expanding cybersecurity needs. They face expanding workloads and hardware obsolescence and they face the potential and promise of exciting new technologies. With our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services, we are there for our customers today and tomorrow, wherever their priorities lie.\nWe are there for our customers as their trusted adviser to help them navigate increasingly complex technologies. Whether growth comes from consumption-based or as-a-service solutions or from hardware sales, we are well positioned to continue our track record of profitably outpacing U.S. IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points.\nAs we always do, we will provide an update -- an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on fourth quarter performance, briefly touch on full year 2023 results, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook. The team's strong execution and our financial discipline delivered very strong quarterly gross and operating margins and growth in our fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis.\nWe achieved these results on consolidated net sales of $5 billion, which were 7.7% below 2022 on a reported and average daily sales basis. Fourth quarter net sales performance reflected both our ongoing success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drove meaningful customer spend and profits and the continued impact of uneven market conditions that we experienced throughout 2023.\nOn a sequential average daily sales basis, fourth quarter net sales decreased 10.8%, while historically, fourth quarter net sales are lower than the third quarter, the sequential decline this quarter was more significant than we expected, reflecting a lack of hardware spending recovery, a continued mix shift into solutions that net down and generally softer economic conditions impacting our international end markets.\nFourth quarter gross profit was $1.2 billion, down 2.3% versus prior year, with our gross margin increasing 130 basis points year-over-year and partially offsetting the impact of lower net sales volume. Gross margin of 23% was driven by one factor, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin.\nCloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced overall net sales growth. For the quarter, this category represented a high 35.4% of our gross profit compared to 30.7% in the prior year fourth quarter and was also up from the third quarter's 32.6% level. While we expect the mix of netted down revenues to be an important long-term durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand.\nTurning to expenses for the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $635 million, down 3.5% year-over-year. Prudent and diligent management of discretionary expenses and our overall fixed cost base helped to hold the line on profitability amidst the challenging IT spending environment. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 15,100, up slightly from the third quarter and flat relative to year-end 2022. We continue to expand our solutions and services capabilities while concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations.\nFollowing along on Slide 9, our flexible business model and financial discipline helped to deliver non-GAAP operating income of $519 million down 0.8% versus the prior year despite our contraction on the top line. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached 10.3%, up 70 basis points from the prior year and up 40 basis points from last year's 9.9%.\nAs reflected on Slide 10, our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. With fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately $136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was up 2.8% year-over-year. Shifting gears briefly and moving to Slide 11 to review full year results.\nWe experienced a persistently challenging environment in 2023. Uncertainty for our customers cause reevaluation and optimization of their tech spending, which combined with a marked shift in spending mix, led to a full year decline in our net sales of 10% on both the reported and average LA sales basis.\nDespite the top line decline, gross profit was approximately flat, down 0.7% for the year. This gross profit stability exemplifies the impact of our strategy over the last 5 years with both organic and inorganic investments, underpinning the team's ability to pivot to our customers where customers need us no matter the environment. Enhanced gross margin combined with effective cost controls resulted in a full year non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.5% with non-GAAP operating profit dollars similarly down just 0.6% year-over-year.\nMoving down the P&L. Our net interest expense was slightly below our full year expectations, driven by higher interest income earned on our cash balances. Our tax rate was within our expected range. As shown on Slide 12, our non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 0.4% and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $9.88, up 0.9% from the prior year.\nMoving ahead to Slide 13. At period end, net debt was $5.1 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million from the third quarter, reflecting our increased cash position and modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.8 billion.\nMoving to Slide 14. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down 4 days from the prior year and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we have mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital in any given quarter or year.\nWe continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove a record full year adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion on shown on Slide 15, representing 106% of non-GAAP net income and well above our stated rule of thumb at 6.7% of net sales.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. For the full year, this translated to $322 million in dividends and $500 million in share repurchases, a combined $822 million return to shareholders or approximately 58% of adjusted free cash flow.\nThis was within our initial target range for the year and slightly below our updated range due to stronger-than-expected cash flow in the fourth quarter. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 16. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income.\nLast November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. In 2024 and beyond, we will continue to target a 25% target ratio growing the dividend in line with earnings. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with targeted net leverage ratio.\nWe ended 2023 at 2.4x down from 2.6x at the end of 2022 and within our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value.\nFor 2024, we will target returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In lockstep with this, we've announced the Board's authorization for a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program. Combining our prior authorization with this new additional authorization, we currently have approximately $1.1 billion of availability under a share repurchase program as we start 2024.\nAnd that leads to our outlook on Slide 17. The uncertain market conditions we operated under 2023 have persisted into early 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. And while indicators suggest a compelling need to address workload in data growth, rising security threats and eventual client device obsolescence, our current expectations for a slow start to the year for IT spending and full year growth in the low single-digit range.\nWith this customer spend scenario as our baseline, we additionally expect to profitably gain 200 to 300 basis points of share in 2024. As you know, when we mix in and netted down solutions, the impact is fully reflected in our gross profit, but it is muted in our net sales growth. Conversely, when hardware volume was strong as we saw in 2021 and 2022, our net sales growth is stronger as these products are accounted for on a full gross accounting basis.\nGiven the impact of shifting customer priorities on our net sales and the inherent accounting differences that result from different business mix, we believe that gross profit has become a more effective barometer for gauging our growth expectations.\nAs such, beginning with 2024 and go forward, we will align our outlook with a view on gross profit in lieu of net sales. Based on our current view of mix and margin rates across our portfolio, our expectation for 2024 is for low to mid-single-digit gross profit growth. This assumes a flat to modestly higher gross margin relative to full year 2023.\nFinally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up mid-single digits year-over-year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 18.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter. We anticipate gross margin comparable to 2023's level albeit lower than Q4 and leading to low single-digit gross profit growth on a year-over-year basis. Moving down the P&L. We expect operating expenses to be higher to begin 2024 compared to Q4 as we accrue for a reset of compensation expense that was more muted at the end of 2023 along with other seasonal workforce expenses.\nWe expect operating expense leverage as a percentage of gross profit to gradually improve as the year progresses and expenses even out. Finally, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the low to mid-single-digit range year-over-year. As we start the new year, we are also adjusting our approach on the outlook for adjusted free cash flow.\nAgain, given the variability of mix of business and the corresponding impact on net sales, we believe the relationship between adjusted free cash flow to non-GAAP net income will provide a more consistent metric going forward. For 2024, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. It is important to note that while we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain environment, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability margins and cash flow to our stakeholders just as we did in 2023.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up.\nThank you."

My name is Sam, and I'll be coordinating your call today.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Steve O'Brien with CDW Investor Relations to begin. So Steve, over to you.\n\nSteven J O'Brien\n\nVP of IR, Arrow Electronics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sam. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today to review our third quarter 2023 results are Chris Leahy, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Al Miralles, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings release was distributed this morning and is available on our website, investor.cdw.com, along with supplemental slides that you can use to follow along with the call.\nI'd like to remind you that certain comments made in this presentation are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. The team continued to execute extremely well under persistently challenged conditions. Commercial markets remained cautious and conditions in international markets worsened. Public markets held firm.\nFor the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, 8% lower than last year, record non-GAAP operating income of $55 $56 million, up 1% year-over-year and record non-GAAP net income per share of $2.72, up 4% year-over-year. Record profitability that underscores the power of our strategy when underpinned by our resilient business model and financial rigor -- profitability driven by relentless execution and profitability that is a clear demonstration of the value we deliver to our customers. Customers maintain their laser focus on mission-critical priorities and optimizing costs. And once again, our deep and broad portfolio enabled the team to pivot to solutions that address our customers' priorities. Solutions that provide operating efficiencies and expense elasticity like burstable performance in modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments or solutions that are usage-based like SaaS and private cloud. Solutions, we are well positioned to deliver.\nIn today's environment, where customers are closely scrutinizing their IT spend. Our value as a trusted adviser is greater than ever before, an adviser who helps customers cut through complexity and evaluate options, an adviser who designs, deploys, integrates and many times manages the solution. capabilities made possible by the investments we have made in our 3-part strategy for growth, investments that enable us to serve customers across the full stack and full life cycle, investments that have made us a vital technology partner. As we have executed our strategy, the amount that customers spend with us has consistently grown faster than net sales, a dynamic that reflects both the success of our strategic investments and increasing customer preferences for cloud and SaaS-based solutions. Recall that these offerings drive significant customer spend that are netted down in our sales and thus dampen our top line growth while enhancing our gross margin.\nLet's take a deeper look at quarterly results. There were 3 main drivers of performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our breadth of solutions and services portfolio and ongoing execution of our 3-part strategy. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our 5 sales channels, corporate, small business, health care, government and education is a meaningful business on its own with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act countercyclically, given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each. You see the benefit of our balanced portfolio again this quarter with public performance partially mitigating declines in commercial. Commercial market conditions continue to weigh on customer confidence and drive cautious purchasing behavior.\nInstead of the modest improvement in hardware we expected, we continue to experience pressure, particularly in client devices. Corporate net sales decreased 12% and Momentum continued around projects focused on increasing productivity as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and cover experiences. With a shorter-term ROI lens, customers favored solutions enabled by cloud, which contributed to double-digit increases in corporate customer spend on cloud. AIN Security were also major customer focus areas with CIOs increasingly being asked 2 questions. What are you doing with AI and how are you projecting our data? While AI remains in early stages of commercialization and development and not yet translating into meaningful customer spend, our full portfolio of security offerings contributed to double-digit increase in security spend. Ongoing network modernization also led to excellent net comp performance, once again up double digits.\nCorporate top line performance continued to reflect meaningful year-over-year client device declines with ongoing cofilment of upgrades and utilization of existing products. Small business net sales declined 22%. Market conditions were consistent with the second quarter, and customers continue to see clarity around the economy and more conducive conditions for hiring and new business formation. Focus remains on cost management and the prioritization of products projects that need to get done. Projects that were more warrant rather than needs remain cost.\nConsistent with the second quarter, solutions increased up low single digits, while transactions declined by double digits. Focus on shorter-term ROI for mission-critical priorities drove double-digit spend in cloud and software. Client devices continue to drive small business top line performance as refresh remain on the back burner and declines were on hard with the second quarter. Public sales increased 1% year-over-year. Health care and education each posted a 2% increase, while performance was flat in government compared to last year's exceptional near 40% growth. Government performed relatively in line with historical seasonality, with Federal's mid-single-digit growth, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local. The federal team continued its success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent server performance up strong double digits. The team also continued its work with agencies to optimize existing cloud investments and deliver new cloud solutions, which require rigorous proof of concept.\nThe state and local team delivered solid sequential growth well above the historical averages, up 4%, but net sales declined mid-single digits compared to last year's double-digit growth. Solid Solutions growth was more than offset by a decline in transactions. Cloud-enabled solution adoption was strong, delivering double-digit increases in customer spend. Healthcare net sales increased 2%. Augmenting talent needs modernizing data centers and driving cost savings and efficiency projects remain focused areas for customers. With complex industry challenges and tight operating budgets, health care systems continue to turn to cloud solutions, armed with our full portfolio, which includes proprietary cloud-based health care solutions, the team drove a significant increase in cloud spend. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to a double-digit increase in security spend growth as they help customers address heightened cybersecurity needs, needs driven by the disproportionate percentage of all ransomware attacks that target health care organizations.\nFor education, net sales increased low single digits, the first positive growth quarter for education in over 8 quarters. K-12 low single digits increase more than offset a low single-digit decline in higher ed. Higher ed high single digits increase in Solutions was offset by a double-digit decline in transactions, a decline largely driven by ongoing declines in client devices. Institutions continue to invest to improve security, campus connectivity and student experiences. The team's continued focus on delivering these impactful solutions led to double-digit growth across NetComm, services and software. It also delivered low teens growth in cloud spend. For K-12, the team continued their success helping schools and their efforts to achieve digital equity and improve learning outcomes, which delivered excellent growth in services and Netcost. Solutions grew meaningfully, while transactions declined low teens, reflecting ongoing moderation of client device spend, security remained a key focus area with double-digit growth in customer spend.\nOther, our combined U.K. and Canada business came in below our expectations, down mid-teens. While the teams continue to execute well, the deterioration in market conditions in the U.K. and Canada were deeper than we anticipated, both the U.K. and Canada decreased by double digits in local currency. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and enable consistent performance amid an uncertain and uneven macro environment. The second strategic advantage and driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio, which enables us to pivot to address our customers' evolving needs. Similar to the second quarter, solutions sales increased mid-single digits, while transactions remained under pressure, down high teens. Hardware declined by double digits. Similar to the second quarter, performance continued to reflect depressed client device demand, particularly in the commercial space.\nOverall, client performance was roughly in line with the second quarter's double-digit decline. Net comp increased double digits with stable demand. Backlog continues to feather out and is now approximating historic levels. Cloud spend increased nearly 20% with increases across every end market. roughly half of our total third for cloud spend came from commercial customers and half from public. Security spend increased by double digits with a significant portion being delivered via software and the cloud. Cloud and security success contributed to a mid-teens increase in software increases across virtualization and network management and security were partially offset by declines in categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels. Solid managed and professional services growth was more than offset by the impact of continued drag from lower services attached to transactional and solutions hardware and overall services net sales declined.\nAs you can see, performance varies significantly across the portfolio. That is the power of our deep and broad portfolio. It enables us to meet our customers where they are and it is power driven by the investments we have made in our growth strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. a strategy guided by 3 pillars: first, capture share and acquire new customers; second, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions area; and third, expand services capabilities. Over the past 5 years, we have broadened and deepened our capabilities. Our comprehensive life cycle management capabilities now deliver design, deployment, integration and management. Capabilities that have deepened our relevance to customers and fortified our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally and capabilities that drive favorable outcomes for our customers. In today's uncertain macro environment, with customers increasingly reluctant to make big upfront capital investments, our ability to deliver the cost savings outcome of our eye care framework is a major competitive advantage.\nArmed with our consultative approach to problem solving, the teams both identify and implement consumption-based solutions with lower upfront costs, solutions that enable customers to move ahead with mission-critical projects. Solutions that deliver value to our customers and deepen customer relationships. Many of these solutions are enabled by our Cloud Ready investments, enablement and migration services, which are second to none in the industry. A great example of this in action is a solution we provided to an Illinois school district that had a legacy converged storage environment reaching end of life. The customer had 3 priorities: first, student teacher and administrator experience. Second, agility to meet -- agility to meet end of school year deadline; and third, deliver costs that they manage within the constraints of their fixed budget. After a comprehensive evaluation of the wide range of on-premise and hybrid cloud solutions we can provide the team determined that a consumption-based approach would provide the best outcome for the customer ultimately developing a private cloud hyperconverged solution. A solution that supports deployment and management of modern applications and provides the ability to seamlessly scale for future growth, one that delivered needed flexibility and cost predictability and deepens our relationship as a trusted adviser, another great win-win.\nInvestments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market, and that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. You will recall last quarter, we shared our expectations for the U.S. IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumes 3 things: First, greater clarity in the market would lead to a modest improvement in the commercial IT hardware market in the back half of the year. Second, a moderate deterioration in the U.K. and Canada; and third, a return to normal seasonality in the public space. We did see a return to normal seasonality in public and while commercial spend has been stable there was a greater shift to solutions that net down in lieu of IT hardware spend. We also saw a deeper-than-expected international market deterioration. Current conditions and order today customer interactions lead us to expect these trends to continue.\nOur estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2023 remains at a high single-digit decline, and we continue to expect to profitably outperform the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points when adjusted for this year's meaningful shift in customer spend to our complex solutions that net down. We are cognizant of the significant wild cards to our customers in the market space in this environment, a list that has grown more complex and now includes intensifying geopolitical instability and potential for federal government shutdown. We will continue to keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors as we always do, and we will provide an update on business conditions on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. This quarter, our continued execution and financial discipline delivered 3 notable records: record gross margin, record operating margin and record earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these records on consolidated net sales of $5.6 billion, which were 9.4% in 2022 on a reported basis and down 8% on an average daily sales basis.\nThird quarter net sales performance reflected both the impact of uneven market conditions and our continued success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drive meaningful customer spend. On a sequential basis, Third quarter net sales increased 1.6% on an average daily sales basis, slightly lower than our outlook, reflecting a higher-than-anticipated mix in the cloud and SaaS-based solutions that are netted down, in our top line results as well as economic conditions that adversely impacted our international business. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus prior year as a record gross margin, which increased 200 basis points year-over-year, offset the impact of lower net sales.\nOur gross margin of 21.8% was driven by 2 factors: First, the impact of higher mix in the complex solutions, which have higher product margins; second, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. These cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced net sales growth. For this quarter, this category represented a record 32.6% and our gross profit compared to 31% in the prior year third quarter. While we expect this mix shift to continue to be an important durable trend within our business, eventually, we anticipate a greater mix back in transactional products, which will balance out both the top line growth and corresponding gross margin impacts we've experienced in 2023. For the third quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $671 million, down 1.9% year-over-year.\nCoworker count in the third quarter was approximately 15,000, up slightly from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize investments in our 3-part strategy that are important catalysts for the achievement of our growth, profitability and margin goals. As our customers optimize and rationalize their own IT investments, our disciplined approach to discretionary expenses helped drive non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up $7 million or 1.3% versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record 9.9%, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Moving down the P&L. Our interest expense tax rate remained in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, our non-GAAP net income was $369 million in the quarter, up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis. With third quarter weighted average diluted shares of $136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was also an all-time record at $2.72, up 4.4% year-over-year.\nMoving to Slide 9. At period end, net debt was $5.3 billion or 2.4x net leverage. During the quarter, net debt declined reflect our continued strong cash flow performance and modest debt repayment during the quarter, consistent with our targeted net leverage range of 2x to 3x. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to Slide 10. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 15 days, down 3 days from the prior year and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels, and we expect to remain at the lower end of this targeted range this year. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital in any given quarter. And we continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term.\nStrong profits and effective working capital management drove our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion, as shown on Slide 11, well above our rule of thumb as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation priorities, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $54 million in share repurchases. This brings us to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 12. Our execution remained consistent with the objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. This morning, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually. This is our tenth consecutive year increasing the dividend -- we've grown the dividend at a compound annual rate of approximately 31% from the initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio.\nSecond, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the quarter at 2.4x, down from 2.6x at the end of last year and within our targeted range of 2x to 3x. We continue to convert profits into cash flow and have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocations of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we now anticipate returning 60% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases, up from our prior range of 50% to 75%. All in all, strong results given ongoing economic uncertainty and uneven market conditions. We continue to run our playbook and remain laser-focused on margins, cash flow and predictable profitability.\nAnd that leads us to our outlook on Slide 13. The uncertain marketing conditions we've operated under throughout the year are persisting and continue to lead to customer caution and prudence. Given this, we expect that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we expect to deliver a 200 to 300 basis point growth premium to the market albeit not evident on a net sales basis as the outsized share of netted down revenue makes the impact of our premium. Keep in mind that our premium is most significant when hardware demand is strong, like in 2021 and 2022. We're currently maintain a meaningful premium to the IT market on a customer spend basis. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low to mid-9% range, up from our prior expectation of approximately 9%. This reflects our expectations of continued growth stronger profit margins along with expense efficiency as we manage through this uncertain economic environment.\nFinally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation of flat based on our strong third quarter profitability and relatively unchanged profitability expectations for the fourth quarter. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 14. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. For average daily sales, we now expect a largely seasonal mid-single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to a low- to mid-single-digit net sales decline on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. This is lower than we previously expected and reflective of both the current business conditions and top line mix components previously referenced.\nWith this, we also anticipate gross profit and non-GAAP operating margins to be strong, similar to third quarter levels driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year. For full year 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately 6% of net sales, above our prior year expectation of 5% and well above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5%, reflecting our strong cash generation in the first 9 months of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margin and cash flow to our stakeholders while continuing to invest behind our strategy.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call as usual with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and our views on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook.\nWe'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our team executed extremely well in a market facing persistent challenges. As expected, commercial top line remained under pressure and public return to more normal seasonality. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, down 9% in U.S. dollars, down 8% in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $530 million was up 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 was up 3%. These results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an ongoing period of economic uncertainty, our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enabled the team to pivot to where our customers need us most. An ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high-growth solutions and services.\nWhile transactional business remained under pressure, increases in solutions contributed to meaningful margin expansion. Margin expansion that, together with ongoing expense discipline, delivered strong profitability. Let's take a look at this quarter's key performance drivers.\nFirst, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our 5 sales channels, Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government, and Education, is a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size.\nTeams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act countercyclically, given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each.\nOur second quarter results provide an excellent example of this. Economic uncertainty continued to weigh on the commercial market, and both our Corporate and Small Business results reflected ongoing cautious customer behavior. Caution that, once again, drove elongated sales cycles, smaller deal sizes and greater focus on mission-critical projects.\nCaution that also drove customer focus on short-term ROI. And with both Corporate and Small Business posting double-digit increases in cloud spend. For Corporate, overall sales declined 16%. Mission-critical projects continue to move forward and slowly ticked up throughout the quarter.\nLarge commercial customer spending sequentially improved. Continued postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing product resulted in a double-digit decline in client devices. While we remain cautious on the outlook for client devices, Corporate delivered its first sequential volume increase in the past 4 quarters, providing some indication of demand stability.\nNotably, client device ASPs held, buoyed by mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Momentum around projects focused on increased productivity and enhanced customer and coworker experiences, and that drove excellent growth in cloud spend. Implementation of network modernization projects delivered double-digit NetComm growth.\nSmall Business declined 21%, reflecting the impact of ongoing caution by economically sensitive customers. Client devices continued to decline with upgrades on hold, pending greater clarity around the economy and employment. Focus on mission-critical priorities around security and efficiency drove double-digit customer spend increases in both cloud and software.\nPublic performance partially mitigated commercial market pressure and was seasonally higher than the first quarter. Sales increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in Government, another quarter of stable performance in Healthcare and an upturn in Education.\nGovernment increased 12% and continued to benefit from strategic efforts to target complex services-enabled hybrid infrastructure and cloud opportunities. Federal delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, largely driven by the team's ability to help agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent net common storage performance.\nLegacy Sirius relationships contributed to significant growth in services. The state and local team also delivered double-digit growth. Excellent services performance reflected the team's success, helping state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagement.\nCloud adoption drove strong software and security performance. Health care performance was relatively flat. Talent needs and data center projects remained focused across -- remain focus areas as customers increasingly leverage technology to address complex industry challenges.\nCustomer hesitancy around cloud continued to dissipate and adoption increased meaningfully in the quarter. Client devices remained under pressure given ongoing customer focus on mission-critical projects that deliver short-term return on investment.\nIn Education, the double-digit increase in higher ed was offset by significantly improved but still lower year-over-year performance in K-12, and overall sales decreased 1%. Higher education institution's ongoing emphasis on student enrollment drove investments in enhanced security as well as campus connectivity and dorm room experiences.\nThe team's ability to deliver these solutions drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, storage, software and security. Client devices were flat as the volume decline was offset by mix into higher-value units, which drove strong ASP performance.\nFor K-12, the team continued their success executing on infrastructure opportunities and delivered excellent growth in services, NetComm and storage. This quarter, the team also delivered a sequential improvement in client devices. As you know, the summer season represents the height of K-12 buying. With our June 30 quarter end, we occasionally see anticipated summer sales hit the end of the second quarter.\nWe experienced this in the quarter with anticipated back half refresh driving a significant sequential improvement. Refresh, driven by aging devices and higher than historical breakage rates given more students take their devices off-campus. Other, our combined U.K. and Canada business declined 7%. Similar to the U.S., each team continued to execute well and sustained profitability improvements under challenging conditions.\nU.K. posted a low single-digit decline in local currency, while Canada declined by low double digits. We're seeing growing customer caution in both the U.K. and Canada similar to what we heard from U.S. commercial customers a quarter ago. As you can see, the diversity of end market growth this quarter demonstrates the benefit of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets.\nCategory performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions, which enables the team to pivot and support customers wherever needed. Ongoing economic uncertainty in the commercial space continued to have an outsized impact on both transactions and solutions.\nWhile the rate of decline moderated, transactions were down double digits. Solutions performance improved with mid-single-digit growth versus flat performance in the first quarter. Similar to the first quarter, all 3 of our portfolio categories, hardware, software and services, were impacted by commercial pressure with deferral of major hardware projects resulting in lower volumes in services and solutions.\nHardware decreased 11% year-on-year. Client device performance in the commercial space significantly impacted hardware performance, and Corporate continued to have the greatest category impact. NetComm had an exceptional quarter, posting meaningful increases across all customer end markets.\nThis strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply and continued work on customers' network modernization projects. Services were relatively flat year-on-year. Growth varied widely with strength tied to channel-specific customer priorities, offset by services attached to transactional and solutions hardware.\nProfessional services were solid. And while managed services activity was solid, given extended sales cycles and ratable revenue streams, the impact on net sales was minimal. Software customer spend increased by mid-single digits. Driven by mix into Software as a Service, double-digit increases in network management software and database software were offset by continued declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels and net sales decreased at a mid-single-digit rate.\nSecurity remained a key focus area for customers with spend up single digits. Top growth categories included endpoint security, e-mail security, identity management and physical security. Security associated with growth and business expansion remained challenged.\nOnce again, cloud was an important driver of performance across the business, contributing meaningfully gross profit. Productivity, Infrastructure as a Service and security were the top 3 workloads in the quarter. Each of our customer end markets posted double-digit increases in cloud customer spend and gross profit.\nProfitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments, both organic and acquired, that we've made in cloud capabilities over the past 10 years, capabilities that enable us to deliver for our customers and our stakeholders.\nAnd this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to: first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities.\nEach pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need, today and in the future. Our investment in data analytics is a great example of this strategy in action.\nLike many of our strategic investments, data analytics delivers value across all 3 pillars. Our data analytics capabilities are underpinned by the intimate knowledge we have about our customers, knowledge earned through deep and long-lasting relationships, which range on average over 12 years.\nThey are also underpinned by our broad and comprehensive product portfolio, which provides extensive historical information about buying patterns across industries and verticals. This proprietary customer and product knowledge powers our data analytics that helps create robust and data-driven predictive models. Models that identify customer needs and create personalized and targeted outreach to drive tailored services products and solutions. Solutions that help our customers accelerate their strategies and achieve their missions.\nWe continue to invest in the breadth and performance of these models, utilizing machine learning and other advanced analytics techniques and have produced tangible lift in sales conversion and market relevancy.\nClearly, our investments in data analytics are delivering for CDW. They are also delivering for our customers. Today, we have significant data analytics expertise across server, database, model construction and training. Expertise that delivers outcomes in our eye care framework, particularly in the areas of innovation, agility and experience, expertise that bolsters our consultative professional services capabilities including our AI consulting practice.\nFor CDW, AI adoption feels very much like other transformative technologies of the past. Customers recognize the evolutionary benefits of AI yet they face incredible complexity and choice, complexity and choice that plays to our strength and our value proposition as a trusted partner and adviser.\nAnd just as we have in the past, we have made and will continue to make the investments necessary to ensure we are ready, ready to lead the market and ready to help our customers maximize the return on their AI investments, another excellent example of how we strategically invest for today and the future.\nAnd that leads me to the expectations for the balance of the year. You'll recall on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for the U.S. IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumed a moderate improvement in the commercial environment in the back half of the year and a return to normal seasonality in the public space.\nTo date, the demand environment has been consistent with our expectations, and our view of the U.S. IT market remains unchanged. Within this environment, we continue to target outperforming the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points on an organic constant currency basis.\nWild cards remain, the macro environment, further tightening of credit and the potential for federal government budget disruptions. And as we always do, we'll provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition.\nWe will also continue to judiciously invest to ensure we are there for our customers so they can achieve their mission-critical outcomes, today and in the future. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or end market-specific challenges, a strategy designed to ensure we remain our customers' partner of choice and, most importantly, a strategy that enables us to continue to deliver excellent cash flows and profitably outgrow the market.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more details on our financial performance. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail in the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities, and then finish up with our 2023 outlook.\nTurning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $5.6 billion, down 8.5% on a reported and average daily sales basis. Second quarter net sales were up 10.2% versus the first quarter on a reported and average daily sales basis, ahead of our outlook, which anticipated a mid-single-digit seasonal increase.\nBroadly speaking, our expectation held that the first quarter's uncertain macro environment would persist with our commercial performance coming in as we expected, while public moderately exceeded our expectations. Public results were driven by the strengthened solutions performance across channels and the impact of some early shipping of anticipated client device refresh volume in K-12, leading to return to year-over-year growth and the strongest sequential growth for this segment since Q2 2020.\nOn the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog declined relative to the first quarter which contributed to our stronger solutions performance. Backlog and product lead times associated with transactional products ended the quarter, essentially in line with more normal historical levels, while remaining supply chain challenges in NetComm solutions continue to ease in the quarter.\nWe continue to anticipate the remaining pockets of backlog to feather out over time. As always, we judiciously managed our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our year-to-date free cash flow performance, which we will discuss shortly, reflects this discipline.\nOur team delivered strong profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 1.1%. Record second quarter gross margin of 21% was up 200 basis points year-over-year, an increase in transactional product volume a mild impact on margins compared to the first quarter, but overall margins remained strong, driving a year-over-year gross profit increase despite lower net sales.\nAs a reminder, the record gross margin performance in recent quarters has principally been driven by 2 factors: first, product margins benefiting from both mix into complex solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate; second, a greater mix in the netted down revenues.\nThe category again outpaced overall net sales growing 10% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022, primarily driven by double-digit Software as a Service growth. [ Netted down ] sales represented 31% of our gross profit compared to 28% in the prior year second quarter. This continues to be an important trend within our business.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 8. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. Relative to the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, non-GAAP SG&A was flat as increased payroll expense associated with modestly higher coworker count was offset by the prudent management of discretionary expenses during the quarter.\nCoworker count at the end of the second quarter was approximately 14,900, down from the first quarter, principally due to our efforts to align our cost structure with a level of business demand, while continuing to prioritize the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers.\nStrategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our 3-part strategy for growth. important catalysts for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $412 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $530 million, up $14 million or 2.6% versus the prior year.\nThe difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was larger than usual, primarily the result of the workplace optimization charge in the quarter, which is detailed on Slide 8 and 11.\nNon-GAAP operating income margin reached a record -- second quarter record of 9.4%, up 100 basis points from the prior year and up 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. We remain laser-focused on delivering leverage on our gross profit growth despite challenging market conditions.\nMoving to Slide 9. Interest expense was $58 million, approximately flat to the prior year and relatively in line with our expectations. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 10, was 25.7%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $91 million.\nTo get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%.\nAs you can see on Slide 12, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $136 million GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.92. Our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.56, up 3.2%.\nMoving ahead to Slide 13. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $204 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, net debt was relatively flat, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage ratio within the range of 2 to 3x.\nLiquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion. Moving to Slide 14. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 14 days, down 4 days from the first quarter, 5 days from the prior year second quarter, and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s.\nOur cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to inventory. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital favorably or unfavorably in any given quarter. We continue to believe our target range remains the best guidepost for modeling future working capital.\nOur effective working capital management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $684 million, as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $196 million in share repurchases.\nThat brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually.\nGoing forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the second quarter at 2.6x, flat to the end of the first quarter, and within our new range of 2 to 3x. We continue to convert cash profits into cash flow and have a rigorous process in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining our flexibility.\nFinally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases.\nMoving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. We continue to see caution and prudence in the market and in the sentiment of our customers. Given this, there is no change to our previously shared expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits.\nOur baseline review -- baseline view incorporates a modest recovery in the second half of 2023. We have not seen indications that would suggest a major turnaround in our commercial channels otherwise. With this scenario as our baseline, we maintain our expectation to help grow the market by 200 to 300 basis points and continue to anticipate that netted down revenues will grow faster than other product and solution categories.\nKeep in mind, in times of hardware softness, our over performance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa. We also continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, modest tailwinds in the second half after seeing modest headwinds in the first half.\nThis assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to continue to be in the range of 9%. This reflects our expectation of continued strong gross profit margin with modest softening following 3 straight quarterly gross margin records.\nOperating margin is also supported by our actions to better line expenses. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of flat year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation, reflective of our better-than-expected second quarter results.\nPlease remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook and a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. For average daily sales, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth from Q2 to Q3.\nThis equates to a mid-single-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. As noted, we anticipate gross profit and [ NUI ] margins to be below second quarter levels, driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to slightly down year-over-year.\nIn 2023, we expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, above our rule of tonnage of 4% to 4.5%. And reflecting our strong cash generation in the first half of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margins and cash flow to our stakeholders.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated reviews -- views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask either of you to limit your questions to one, with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CDW Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover today. I'll begin with an overview of our results and our outlook, and Al will provide a deeper view into the financials as well as an overview of our capital allocation priorities, and then we'll move right to your questions. Market conditions were turbulent with a marked down shift in demand as the quarter progressed, translating into lower business volume. For the first quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, 16% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down 6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.03, down 8%. While clearly not satisfied with these results, our excellent cash flow and record gross margin reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategy. So let's take a look at what happened in the puts and takes of the quarter.\nFirst, what happened. In short, demand was weaker than anticipated in our commercial business. When we exited 2022, our forecast called for a moderate softening of IT demand in 2023 and a mid-single-digit year-over-year decline in first quarter sales. As the quarter progressed, IT demand weakened more than expected as a confluence of events intensified already heightened economic concerns and recession fears. This led to a fairly rapid shift in customer behavior, most notably in our large commercial customers. Projects that drove cost reduction, productivity and financial returns were prioritized. Project justification and budget scrutiny ruled the day. And although deals were not canceled, sales cycles elongated, written sales slowed and deal sizes compressed.\nWhile all of this translated into lower sales, the value of the solutions we provided customers continue to grow. You see the impact of this in our gross margin momentum. Margins were consistent with last quarter with meaningful year-over-year expansion in each of our customer end markets. But unlike the fourth quarter, our strong margins did not fully offset the magnitude of our net sales decline. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of the quarter by customer end market. Recall, we have 5 sales channels: Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government and Education, each a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion.\nWithin each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each as was the case this quarter. The shift in large commercial customer behavior had an outsized impact on corporate results with sales down 17% year-over-year. Declines were particularly steep in client devices, servers and storage.\nThree meaningful hardware categories that require capital outlays, outlays under pressure and out of favor. The corporate team's success helping customers achieve ongoing network and application modernization led to excellent NetComm performance. up double digits. Momentum continued around projects focusing on increasing productivity and enhancing customer and coworker experiences, which drove strong growth in cloud and software spend. The small business team posted another quarter of solutions growth, driven by success helping customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity, priorities that drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend on pace with recent quarters.\nNetwork upgrade activity also drove a high single-digit increase in NetComm with resilience in demand for solutions, the gross margin of the small business channel continued to be accretive to overall margins. Strong solutions performance was more than offset by the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty on transactions and small business net sales declined 23%. Public sales declined 12%. Performance in government and healthcare held firm as organizations called on CDW to help them extract more value out of their IT footprints while education remained under pressure.\nSolutions momentum in health care was strong, driven by continued success helping customers adopt technology to drive productivity as an offset to higher costs from rising labor and materials inflation. Cloud performance was excellent, has a hesitancy over privacy concerns waned and health care systems embraced the speed and efficiency that cloud solutions can deliver. Talent needs and data center projects remain focused areas, with customers increasingly using technology to address complex industry challenges.\nPatient care and patient experience continue to be mission-critical, driving ongoing investment in collaboration solutions. However, similar to our commercial markets greater focus on shorter-term ROI and tight budgets resulted in elongated client devices replacement cycles and overall sales were flat. Government activity levels were strong. The credibility and track record of the combined and now fully integrated teams of legacy CDW and Sirius opened doors and led to more seats at the table. Since the first quarter is a seasonally light quarter for both federal and state and local spending, our progress is a bit harder to see. Federal's low teens growth was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local, and sales were flat to last year.\nFederal growth was balanced across solutions and transactions categories. The team's ability to help civilian agencies achieve their priorities around data management, drove strong server and storage performance and contributed to high single-digit growth in solutions. Services increased high teens and Cloud spend remained strong. Underscoring the value of our diverse end markets, federal posted year-over-year transactions growth, which was driven by client, video and audio and collaboration.\nState and local low single-digit growth in solutions reflected the team's success helping customers address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Double-digit Cloud spend was driven by both software and security upgrades. Consistent with the fourth quarter, customers made do with their current client devices and client device declines continued. For education, solid higher ed growth was more than offset by the year-over-year declines in K-12 and overall sales declined 27%. The Higher ed sustained their track record of enabling student success programs used to promote enrollment. These programs, which are focused on improving security, campus connectivity and delivering enhanced dorm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, storage, software and security.\nK-12 posted another quarter of excellent solutions performance. Solutions mid-teens increase was driven by networking and data center efforts with substantial double-digit increases in storage, servers and NetComm. Our ability to wrap services around applications and physical security drove excellent services performance. The K-12 team's solutions performance was more than offset by a meaningful year-over-year decline in client devices and overall sales declined. Similar to last year, customers placed a lower priority on client devices as schools reach student-to-device ratios near or at parity and continue to digest endpoint investments made over the past several years.\nInstead, schools were focused on networking and data center needs as well as planning for the next horizon of multi-funding -- multiyear funding opportunities. Opportunities, which, given the expertise that we have in this area will generate even more ways to serve this important customer channel. Our U.K. and Canadian operations, which we report as other, continued to execute very well in the quarter, delivering consistent profit performance as customers prioritize strategic investments and solutions. Similar to the U.S., top line growth for both markets experienced the impact of heightened economic uncertainty which especially impacted client device demand. U.K. decreased by mid-single digits in local currency, while Canada decreased by high single digits in local currency. Similar to the U.S., strong gross margins reflected higher value mix.\nNow let's take a look at how the end market performance translated into portfolio performance. The economic uncertainty that led to the downshift in our commercial business impacted performance across all 3 of our portfolio categories: hardware, software and services. As a full stack full life cycle provider, the deferral of major hardware projects result in lower attach of services and other solutions. All the components of the deliverables are delayed, pending implementation of the project. Delays in pushbacks and hardware may dampen warranty and security opportunities and focus on in-year ROI often drives compressed deal sizes as many customers elected to favor short-term deals versus multiyear agreements.\nFirst quarter portfolio results were adversely impacted by all these cascading factors. U.S. hardware decreased by 21%, a further step down from the fourth quarter. Large commercial customer client device declines had the greatest category impact as corporations work through the impact of slower hiring and layoffs. NetComm hardware growth was very strong in this quarter and increased across all customer end markets. This strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply but also reflected better demand than we expected. U.S. services decreased 2%. Growth was impacted by weakness in services tied to hardware, particularly in warranties. Momentum in Managed Services growth was solid and professional services continue to grow, though was impacted by the delayed timing of full stack IT integration. U.S. software growth remains strong. Double-digit increases in network management software and storage [ sand ] were partially offset by declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels. Security remained a key focus area for customers, but results were impacted by the shift in large commercial customers' buying behavior and U.S. security sales declined slightly year-over-year. Significant growth in identity management, privileged access management, intrusion detection and risk and government was offset by declines in firewall. Our largest category, which is also tied to either refresh of physical assets or expansion of customers' footprint.\nOverall, security demand remained very strong in small business. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to performance with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led by security, platform and productivity. Within this period of economic uncertainty and heightened customer caution, our trust and engagement with customers and partners was never stronger, trust and engagement that when coupled with our capabilities and deep expertise, serves us well today and trust and engagement that will serve us well when the temporal shift in demand recovers.\nAlthough volumes are down, our ability to help our customers drive outcomes across the 5 components of our eye care framework, especially cost management right now, continues to drive our customer value. Our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enables us to pivot where our customers need us most. Any ability that and that -- an ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high-growth solutions and services, investments that are exceeding our expectations in both capabilities and performance. Investments like our acquisition of Sirius have maximized our differentiation in the market, provided more and better seats at the table, increased customer stickiness and contributed to our evolution as a one-stop trusted partner.\nA partner with the capabilities and expertise that can help customers achieve the outcomes they need from the technology and solutions they can trust. The strategic actions we've taken have not only strengthened our value proposition, they have also fortified our profitability, contributing to our operating profit margin expansion of more than 100 basis points since 2020. It's our strategy, when combined with our flexible business model, execution rigor and financial discipline that enables our ability to profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market, and that leads us to our view for the balance of 2023.\nThe initial 2023 U.S. IT market forecast we shared with you on our February call was for flattish growth. Given our belief that first quarter business conditions will persist through at least the second quarter, we now look for the U.S. IT market to contract at high single-digit rate for the full year. We continue to target outperformance of the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points. This outlook assumes that we will see a moderate pickup in activity in the back half of the year and anticipates that ongoing economic uncertainty will continue to impact customer behavior.\nWildcards include deeper recessionary conditions, heightened credit tightness and debt ceiling driven liquidity events. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. We are operating in choppy waters right now. We have the strategy, capabilities and discipline to continue to profitably outgrow the market. And while we have a durable processes to manage and align cost to opportunity. Given our expectation for market demand, we have amplified our expense discipline to preserve profitability.\nA hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers whenever and wherever their needs may be. The outcomes technology delivers haven't diminished, and our customers know that we will be there for them regardless of market conditions. CDW is an all-weather team, always adapting and evolving to lead in the market. We have faced turbulent markets in the past and have leveraged our proven business model, unmatched competitive advantages and deep and trusted relationships to come out stronger. We will do so again. Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on the financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CNA Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail in the first quarter. Move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, down 14.2% on a reported basis and 15.6% on an average daily sales basis. Net sales results came in below expectations relative to our outlook. Transactions declined more than expected and despite greater resiliency and while flat year-over-year, Solutions also came in lower than anticipated.\nNotwithstanding the lower-than-expected solutions performance, the decline in transactions drove a mix shift that benefited margins. And as we've shared before, the impact of mixing into a higher relative percentage of solutions and specifically netted down revenue has a dampening effect on total net sales, but tends to bolster gross margins, all else equal. Since we are not the primary obligor on these transactions, several important high-value components of our solutions portfolio, including Cloud, Software as a Service, much of security and partner-delivered services and warranties are recorded on a netted down basis, where gross profit is our revenue.\nIn the first quarter, these netted down revenues and notably SaaS transactions outgrew our overall net sales and represented 32% of our gross profit compared to 31% in the fourth quarter and prior year first quarter. This continues to be an important trend in our business. Sequential net sales were down 6.1% versus the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 7.6% on an average daily sales basis. Our outlook anticipated better than normal first quarter seasonality, given the unusually soft demand in the fourth quarter.\nOur outlook assumes public would have better than historical sequential growth, which it did. It also assumed our commercial channels, corporate and small business will remain firm and deliver close to historical sequential growth levels, they did not. The disconnect came from a downshift in large commercial customer spend, which had an adverse impact on our results. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, roughly 2/3 of the amount was driven by large commercial customer activity across both transactional and solutions business.\nOn the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog did not change meaningfully relative to the fourth quarter. And while the backlog and product lead times associated with transactional products are essentially back in line with normal levels, supply chain challenges have persisted in NetComm solutions and the backlog here remains elevated. We continue to anticipate this remaining backlog will feather out over time as supply conditions ease. So this has been more drawn out than anticipated. As always, we continue to judiciously manage our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our free cash flow performance which we'll discuss shortly is emblematic of this discipline. Our team delivered excellent profitability in the quarter.\nGross profit was $1.1 billion, a year-over-year decrease of only 1%, despite a double-digit decline in sales. Gross profit margin was a first quarter record of 21.3%, up 280 basis points versus the prior year period and down only 40 basis points versus the record fourth quarter. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by similar factors as in the fourth quarter. First, product margins benefited both mix into complex, hybrid cloud solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the first quarter, a greater mix in the netted down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing low single digits in Q1 compared to Q1 in the prior year, primarily driven by double-digit Software as a Service growth; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services mix with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions.\nTurning to SG&A on Slide 8. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $655 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher fixed payroll as our coworker count increased during last year. This was partially offset by a decline in sales payroll expense, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. We expect the impact of the higher year-over-year fixed cost SG&A to diminish as we move through the year.\nTo that end, we are focused on our efforts to innovate our operating model and drive productivity and savings. Given the demand environment, we've advanced initiatives to ensure our cost structure is aligned to our opportunity set. This includes driving structural savings as well as pacing our overall coworker count with the level of business demand and in the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was approximately 15,300 up slightly from the fourth quarter principally due to the most recent acquisition, which added to our technical resources in professional and managed services.\nStrategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our 3-part strategy for growth, an important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $355 million, down $32 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down $28 million versus prior year.\nNon-GAAP operating income margin was strong at 8.5%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, although down 110 basis points compared to the record fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, this year-over-year improvement was driven by our strong gross margin. The sequential decline reflected a higher ratio of fixed costs as a result of the lower volume of net sales and gross profit. Moving to Slide 9. Interest expense was $58 million modestly above the prior year, driven by higher interest rates, but relatively in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 10 was 22.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $66 million.\nTogether non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7%, within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.68. Our non-GAAP net income was $279 million in the quarter, down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.03, down 7.9%. Moving ahead to Slide 13, a period end Cash and cash equivalents were $279 million and net debt was $5.5 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we reduced our overall debt by almost $130 million, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.3 billion. Moving to Slide 14. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down 3 days from the fourth quarter, 2 days from the prior year first quarter and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $411 million, as shown on Slide 15.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 and capital allocation objectives, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends and $200 million in share repurchases in addition to the $130 million in debt repayment. We also closed the acquisition of Locus recruiting in February. That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with our updated objectives we communicated last quarter. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrated our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business.\nGoing forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.6x, flat to the end of the fourth quarter and within our new range of 2 to 3x. We continue to convert business performance into cash generation and have a rigorous process in place to maintain our flexibility and proactively manage liquidity. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities is M&A and share repurchase have remained important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we'll continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned roughly 68%.\nAs a reminder, the Board authorized a $750 million increase to the company's share repurchase program last quarter on top of the remaining dollars from the prior authorization. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. The current overall IT market sentiment reflects the caution and prudence of customers. We expect this to continue in the near term with a modest recovery of demand conditions in the second half of the year. This informs our expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits.\nWith this scenario as our baseline, we look for netted down revenues to continue to grow faster than our other product and solution categories. And we maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points. Keeping in mind that in times of hardware softness, our overperformance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa. We continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be within the range of 9%. This reflects the expectation of lower net sales and gross profit, balanced with higher gross margins and a reduction in the level of our fixed expenses. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings to decline low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 18.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. Related to average daily sales, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. That equates to a low double-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline from the second quarter. We anticipate continued strong margin performance in the second quarter with a gross profit margin consistent with levels in Q1 and NGOI margin higher as expense efforts improve operating leverage. And we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline mid-single digits year-over-year.\nIn 2023, we expect full year free cash flow to be at the high end of our new rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales as we continue to emphasize a return on working capital. While we are clearly operating in a cautious and uncertain environment, given our resilient business model, the rigor of our financial controls, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability margin and cash flow, our stakeholders have come to expect. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

Leahy\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2023 then I'll hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.\nOur fourth quarter was an excellent example of the power of our business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an extraordinary period of shifting customer priorities, we delivered record profitability. For the quarter, net sales were $5.4 billion, $100 million below 2021 and roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, 23% above last year and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.50, up 21% year-over-year, up 22% on a constant currency basis.\nThese results were driven by the team's ability to pivot to meet customer priorities and capture high relevance, high-growth opportunities. This led to excellent performance across services, cloud, security and software. Performance that drove record profitability and exceptional outcome given market dynamics and an outcome that is a direct result of the investments we have made in solutions and services over the past several years. Simply put, our ability to deliver outcomes across the full stack and full life cycle of technology drove strong profit growth, notwithstanding a meaningful decline in client devices. This quarter clearly demonstrates the power of our strategy when combined with the resiliency of our business model.\nSo what happened to client devices this quarter? While we expected some level of contraction in client devices and accessories given the past 2 years of heavy investment, the magnitude of the decline in the fourth quarter was certainly steeper than anticipated. The primary driver was the K-12 market, which represented roughly half of the client device decline. We also saw a general moderation in client device demand across channels as economic uncertainty increased. As we always do, we stayed the course on our playbook and maintained our discipline with a focus on our customer and our value proposition. This discipline contributed to this quarter's excellent cash flows and strong economic returns.\nIn Q4, the combination of lower transactional business and the team's success delivering on customer demand for solutions and services led to a meaningful shift in our sales mix. Let me put this in perspective for you. You've heard us speak over time about the impact of solutions mix and notably netted down revenue streams on our financial results. As we have grown our netted down revenue streams over time, total annual customer spend has consistently grown a few hundred basis points faster than net sales.\nIn periods where we mix into more solutions business that nets down and make out of client device business that fully showed up in net sales, that growth rate spread will be wider. In Q4, an extreme mix shift took place. The result was meaningful customer spend growth, significantly dampened net sales growth and very healthy gross margins that drove delivery of gross profit.\nNow let's turn briefly to the full year results. 2022 as a year of financial performance underpinned by progress on our 3-part strategy for growth. The first pillar of our strategy is to capture share and acquire new customers. One way we do this is through strategic acquisitions. The addition of Sirius is a great example of this. Sirius elevated and expanded our services capabilities, providing an excellent cross-sell opportunity into our existing customer base. At the same time, Sirius customers represent excellent cross-sell opportunity given the broader CDW portfolio.\nThe second pillar of our strategy is to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas. Strategic coworker investments contributed to excellent solutions performance through 2022 with strong growth in cloud, security and network upgrades.\nThe third pillar of our strategy is to expand services capabilities. As a key enabler of our value proposition, services are fundamental to our full stack, full life cycle, full outcomes go-to-market approach. Services engagement solve critical customer problems and drive enduring customer relationships.\nIn 2022, the team delivered more than 20% services growth across the business. No doubt, our acquisitions have accelerated our services breadth and depth and have been foundational to our success. 2022 was indeed a year of strategic performance across all 3 of our priorities. It was also a year of exceptional financial performance. The team delivered record results with constant currency net sales growth of 15% and each profit category down the P&L statement up 20% or more. Results enabled by ongoing investment in our 3-part growth strategy, investments that have made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions.\nYou see the impact of these investments on our fourth quarter performance as the team pivoted to meet customer shifting priorities and advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes. Outcomes that deliver 5 key organizational benefits: innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers.\nLet's take a closer look at the fourth quarter. There were 3 main drivers of our fourth quarter results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and relentless execution of our 3-part strategy. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, health care, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.9 billion.\nOur corporate team delivered another strong quarter with a 7% sales increase. The team helps customers accelerate implementation of priorities to automate tasks, detect fraud and enhance customer and employee experiences. This drove excellent cloud, software and security results. Our ability to address priorities focused on application and network modernization and consumption-based data center solutions led to excellent services and net comp performance, each up double digits. Economic uncertainty led customers to deprioritize endpoint solutions, which resulted in a decline in client devices.\nSmall Business declined 13%. The team pivoted to help customers address priorities to maximize prior IT investments and identify savings opportunities to fund new and ongoing projects. At the same time, the team helped customers address mission-critical priorities around security and take advantage of the benefits of cloud, both with heightened urgency. Strong growth from security and cloud were balanced against the decline in client devices as customers put upgrades on hold awaiting greater clarity around the economy and employment plans.\nStrong results across health care and government cannot offset the decline in education driven by K-12 client device dynamics and public sales decreased 9% year-over-year. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 8%. Talent needs and data center projects remain key focus areas as customers increasingly thought technology solutions to address complex industry challenges. This drove excellent performance in NetComm, servers and services. Mission-critical investments to enhance patient care and experience continued with telehealth and Telesitting driving excellent collaboration performance.\nGovernment grew double digits, up 13.5%. Strong state in local sales growth continued, driven by customer adoption of IT strategies for hybrid cloud, as well as network modernization in Zero Trust security frameworks. Services increased more than 50% as the team helps state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Federal also continued to grow in the fourth quarter. The team's ability to help agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove excellent server and storage performance.\nFor education, higher ed's high single-digit sales growth was more than offset by declines in K-12 and overall sales decreased. Higher ed continued their success helping implement student success programs which institutions use to promote enrollment. Our ability to help drive program elements that include improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhanced storm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, server, storage, software and security.\nFor K-12, we expected a continuation of third quarter performance where sales were down low double digits but instead experienced a more significant decline with client device units down more than 68%. As we shared last quarter, K-12 customers continued to focus on digesting the past several years' investments and evaluating multiyear funding opportunities to ensure they are making the best decisions for the future.\nThis quarter, as many schools achieved 1:1 student-client device ratios, there was a significantly heightened focus on reevaluating plans, and demonstrating need for ECF awards. When the device per student ratio was below 1:1 demonstrating need was straightforward. Today, with device per student at or above the 1:1 ratio, demonstrating need is more complex.\nFor example, articulating why new devices with higher processor capability are required to run more complex applications or provide greater security is just a more complicated discussion and takes more time in approvals. This heightened focus led some customers to defer or retract awarded funding commitments in order to assess, reevaluate and potentially reapply under the third and final wave of ECF, which is scheduled to end December 31, 2023.\nFor CDW, this equated to several hundred million dollars of CDW awarded funding commitments being pulled back. I should note that even with these dynamic variables in the K-12 client devices arena, the team successfully executed on infrastructure opportunities across services, NetComm and servers, leading to strong gross profit delivery. And just as we've been doing in past cycles with K-12, the team will be there for our customers to help them work through the challenges to achieve their mission-critical outcomes and efficiently utilize available funding mechanisms.\nOther, our combined U.K. and Canada results reflected broad-based and balanced performance in both regions in local currency. U.K. increased low double digits in local currency and Canada increased high single digits in local currency. These results continue to demonstrate the grit and resilience of our teams and the power of our investments to drive growth in these markets.\nAs you can see, our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance. The second driver of our performance was the broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered high single digit growth across our solutions portfolio. U.S. hardware sales declined mid-teens. Within hardware, network modernization upgrades drove double-digit increases in NetComm. These excellent results were not enough to offset the decline in client devices and wraparound accessories.\nSupply conditions continued to improve across core transactional areas, while supply and solutions categories remained tight. Once again, we exited the quarter with an elevated backlog and extended lead times in solutions and notably in NetComm. We continue to expect this backlog to feather out over time.\nU.S. software sales increased 8%. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environments with strong double-digit increases in operating systems, application suites and data management.\nCloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability. Once again, gross profit increased by double digits. Compute database, storage, mobility and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period.\nSecurity remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams delivered excellent results as they continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security.\nServices results were stellar again this quarter, up more than 20% with balanced performance across professional and managed services. Services are integral to today's complex technology solutions. Customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage CDW services as part of their strategy.\nAnd that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy contributed to our strong profitability this quarter. Investments in services and solutions have elevated our relevance to customers for the highest level it has ever been. Our rigorous strategic process that is designed to ensure we can serve customers across the full stack, full life cycle has made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. And that leads us to our 2023 outlook.\nOur baseline view of the U.S. IT market in 2023 is for flattish growth, factoring in both expected mix and the level of overall economic uncertainty. Consistent with economic forecast, this outlook assumes stronger growth in the second half relative to the first half. We continue to target CDW market outperformance of between 200 and 300 basis points.\nOur current view of the market recognizes we are operating under greater uncertainty as it incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards and indeed, most notably the economy. With thousands of sellers connecting with customers every day, we have a real-time pulse of the market. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year.\nIn the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our fourth quarter results highlight that although we cannot definitively know where our customers will place their priorities, there are 2 things we know for sure. Technology will continue to be a critical driver of outcomes. And with our agility and broad and deep portfolio, we will be there to support our customers wherever their priorities now lie.\nNow let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nSenior VP & CFO, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the fourth quarter and full year, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook.\nTurning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.4 billion, down 1.8% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales declined 0.4%. Net sales were impacted by the significant change in client device demand during the quarter. With the decline in transactional products, there was a meaningful mix shift to solutions and services.\nBefore moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of mixing into solutions and services on our results. Certain solutions such as Software as a Service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as aging commission fees generate meaningful customer spend but are recorded on a netted down basis. Since we are not the primary obligor on these solutions, we record gross profit as our revenue. That is why you sometimes hear us refer to these net down revenues as 100% gross margin items. You certainly see the impact of this in both our net sales and our gross margin performance this quarter.\nAs we continue to execute on our growth strategy and scale our solutions and services, we expect to continue to grow our netted down revenue streams. All else equal, this mix dynamic will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit dollars and expanding gross margins. While much of what I've described is tied into the accounting treatment, it is also a reflection of our success in the execution of our 3-part strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions and expand services.\nThe impact of this strategy was on full display this quarter as we experienced a significant mix shift out of client devices and into netted down revenues, reflective of our customers' priorities.\nReturning to the P&L. Sequentially, net sales decreased 12.5% versus the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales historically decreased versus the third quarter but this quarter was exacerbated by the declined demand for the client devices. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, 2/3 of lower net sales were related to the public sector and driven primarily by K-12. In aggregate, solution categories delivered results above our expectations.\nNotwithstanding the noted mix shift of customer priorities, with respect to customer behavior, we did see increased scrutiny and deeper evaluation of projects and extra signatures increasingly required. In this environment, our sellers are staying close to their customers and working with their technical coworkers to help customers maximize return on investments. While we've not seen meaningful customer cancellations, we have seen some postponements and rearchitecting on more complex hybrid cloud solutions as customers balance cost and utility.\nOn the supply side, we saw similar conditions as in the third quarter with some improvement across categories but pockets of pressure remaining, especially in the solution space. Our solutions backlog remains elevated versus historic levels and lead times are still extended. We expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions ease, although not likely symmetrical across product categories.\nWe continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers so there's still uncertain supply environment. And just like our customers in this environment, our team is diligently managing working capital as we seek to enable profitable growth while ensuring strong economic returns.\nOur coworkers delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 21.1%, lapping for the first time, a 1-month Sirius contribution in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross profit margin was a record 21.7%, up 410 basis points versus last year and 190 basis points above our prior year quarter record.\nThe year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, product margins benefited from both mix into complex hybrid cloud solutions and lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the fourth quarter, a greater mix in the netted down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing 26% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Software as a Service. And third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 28% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions.\nTurning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $658 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll, consistent with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. SG&A declined by $26 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment.\nIn this uncertain economic environment, we are also being mindful of our discretionary spending and our pace of our hiring. Our fourth quarter expense levels reflect both the benefits of our variable cost model and our prudent expense management. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was nearly 15,100, up approximately 1,100 in the last year and essentially unchanged since the third quarter. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy continue to be integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably.\nWe are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that drive value. This is evidenced by our record profitability in the period.\nGAAP operating income was $447 million, up 31.6% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, up 23.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 9.6%, up 190 basis points from the prior year and 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this improvement was driven by a confluence effect, favorable factors within gross margin.\nMoving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $59 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 24.7%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $94 million.\nTo get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, 30 basis points below our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5% due to lower state taxes as well as nondeductible items.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of 137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.09. Our non-GAAP net income was $343 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50, up 21%.\nTurning to full year results on Slide 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2022 performance reflected exceptional execution, relentless focus and a strategy that is working. Net sales were $23.7 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full year consolidated net sales grew 15.2%. On a combined constant currency basis, we estimate full year sales increased 5%, below our prior expectation of 8.25% due to the moderation in IT market growth as well as a contraction in our premium in the fourth quarter. Gross profit was $4.7 billion, up 31.3% and [grew] 19.7%, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year.\nIn 2022, software and services accounted for more than 40% of the total gross profit. Organic and inorganic investments in our services and solutions capabilities and a continued shift in the netted down revenues are driving growth. Operating income was $1.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $2.1 billion, up 24.6%. Net income was $1.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 19.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $9.79, up 22.9%.\nMoving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $315 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan by $200 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion.\nMoving to Slide 21. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 3 days from last year's fourth quarter and within our range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital.\nOur effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $1.3 billion, as shown on Slide 22. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to $200 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 23.\nOur execution remains consistent with objectives we communicated last quarter. For 2023, we're updating those objectives as follows: first, as always, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio growing the dividend in line with earnings.\nSecond, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.6x net leverage, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash flow generation. As we expected and communicated during the third quarter call, 2.6x had us near the lower end of our 2022 targeted net leverage of 2.5 to 3x. For 2023 and beyond, our targeted net leverage ratio will be 2 to 3x, a range that is consistent with our commitment to an investment-grade capital structure and provides us with flexibility to proactively manage liquidity over time.\nFinally, we have successfully satisfied the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. As such, we are pleased to have reestablished our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A, and share repurchases, respectively in 2023.\nFor 2023, we will target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. This is supported by the Board's authorization for a $750 million increase in the company's share repurchase programs.\nMoving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 24. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivoted growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. While the overall IT market growth rate sentiment has been mixed, in the near term, we continue to expect netted down revenues will grow faster in other product and solution categories. With this in mind, we expect the IT market to be approximately flattish, reflecting our expectation of mix and the level of economic uncertainty. We maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points per year.\nCurrency is expected to be neutral for the full year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar in the first quarter.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid- to high 8% range. We expect full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be at the upper end of a mid-single digit's range in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter. Related to average daily sales, we expect low single digit sequential growth from Q4 to Q1. This equates to a mid-single digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the first quarter. Above the full year 2022 levels for both but reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q4. And we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year.\nFinally, in line with the reevaluation of our capital priorities, we're adjusting our long-term rule of thumb for full year free cash flow. In 2023, we expect full year free cash flow to be within a range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales, up from our prior range of 3.75% to 4.25%. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. That concludes the financial summary.\nAs always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results and then provide an update on our strategic progress and a summary of our outlook. Al will provide additional details on the financials and outlook as well as our capital-allocation priorities. And then we'll move right to your questions.\nWe had an outstanding third quarter. Once again, we delivered all-time record sales, profits and margins. Net sales were $6.2 billion, 17% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $449 million, up 26%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.60, up 22% year-over-year. This exceptional performance is a result of our relentless execution and disciplined investment in our customer-centric strategy, a strategy that underpins our ability to address customer priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full stack and full life cycle of IT.\nThe vital need for interconnected and integrated solutions has created levels of complexity never seen before. We cut through the complexity and help customers maximize the impact of technology, technology that delivers mission-critical outcomes.\nIn today's environment of persistent uncertainty, our customers are increasingly leaning on CDW as a trusted partner, and they look to us to provide unbiased expert advice across the entire spectrum of IT. A trusted partner who helps them tackle their most pressing priorities, pressing priorities like advancing their digital transformation, driving innovation and delivering exceptional stakeholder experiences, along with enhancing security and supporting collaboration in today's distributed environment of work, learn and live everywhere. Priorities that deliver operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable billing and modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments and infrastructure and new technology investments to optimize flexibility and agility. Our ability to enable solutions in support of all these diverse priorities drove broad-based and balanced performance.\nThere were 3 main drivers of our results: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and the relentless execution of our 3-part strategy. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate; small business; health care; government; and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $2 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals.\nWe also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.9 billion. Our portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity and to be there for our customers along every step of their IT journeys. Our collective team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another stellar quarter with a 25% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continued to focus on digital transformation through infrastructure modernization and process automation. The team's ability to deliver these outcomes translated to excellent solutions growth led by NetComm, Enterprise Storage and Cloud.\nBoth professional and managed services posted double-digit increases as the team helped customers achieve their IT priorities by augmenting their technology capabilities with dedicated technologists. The hybrid work environment continues to thrive with continued customer focus on collaboration across workspaces and continued need to modernize their employee experience.\nSmall business delivered growth for the seventh straight quarter, a 5% increase on top of last year's 39% growth. The team continued to help small business customers navigate the impact of technology across all aspects of their business into today's cautious environment and accomplish critical projects that enhance and sustain mission and business outcomes. This drove double-digit performance across software, security and cloud. Our full stack, full life cycle support for customers, which enables us to nimbly shift towards solutions that maximize prior investments led to double-digit performance in services.\nPublic posted a strong 13% increase this quarter. The health care team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 28%. Once again, results were driven by the team's ability to help health care organizations harness technology to drive productivity in an environment of rising costs. Our health care customers are increasingly relying on CDW for talent orchestration and to guide their implementations of cloud resources. Health care organizations face complex business dynamics, but they are committed to mission-critical projects and data center and collaboration modernization continues to move forward.\nGovernment posted 38% growth. Within government, state and local posted a substantial double-digit increase. Our collaboration with customers to identify and capture various funding opportunities is bearing fruit with data center and software projects beginning to advance under multiyear phrasing. The team delivered excellent security results as they help state and local municipalities enhance their defenses against emerging and evolving cyber threats. Remote collaboration continues as a top priority, driving excellent performance across transactional product categories.\nAs expected, federal activity resumed in earnest. Seasonal spending patterns normalized with the September fiscal year-end spending uptick. The team helps customers address their top priorities, including upgrades to collaboration and data management infrastructure. This drove strong growth in nearly all categories compared to last year.\nFor education, higher ed growth was more than offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall sales decreased 7.5%. The higher-ed team continued to deliver student success programs to institutions. These programs promote enrollment through comprehensive endpoint solutions and improved campus connectivity and safety and drive client devices sales and NetComm growth.\nSecurity remains very -- security demands were high, driven by solutions that addressed ransomware and hacking threats through CDW-delivered security enhancements. K-12 performance remains strong on an absolute basis, but was obscured by the team's exceptional client device driven success in 2021. Today, the team is helping school systems determine how to sustain prior IT investments and maintain the learning opportunities provided by digital equity initiatives. At the same time, the team continues to help customers implement industry-leading innovative connective learning spaces as well as enhanced campus safety. And this drove strong security and audio-visual performance during the quarter.\nOther, our combined U.K. and Canada results increased 18% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent local market growth. The U.K.'s performance was broad-based and balanced as our team showed resolved and resiliency in a complex environment. Canada's performance was also broad-based and balanced with customer priorities similar to the U.S. amid a continued shift into solutions and services.\nAll in, the teams delivered another excellent quarter of end-market performance. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance.\nThe second driver of our portfolio -- of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. As technology has become a more vital part of their strategies, customers require comprehensive, integrated and interconnected solutions and services. Our ability to address these priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered double-digit growth across our solutions portfolio.\nU.S. hardware increased 13%. This steady performance was on top of 2021 (technical difficulty) quarter double-digit hardware growth. Network modernization and upgrades drove double-digit increases in Enterprise Storage and NetComm. Video and audio and servers increased healthy single-digit rates.\nCommercial PC performance was strong on a relative basis and even more so when we exclude the year-over-year impact of growth from the K-12 market. Relative to the supply environment, conditions improved across several transactional areas. Despite these improvements during the quarter, our overall backlog remains elevated. We expect the backlog to continue to feather out over the coming quarters. U.S. software increased double digits. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in storage management, application suites and database management. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business. Complexity surrounding cloud has not changed and navigating between multiple options remains a major area of customer focus. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to profitability with both customer spend and gross profit up by double digits.\nInfrastructure as a Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams continue to guide customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation to improve their security frameworks and respond to increasing threats. This drove strong double-digit growth in customer spend.\nU.S. services performance continued to advance this quarter. Customers are leaning into CDW as extensions of their own teams and leveraging CDW services as part of their strategies. This produced broad-based and balanced growth driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's levels and represented 8% of total sales, up from 5% in 2021. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and are a key enabler of our value proposition.\nTo support this, we have been making organic and inorganic investments in services over the past several years and those investments quickly gained traction in the market.\nAnd that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy. Our targeted investments are guided by our 3-part strategy, which is: one, to capture share and acquire new customers; two, to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas; and three, to expand services capabilities. This strategy delivers on our commitments to our customers and drives both our top line and bottom-line performance. Over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our relevance to customers by broadening and deepening our capabilities, including in automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure we remain the trusted adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformations. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital and cloud-based environments in the U.S. and internationally.\nA great example of how our services investments deepen relationships and strengthen the value we deliver to customers is a solution we are delivering to a medium-sized hospital system. With 3 primary hospitals and approximately 70 regional clinics and urgent care facilities, the system was challenged to find, retain and train a sustainable level of technical staff. Having previously worked with them, providing both hardware solutions and professional services to re-architect their disaster-recovery solution, we had a deep understanding of our customers' environment.\nWe coupled with the breadth and depth of our services offering, this enabled us to construct a new design, build, run end-to-end services solution that leverages CDW managed services and talent orchestration capabilities. A solution made possible by the services investments we have made and the technical mastery we've accelerated over recent years, mastery over the broad spectrum of technologies the customer needed for support, including Windows and Linux servers, virtualization, storage, backup and recovery, databases, switching, routing, network access and cloud-based productivity and identity-management tools, our full portfolio of services enabled us to become an extension of the customer's team.\nWe recently went live under a 5-year contract with monthly recurring revenue in the hundreds of thousands and a total contract value over $10 million. A great example of how our investment and services deliver value to our customers and cause them to lean further into CDW.\nInvestments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on our customers delivered significant out-performance to our baseline 2022 outlook. When combined with our current expectations for fourth quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market at the high end of the 325 to 425 basis points range. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%.\nTaken together, this equates to year-over-year constant-currency growth at the high end of the 7.25% to 8.25% range. The high end of the range is applied to the combined CDW 2021 revenues of $22.8 billion, calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021, instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, this equates to a constant-currency increase of 18.5% over 2020 results.\nOur outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that our mix will remain weighted more heavily to netted-down items. We expect this to drive profit growth faster than sales growth, while we continue to thoughtfully invest in our future. We are cognizant of the current environment, but to date, customer urgency to innovate for the future and the internal and external stakeholder demand has not diminished. Of course, we remain mindful of wildcards, including economic, geopolitical and the variable nature of the supply chain, and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors. As we always do, we will provide an updated view on business conditions and our annual outlook on our next call.\nIn the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our flexible business model and proven formula for success will continue to serve us well. The accelerated pace of change makes our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers, more important now than ever.\nNow let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nSenior VP & CFO, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2022 outlook.\nTurning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.2 billion, up 17.3% on a reported and an average daily-sales basis. On a constant-currency average daily-sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 18.7%. Sequentially, sales increased 1.1% versus the second quarter. Third quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio.\nOn the supply side, some conditions improved during the quarter, resulting in an overall reduction in our backlog. While supply and lead times of client devices have indeed improved, pockets of pressure remain, especially in solution categories and our backlog remains very elevated. As we've previously shared, we would expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions can begin to ease and this will not likely be symmetrical across product offerings. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers who is still uncertain about supply environment, and the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital.\nWe once again had an excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34.8%. Gross profit margin was a record 19.8%, up 250 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, as we expected for the second half of the year, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category grew nearly twice as fast as overall net sales, primarily driven by Software as a Service.\nSecond, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 70% year-over-year as a result of our recent acquisitions.\nTurning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $684 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consisting with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was nearly 15,000, up approximately 400 from the prior quarter, reflecting investments in coworkers that support high-growth solutions and services as well as our own digital transformation. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that will pay dividends. This is evidenced by our record sales and profitability in the period.\nGAAP operating income was $466 million, up 20.7% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $549 million, up 26.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.8%, up 60 basis points from the prior year and 40 basis points compared to the second quarter.\nOverall, while we're very pleased with this outcome, it was above our expectations and driven by a confluence of factors within gross margin, including a favorable mix and rate of product margins, which we'd expect to moderate in Q4.\nMoving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $63 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as the effect of higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We have not changed our expectation of approximately $240 million for the full year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 25.4%. This resulted in a third quarter tax expense of $101 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 60 basis points versus last year's rate as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses and state taxes.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, the third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.17. Our non-GAAP net income was $357 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.60, up 22%.\nYear-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $358 million and net debt was $5.8 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under a senior unsecured term loan by $400 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.5 billion.\nMoving to Slide 21. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down 7 days from last year's third quarter and at the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting the impact of Sirius and our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, as shown on Slide 22.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital-allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to the $400 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23.\nOur objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income, including today's 18% increase to the dividend from $2 to $2.36 per share. The increased annual dividend represents approximately 25% of a trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income through September. The Q4 2022 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation in the business and marks the ninth consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 34% from its initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings.\nSecond, we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the third quarter at 2.7x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. While we're at the middle of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.\nAnd finally, while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital-allocation objectives of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on the path to getting back to these priorities.\nMoving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 24. While we're cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivot to growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the fourth quarter will reflect a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted-down revenues as a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins, all else equal.\nWith this in mind, we continue to expect U.S. market growth of 4% and now expect to be at the upper end of our 325 to 425 basis point range of CDW market out-performance in constant currency, on a combined basis. Recall, we previously shared, we would expect to be at the higher end of our premium range if supply improves. Conversely, if we experience elevated levels of supply constraints, or mix more into netted-down revenue streams, we would expect to be at the mid- to lower end of our premium range. On a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius.\nOn a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 18.5% growth in constant currency. The change in currency exchange rates from our initial original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of $110 million to net sales in the fourth quarter and $260 million for the full year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.13 to the British pound and $0.73 for the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter.\nMoving down the P&L. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. This implies the fourth quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of 20% or higher operating profit growth. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 23.5% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis.\nI would remind you that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97 per share, which included only 1 month of Sirius. The change in currency exchange rates from our original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of -- to EPS of $0.04 in the fourth quarter and $0.08 for the full year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant-currency basis.\nAdditional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter, related to average daily sales, we expect a 0 to low single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to 9.75% to 10.75% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the fourth quarter at or above year-to-date average levels for both, reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q3. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 18.25% and 19.25% year-over-year on a reported basis.\nFinally, we now expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, exceeding the top end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. If you recall, 2021 free cash flow was 2.3% of net sales. In aggregate, we expect our 2021 and 2022 free cash flow to balance out and be within our free cash flow rule of thumb over the 2 years.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls.\nAnd with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

Leahy\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone.\nI'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook, and then Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we'll move right to your questions.\nWe had an exceptional second quarter. The teams continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered all-time record sales, margins and profits. For the second quarter, net sales were $6.1 billion, 19% higher than last year and our first $6 billion quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49, also up 23% year-over-year. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customers' priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full spectrum of IT.\nDigital transformation, agility and security remain top priorities, with ongoing focus on hybrid work and return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers also continue to seek ways to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. Our ability to meet all of these needs led to a broad-based and balanced performance and was a result of 3 key drivers: number one, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; number two, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio; and number three, our ongoing execution against our customer-centric strategy.\nLet's take a look at how each contributed to our growth this quarter. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government and Education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own, with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $8 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals.\nWe also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which, together, delivered sales of USD 2.6 billion. This portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity. Each team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another record quarter with a 34% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continue to invest to stay ahead of the curve to either begin or advance their efforts to address the accelerating pace of change.\nDigital transformation drove excellent solutions growth with strong double-digit increases in NetComm, servers, collaboration, cloud and software. Customers are increasingly seeking our advice and expertise in navigating their IT journeys, and this drove strong performance in professional and managed services and warranties.\nAt the same time, corporate customers continue to turn to us to meet their needs for hybrid and return to office solutions, and the team delivered another quarter of double-digit client device growth, reflecting both unit and ASP increases.\nSmall business performance was in line with our expectations and the team delivered a 4% increase on top of last year's 60% growth. This net sales growth understates demand as customers prioritize cloud and software solutions, which are accounted for on a netted down basis. A better barometer of customer demand in the quarter is the gross profit performance of small business, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth.\nDuring the quarter, customer spend increased more than 20% for both security and cloud as customers modernize, optimize and secure the applications running on their endpoint devices. Infrastructure spending is the natural follow-on from remote enablement and return to office demand. Remote enablement remains strong, and the team produced another quarter of double-digit collaboration and client device growth.\nPublic posted an 8% increase this quarter. The health care team delivered another excellent quarter, up 30%. We continue to help our hospital systems and health care organizations leverage technology to mitigate staffing shortages and wage and cost inflation. A great example of this is seamless patient intake and recordkeeping solutions that use biometric security to improve emergency department throughput.\nAnd while health care has taken a more cautious view towards cloud in the past, the benefits of flexibility and reduced IT support burden are compelling more customers to adopt cloud-based solutions, driving a double-digit increase in cloud customer spend.\nGovernment posted 19% growth. State and local performance reflected continued success helping customers maximize the value of their IT investments, leveraging our expertise in professional and managed services. At the same time, the team is helping customers navigate through the complexities of funding programs and the impact on their long-term planning efforts.\nWhile customers generally have until 2024 to 2025 to spend stimulus, data continues to proliferate, and we delivered excellent cloud and storage performance. Remote collaboration continues to be a priority, driving double-digit growth in devices and audio video.\nAs we expected, Federal returned to growth in the quarter. Federal customers prioritize services, tied to solution inception and ongoing management. Similar to state and local, remote collaboration led to double-digit transactions growth.\nAfter the past 2 years of unusual spending patterns, we anticipate a return to more normal season patterns for Federal, including fiscal year-end September budget activity. Higher Ed's strong performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12, and overall education sales decreased 6% off of last year's excellent second quarter performance. The higher ed team continues to help universities enable student success and student access programs using technology to give institutions an enrollment edge. This includes deploying comprehensive endpoint solutions, security and campus connectivity to deliver enhanced dorm room experience.\nK-12 posted a healthy seasonal increase, but remained below last year's exceptional stimulus-driven results. During the quarter, a third wave of emergency connectivity funding, ECF, was announced, which opened July 1 and extends through December 2023, adding complexity to an already broader way of funding. We continue to work with school systems to help identify how to maximize available funding to maintain equity and access IT advancements into the future.\nIn the near term, the team also continues to help educators implement connected learning spaces and to enhance security. Other, our combined U.K. and Canada results, increased 24% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent growth. U.K. was up significantly in local currency and delivered balanced growth across both public and commercial with excellent remote enablement activity. Canada increased double digits in local currency, primarily driven by commercial customers with excellent solutions growth.\nThe second driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum resulted in excellent performance across our solutions and transactions portfolios. Solutions grew twice as fast as transactions. U.S. hardware increased low double digits. Growth was broad-based and included double-digit increases in server and server management and video audio. We also continue to see underlying strength in notebooks across our commercial business.\nClient Devices, NetComm, enterprise storage and printing and scanning increased at a healthy single-digit rate. This exceptional performance was on top of 2021 second quarter double-digit hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in networking and enterprise storage. Customers once again placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in NetComm.\nWhile overall backlog ticked down slightly from last quarter, we exited the quarter with backlog at nearly twice last year's second quarter level. And once again, we leveraged our competitive advantages, including our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge.\nU.S. software increased nearly 40% compared to the prior year. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in storage and network management software, application suites and security software.\nCloud was an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability, with customer spend and gross profit increasing by double digits. Infrastructure as a Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key growth workloads during the period.\nU.S. Services performance was excellent this quarter. Growth was broad-based and balanced driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's level and represented 8% of total sales, up from 5% in 2021 and 2020.\nAnd that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, our customer and coworker-centric strategy. Over the past 3 years, we have relentlessly focused on executing our strategy to enhance our high relevance and high-growth solutions and services fueled by organic and inorganic investments. [8] acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities, including automation, cloud-native and dev ops and cybersecurity, capabilities necessary to ensure we remain the trusted adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation, capabilities that enable us to best serve customers, whether in a physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally.\nThrough our acquisitions, we welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers with more than half in technical roles. Since year-end 2018, our technical team has doubled in size. Today, more than 5,400 presales specialists and engineers work alongside our world-class sellers to deliver the complex digital transformation solution from code to cloud and data center to database that our customers want and need.\nAll of our investments, whether homegrown or acquired, are designed to maximize our key points of differentiation in the marketplace and ensure we continue to help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology so they can do great things.\nLet me share a couple of recent examples that demonstrate how our investments are making a difference for customers. In the federal space, the power of bringing 3 winning teams from CDW, Sirius and Focal Point together is evident in the cybersecurity solutions we are delivering to the intelligence community. Together, the focus is on enhancing our scope across the Department of Defense and civilian agencies.\nTo gain traction in this space, you must deliver proof of concept, which we do with our dedicated Advanced Solutions lab. You must prove training -- you must provide training and support and you need agency-to-agency endorsement.\nWhile the CDW government team already had both expertise and scale, Sirius' federal team brings a track record of success and solution configuration, technical integration and managed services. And our cyber experts at Focal Point Academy deliver the professional training these agencies need. Our relevance to federal customers has never been greater.\nThe second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve great outcomes comes from our small business team. A provider of Software-as-a-Service solutions to pharmaceutical and life sciences companies needed to address their aging data center infrastructure. Their customers' workloads and data were being run on service that were well beyond end of life. The servers clearly were not capable of supporting their existing business, let alone growing their SaaS offerings.\nThe CTO initiated a competitive bidding process for a very small-scale professional services contract to provide proof of concept on cloud migration, starting with a couple of dozen servers. CDW and our competitors all utilize the same public cloud provider, but CDW won based on our experience with migrations, our proven post-migration support and our long-standing trusted relationship with the customer, serving their transactional product needs.\nThe CDW team, bolstered by technical support from our IGNW Digital Velocity professional services team, built a secure landing zone in the public cloud and the proof of concept proved so successful, the customer is now migrating hundreds of servers.\nSeeing the huge burden CDW lifted off the customers' engineering team who are having trouble balancing their day-to-day operations while trying to expand their cloud footprint, the customer contracted CDW for ongoing managed services of their rapidly growing cloud environment. The current annual services opportunity is at $750,000 run rate and is on a path to $1.5 million. By staying close to the customer, CDW once again had the opportunity to help make IT work, allowing the customer to improve the scalability and performance of their software offering.\nInvestments in our customer and coworker-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market, and that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on the customer delivered significant outperformance to our baseline outlook in the first half of 2022.\nGiven this excellent performance, we continue to expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than both our long-term average level of outperformance and our original view at the end of year 2021. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%. Taken together, this equates to constant currency growth of 7.25% to 8.25% above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall 2021 combined, CDW is calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021, instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1.\nOn a reported basis, our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results on a constant currency basis. Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that we will mix into more sales of solutions in the back half of the year, notably cloud and security. Given this expected change in second half mix, we also expect to deliver profit growth faster than sales growth, even as we continue to invest in our future. Our outlook also continues to reflect our expectations that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year.\nWhile we're cognizant of economic headlines to date, we have not seen a change in behavior that would impact our view on the second half of the year. Of course, we remain mindful of economic risks as well as other wild cards, including the potential for further disruption to supply and changes resulting from COVID incidents rates. We will keep a watchful eye as always on these and other potential issues. And as we always do, we will provide an updated view on customer activity and our annual outlook on the next call.\nIn the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best: leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we are remaining our customers' trusted technology partner of choice, helping them deliver the business outcomes they need.\nNow let me turn it over to Al who will provide more details on our financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nSenior VP & CFO, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail in the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook.\nTurning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.1 billion, up 19.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 20.5%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 1.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio.\nOn the supply side, consistent with last quarter, we saw pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The change in our overall backlog compared to the first quarter was insignificant. Year-over-year, our backlog remains elevated in both transactional and solution categories, and we continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this uncertain supply environment. The team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital.\nWe had excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 32.3%. Gross profit margin was a record 19%, up 180 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, increased netted down revenues, primarily within Software as a Service as the category continued to grow faster than overall net sales. Netted down revenues represented 28% of total gross profit; second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and resilient demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales and high-margin professional service business nearly doubled as a result of our recent acquisition.\nTurning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was nearly 14,600, up roughly 3,900 from the prior year quarter, reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.\nInvestment in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are seeing our disciplined and balanced investments pay dividends as evidenced by record sales and profitability in the period.\nGAAP operating income was $435 million, up 17.7%. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and 60 basis points from Q1.\nMoving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $58 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as higher interest rates on our floating rate debt.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $98 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 50 basis points versus last year as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per share was $2.04. Our non-GAAP net income was $340 million in the quarter, up 19%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49, up 23% from last year. Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19.\nMoving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $542 million and net debt was $6 billion. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Moving to Slide 20. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 2 days from last year's second quarter and reflecting a tighter spread between DSO and DPO. Year-to-date free cash flow was $717 million, as shown on Slide 21. This is higher than a typical first half, reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management.\nFor the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends and further reducing our net leverage ratio, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 22. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter.\nFirst, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings.\nSecond, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the quarter at 2.9x, down from 3.4% at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. And while we're at the top of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius.\nWe continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. And while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priority of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on a path to getting back to delivering on these priorities.\nMoving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 23, starting with sales. Our outlook remains unchanged from last quarter on a constant currency basis, including holding our second half outlook at our initial aggressive baseline. While we're cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we are confident in our ability to execute, pivot to where the growth opportunities are and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the back half of the year will reflect a greater mix in a netted down revenues as we overlap 2021's strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margin, all else equal.\nWith that in mind, our outlook for full year 2022 continues to be U.S. IT market growth of 4% plus 325 to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. Recall that, on a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency.\nCurrency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $120 million to net sales in the second half of the year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.22 to the British pound and $0.78 for the Canadian dollar in the second half. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range if we mix more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experience elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is stronger or if supply improves.\nMoving down the P&L. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. For non-GAAP earnings per share, recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included only 1 month of Sirius. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid-teens, call it 14% to 15% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to a low 20% full year growth rate in constant currency on a reported basis.\nCurrency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.04 to earnings per share in the second half of the year based on the reference exchange rates. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis.\nAdditional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25.\nMoving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We expect a low single-digit increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis. This equates to a roughly 17% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the third quarter. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than reported net sales.\nFinally, we now expect to be towards the top end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales in 2022, assuming current tax rates. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.\nAnd with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. (Operator Instructions). Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine A. Leahy\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook, and Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities, and then we'll move right to your questions. We had an outstanding start to the year. The teams continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered exceptional top line growth and profitability.\nFor the first quarter, net sales were $5.9 billion, 23% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million, up 26%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20, up 26% on a reported basis. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customer priorities with solutions across the full spectrum of IT and the inclusion of Sirius.\nCustomers continue to evolve as we move ahead into the new normal, digital transformation, agility and security remained top concerns with return-to-office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers want to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. At the same time, customers across our diverse end markets are seeking ways to supplement technology resources in today's war for talent environment.\nOur ability to meet all these needs led to a broad-based and balanced performance. There were 3 drivers of our performance during the quarter. The first driver was our broad and diverse portfolio of customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government and Education. Each of these channels is a meaningful business on its own with 2021 annual sales ranging from $1.8 billion to over $6 billion.\nWithin each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.6 billion in 2021 sales. This scale and balance across customer end markets positions us to perform when external factors impact certain sectors or geographies. This quarter, our commercial markets, corporate and small business, along with our health care and international markets, all delivered strong double-digit growth.\nAs expected, education and government growth was depressed as they lapped strong prior year stimulus and large deal-driven results. Our corporate team delivered a 46% increase. Growth was strong and balanced across transactions and solutions. The team did an excellent job addressing customer demand for return to work solutions, digital transformation and the need for agility and security.\nUnit growth, coupled with ASP increases, resulted in another quarter of strong double-digit growth in client devices and cloud spend was excellent. Small Business posted a 21% increase. Performance was broad-based across both transactions and solutions. return-to-office strategy and modernizing workspaces drove strong collaboration, networking and security growth for hybrid work environment.\nRemote enablement drove another strong quarter of client device growth, up double digits, both in unit and ASPs. Security performance was up mid-teens and cloud spend was robust. Public posted a 6% increase on top of last year's exceptional 20% plus growth. Health care increased 27%, ongoing focus on driving productivity to offset higher costs from staffing shortages and other acute care needs led to double-digit solutions growth.\nCloud adoption was strong driven by the speed and efficiency cloud solutions can deliver. Government posted a mid-single-digit increase. State and local delivered a high single-digit increase driven by client devices and security. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers as they work through the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing and expect projects to continue to be implemented as we move through 2022.\nFederal performance played out as expected and was balanced across both the Department of Defense and civilian while lapping tough compares. As we shared last quarter, we continue to experience the lumpiness, the lumpy nature of government contracts and contracting changes. There is no change to our expectation that growth will return later in the year. Higher ed's strong double-digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 4% off the first quarter of 2021's remarkable 101% growth.\nThe higher ed team continues to help customers implement student success programs using technology to give an institution an edge with comprehensive endpoint solutions, improved security, campus connectivity and enhanced dorm room experiences. The team delivered excellent client device growth and school systems tapped our capabilities to address the war-for-technology talent, which drove increased usage of CDW services to fill the gap in staffing needs.\nWhile K-12 delivered strong nonseasonal results, they posted a year-over-year decline on top of last year's exceptional 100% growth. Emergency connectivity funding, which was expected to end during the first half of 2022 was extended and a third wave was announced, adding complexity to an already challenging process. Many school systems are leveraging the extended funding window to digest better options and plans for their IT spend.\nOther, our combined U.K. and Canada results increased 13% on a reported basis. U.K. grew double digits in local currency and Canada increased high single digits in local currency. Each market saw balanced strength across both commercial and public customers. Customer priorities remain similar to those in the U.S. The second driver of first quarter performance with our broad and deep product and solutions portfolio, our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum drove excellent performance across both our solutions and transactions portfolios.\nWe continue to leverage our competitive advantages, including our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. hardware increased high teens. Growth was broad-based and included double-digit increases in NetComm, servers and server management, client devices and video/audio. This exceptional performance was on top of 2021's first quarter double-digit hardware growth.\nDemand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in the networking space and remaining orders built during the quarter. Customers once again placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in NetComm. U.S. software posted a 40% increase, driven by success helping customers upgrade their edge and secure their IT environments with double-digit increases in network management software and security software.\nCloud was a meaningful contributor to this quarter's strong performance with significant double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led by productivity, platform, security and collaboration workloads. U.S. services sales doubled. Growth was broad-based and balanced driven by professional services, managed services and warranties.\nAs you can see, excellent broad and balanced performance across the business. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, our customer and coworker centric strategy. Over the past 3 years, we have executed against our strategy to enhance our high relevant and high-growth solutions and services with both organic and inorganic investments, 8 acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities, including automation, cloud native and DevOps, cybersecurity and our services scale and reach. We welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers from these 8 acquisitions with more than half in technical roles.\nSince year-end 2018, our technical team has doubled in size. And at the end of this first quarter was more than 5,000 strong. Today, technical coworkers comprise more than half of all customer-facing coworkers, together with their other CDW colleagues, they form an amazing high-performing team, a high-performing team that is a key competitive advantage for CDW, a team that is the most engaged, enabled and energized team in the industry.\nAll our investments, whether homegrown or inorganic, are intended to maximize our key point of differentiation in the marketplace. We are a one-stop trusted partner with capabilities across the entire continuum of IT. -- capabilities that help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent customer examples that demonstrate how our investments help customers achieve outcomes.\nA soft drink manufacturer wanted to upgrade their on-premise voice system. The customer had 2 desired outcomes for the solution. Number one, flexibility to expand as their business grew, and number two, an excellent user experience. Since IT staff was focused on other priorities, the solution needed to be managed off-premise, leveraging CDW's world-class unified communications as a service capability and ServiceNow capabilities, the team designed a flexible and cost competitive integrated full stack managed collaboration anywhere solution.\nThe solution included CDW professional services for upfront design, planning, configuration and deployment and CDW managed services to provide ongoing MCA support and integration with our ServiceNow ticketing platform, a great outcome for the customer and for the team who bested large telecom providers to win the deal. They also deepened their relationship with the customer and delivered more than $3 million in licensing and services revenues.\nThe second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve the outcomes they need is the recent adoption of Focal Point Academy by a major technology company. Focal Point Academy is a bespoke training program that delivers workforce development programs that solve today's greatest cybersecurity problems, finding, training and retaining skilled cyber professionals.\nFocal Point Academy's operationally focused portfolio, which covers high-demand topics like threat hunting and application security, coupled with its ability to train and develop both senior and junior technical professionals was exactly what the customer needed to achieve its desired outcome of mitigating risk. Prior to our acquisition of Focal Point, we would not have been able to deliver this important global solution and further deepen our relationship with the customer.\nInvestments in our customer and coworker-centric growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that leads to our expectations for the rest of the year. During the balance of 2022, we will continue to execute against our strategy to deepen our services and solutions capabilities. We are making excellent integration progress with Sirius, and that will remain a key focus area for the balance of 2022 as will investments in our coworkers and our own digital transformation.\nWe will continue to balance investments with our growth and profitability expectations, which are now higher than previously shared at year-end. Given our excellent momentum coming into the second quarter and first quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than our view at year-end 2021. Our view of U.S. IT market growth has also increased, and we now look for 2022 growth of 4%, which is 50 basis points above our prior view.\nTaken together, this equates to constant currency growth of 7.25% to 8.25%, above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall, 2021 combined CDW is calculated as those Sirius had been acquired on January 1, 2021, instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1.\nOn a reported basis, our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results. This outlook reflects our baseline expectations that given 2021 second half strong hardware performance we will mix into more cloud and security in the back half of this year. It also reflects our expectation that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year.\nAs always, we remain mindful of our wildcards, the potential for further disruptions to the supply chain, changes in COVID or macroeconomic performance and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential issues. As we always do, we will provide an update on our view on our next call.\nIn the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, which is leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we remain our customers' trusted partner who delivers the outcomes they need, whether for innovation, cost management, agility, risk mitigation or user experience. If the past 2 years have shown us anything, it is that our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever.\nLet me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2022 outlook.\nTurning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.9 billion, up 23% on a reported and average daily sales basis in constant currency. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.4% versus the fourth quarter, which is well above historical average sequential decline of 5%, this reflected 2 primary factors, first, demand for return to work, and remote enablement solutions remain strong and drove sequential growth in our commercial channels and international.\nAs Chris mentioned, corporate and small business had broad-based and balanced growth across both transactions and solutions. Second, Q1 reported results reflected 3 months of contribution from Sirius versus 1 month in Q4, notwithstanding that Sirius' first quarter has historically been the lowest quarter of absolute sales and gross profit dollars for the business. On the supply side, our overall backlog increased in Q1 at a similar level to the fourth quarter and remain elevated year-over-year in both transactional and solution categories.\nWe continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this constrained supply environment, and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantage to ensure strong returns on working capital. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 38.8%. Netted down revenues grew faster than the underlying business and represented nearly 31% of total gross profit, more than 3 points over the last year.\nThe higher mix of net service contract revenue, primarily within Software as a Service, favorable product mix and rate, and increased net sales and margin on professional services combined to deliver a record gross margin of 18.6%, up 220 basis points versus last year.\nTurning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $642 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll as a result of increased coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 14,005, up over 3,800 from prior year quarter, reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.\nRecall that Sirius' payroll as a percentage of net sales is higher than our core operations given their higher mix of solutions and services revenues, and this ratio is historically highest in the first quarter due to sales seasonality. The higher level of SG&A also reflects continued investments in the training and development of coworkers. Our return-to-office efforts and investment in our own digital transformation and technology strategy. As Chris mentioned, we will continue to balance investment with our growth and profitability expectations. Investments in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. GAAP operating income was $387 million, up 19.6%. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million, up 25.7% and non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.8%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from Q4.\nMoving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $56 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 11 was 24.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $80 million. Together, non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7%, up 50 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily driven by higher state taxes as well as taxes on foreign earnings.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 137 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.83. Our non-GAAP net income was $302 million in the quarter, up 21%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20, up 27% from last year.\nTurning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $387 million, and net debt was $6.2 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately of $1.4 billion.\nMoving to Slide 15. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 20 days, down 2 days from last year's first quarter and reflecting the impact of the Sirius acquisition.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $466 million, as shown on Slide 16. This is higher than a typical first quarter, reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives of paying dividends and paying down debt, including 62 -- $67 million of dividends and $260 million in debt repayments.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings.\nSecond, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the quarter at 3.1x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong cash generation and progress towards returning to our targeted net leverage ratio. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.\nWhile we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases until net leverage is in our target range, we are on a path to delivering on these priorities.\nMoving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 18. Starting with sales. As Chris mentioned, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We have excellent momentum entering Q2, we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look further out. Recall that on a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. With that in mind, our updated outlook for the full year 2022 is now U.S. IT market growth of 4% plus 325 to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency.\nOur baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range and we mix more in the netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experience elevated levels of supply constraints. With that, the higher end of the hardware growth is stronger and supply improves. Our outlook also assumes neutral currency impact for the full year.\nMoving down to P&L. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. For non-GAAP earnings per share, recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to a reported $7.97 per share, which included only 1 month of Sirius. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be approximately 13%, plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency and on a combined basis. This equates to low 20% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis.\nSlide 19 provides additional modeling thoughts, including our updated net sales split for the year. We now expect the first half of the year to be approximately 25 basis points above the high end of our historic norm of 48% to 49%. This reflects our overperformance in the first quarter and strong momentum coming into Q2. It also reflects that it's too early to update our expectations for the second half of the year.\nWe continue to expect the back half of the year will reflect a greater mix in the netted down revenues as we overlap 2021 strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins, all else equal.\nOur expectations for the first half split assume a low single-digit sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis. This equates to close to 20% year-over-year reported net sales growth in the second quarter, which is roughly 230 basis points above our Q2 implied growth rate expectations from last quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with the second quarter reported sales.\nFinally, as you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter. But over the continuum, we continue to expect to be within our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you."

Leahy\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CDW Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin our call with an overview of our full year and fourth quarter performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2022. Then I'll hand the call over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.\n2021 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. The teams delivered a $21 billion in net sales with excellent profitability. Margins improved, and our 13% increase in sales translated to a 17% increase in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases amplified this growth, and non-GAAP net income per share increased 21% to $7.97.\nThese exceptional results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model, a model that has enabled us to deliver industry-leading performance year after year, including through the past 2 years of a global health crisis, unprecedented supply interruptions and evolving customer priorities. You see the power of our model and the performance across our balanced portfolio of customer end markets over the past 2 years.\nAs you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: Corporate; Small Business; Healthcare; Government, which includes federal and state and local customers; and Education with K-12 and Higher Ed. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own right. Often, different factors impact customer end markets, sometimes macro and sometimes, industry specific. This was the case over the past 2 years as customers across our diverse end markets experienced the impact of the pandemic very differently.\nIn 2020, public customer spend, fueled by education and government, offset commercial and international declines, and net sales increased 2%. In 2021, our 13% sales increase was powered by strong commercial and international customer spend, which more than offset flat public sales. The past 2 years also highlighted the power of our business model in our product and solutions performance. With more than 100,000 products and solutions from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands, we are well-positioned to meet our customers' needs, whether transactional or highly complex.\nIn 2020, customers prioritize remote enablement and continuity. Transactions increased driven by the ability to deliver endpoint solutions to meet unprecedented work-from-home and learn-from-home needs. At the same time, solutions declined as customers focused their spend on addressing critical endpoint projects. In 2021, while work-from-home and learn-from-home enablement remained key priorities, customers reprioritized investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure, platforms and endpoints. Both transactions and solutions increased.\nOur ability to help customers address their priorities during 2 years of unprecedented supply challenge is another example of the power of our business model. We leveraged our competitive advantages: our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the environment. And our sellers and technical coworkers helped customers find alternative solutions from our deep portfolio whenever possible.\nIn 2020, we were able to deliver more than 11 million client devices despite meaningful supply shortages in endpoint devices. In 2021, while facing extended lead times for transactions and solutions, we delivered solid growth in both categories. As you can see, our resilient business model had a significant impact on our ability to profitably grow during an unprecedented period. Looking at performance over the past 2 years. Net sales are up 15% since 2019, and our annual net sales compound growth rate was 7.5%. Profitability improved at a faster rate with compound annual growth rates for gross profit and non-GAAP operating income of 8% and 10%, respectively.\nOf course, our business model is not the only component of our formula to profitably outgrow the U.S. market. Our success would not be possible without the dedication of our talented team of 14,000 coworkers, including the more than 2,600 new Sirius coworkers, who joined us in December. During the past 2 years, time and again, CDW coworkers demonstrated why they are so vital to our ability to successfully deliver industry-leading performance year after year.\nLet's take a closer look at what the teams delivered for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $5.5 billion, including $197 million of results from Sirius, which closed on December 1. On an average daily sales and constant currency basis, net sales increased 9.6%. Non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year. The teams leveraged the combination of our broad and deep portfolio, extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes to address customers' priorities across all of our customer end markets, outcomes that deliver 5 key organizational benefits: innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers.\nLet's take a look. Corporate delivered a 33% increase with excellent performance across both transactions and solutions. Digital transformation, agility and security remain top priorities. Endpoint solutions remained a key focus area, and the team delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in client devices.\nSmall Business delivered another exceptional quarter, up 31% with strong growth across both transactions and solutions. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement. Security performance was up mid-teens as the team helped customers address risk mitigation needs, delivering penetration testing and Internet response as well as backup and recovery solutions.\nOn the public side of the business, excellent performance in both Healthcare and Higher Ed was not enough to offset expected declines in Government and K-12. And total public net sales declined 13%. Healthcare's 20% increase continue to reflect return to projects that have been put on hold. Security remained a top priority. Cloud adoption was strong, in part, driven by efficiency needs as customers dealt with COVID-19 and acute care. The expected decline in federal reflected the lumpy nature of government contracts as the team faced 2 meaningful overlaps in the fourth quarter of 2020, the wind-down of our Device-as-a-Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and a large client device program. Results also reflected the impact of slowness in contracting practices we shared last quarter.\nWe are beginning to see green shoots, and there is no change to our expectation that trends will reverse later in 2022. State and local posted a high single-digit decline. The team delivered a high single-digit increase in solutions, driven by helping customers upgrade security. This could not overcome the team's 2020 strong fourth quarter performance when they help customers take advantage of the year-end use-it-or-lose-it care funds.\nAs we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers work through the planning required to evaluate multiple funding opportunities and multiyear phasing and expect funded projects to begin implementation as we move through 2022. Higher Ed's strong double-digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12. And overall, Education sales increased 9% on top of 2020's fourth quarter remarkable 142% growth. Higher Ed growth reflected our ability to meet growing demand for student success programs. These programs use technology to give institutions an edge, including comprehensive endpoint solutions, improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhancing the dorm room experience.\nThe K-12 team delivered excellent net sales performance against very tough unseasonal fourth quarter '22 compares. Consistent with expectations we've previously shared, net sales declined. Although down year-over-year, fourth quarter client device sales were more than double a typical pre-COVID fourth quarter. Both the U.K. and Canada delivered high-teens local market growth. Combined in our other results, average daily sales for these 2 markets increased 20% in U.S. dollars. Customer priorities in both markets were similar to those in the U.S.\nOur success addressing customer priorities is evident in our fourth quarter portfolio performance, where we delivered balanced growth across transactions and solutions, both increasing mid-single digits. On the transaction side, client devices increased mid-single digits. While client device supply improved in some areas and we were able to help more customers adopt alternative providers, overall supply remained constrained. And we exited the year with an elevated backlog.\nTight supply continued to impact prices, which our teams were generally able to pass along. Video and audio delivered another impressive quarter. Solutions growth was driven by strong software and servers performance. Writings remain strong as customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and entire life cycle. Lead times extended in several key solutions areas, notably NetComm, enterprise storage and servers. Remaining solutions orders increased at year-end.\nOnce again, the team delivered strong double-digit growth in cloud, driven by robust growth in security, Infrastructure as a Service and productivity. Security cloud growth was driven by the success of our comprehensive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation with many solutions delivered via cloud and software. Overall, security spend in the quarter increased mid-teens.\nOur ability to meet customer needs in the quarter across the IT continuum translated into a mid-single-digit U.S. hardware sales 20%-digit increase in software and more than 50% increase in services. Services growth reflected the ongoing success of our strategy and was balanced across professional and managed services. Recent acquisitions are paying off, contributing meaningfully to this quarter's growth.\nSo as you can see, our fourth quarter delivered a strong finish to an excellent year of financial performance. 2021 was also a year of excellent strategic progress against our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, extend our services capabilities.\nIn 2021, we made excellent progress against all 3 of these pillars. Acquisitions made during the year, Focal Point, Amplified IT and Sirius as well as integration progress for our 2020 acquisitions of IGNW and Aptris, furthered our strategy to bolster our services capabilities. Deep services capabilities are critical to our ability to deliver full organizational outcomes across the full stack in the entire life cycle. This is an important source of differentiation in the marketplace.\nLet me share a quick example of how this is showing up in our performance. Our acquisition of Amplified IT in August deepened our already strong offering in the Education space, particularly in the Google ecosystem, which is the largest education platform in the U.S. Amplified IT's expertise as a systems integrator enables us to facilitate end-to-end solutions for education customers. This leads to greater customer engagement and stickiness and provides insights into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IT life cycle.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the CDW Amplified for Education team worked closely with Google and Internet2] teams to make it easier for institutions to adopt Google Workspace for Education Plus. In addition to ease of procurement, with the Amplified IT team on board, we were able to deliver additional value to customers through a much-needed deep technical expertise and services, expertise and services that deliver organizational outcomes, enhance collaboration, streamline instruction and a secure learning environment.\nThis joint campaign generated more than 30 net new awards in the fourth quarter with more than $11 million in total contract value over the next several years. This is a great example of how we leverage our powerful business model to quickly deliver customer benefits from newly acquired capabilities. It is also a great example of how our acquisitions enhance our ability to deliver full outcomes across the full stack in the entire IT life cycle.\nInternal investments made in 2021 also enhanced our ability to deliver on this strategy. These included digital investments in proprietary portals to drive customer and seller productivity. We also added 1,000 new coworkers in addition to the nearly 3,000 coworkers who joined us via acquisition. Just over half of all new coworkers in 2021 are in technical roles.\nWhether acquired or homegrown, investments in our 3-part growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. That brings me to our thoughts about 2022. In 2022, we will continue to execute against our 3-part strategy with a focus on the recent integrations. A top priority in this area is the disciplined integration of Sirius. Work is moving at pace, led by a dedicated seasoned executive.\nThe team's mission is just as it's been with all of our acquisitions, to ensure our customers are able to quickly reap the benefits of our combination. And we are making excellent and swift progress in that area. For example, I'm pleased to share that our new Sirius coworkers had a CDW e-mail address on Day 1, a seemingly small accomplishment, but with really big impact.\nTurning to 2022 financial performance. Our outlook is built off a combined 2021 CDW and Sirius net sales figure of $23 billion, which includes $2.2 billion of full year Sirius results. Top line performance for Sirius was relatively flat compared to 2020 as they overcame a number of large projects and the impact of supply interruptions. Managed services, an area of focus for Sirius, delivered double-digit growth.\nIn 2022, as Sirius is integrated into the fabric of CDW, we expect its operations to grow in line with total CDW. Given current market dynamics, our 2022 baseline outlook calls for U.S. IT market growth of 3.5%, plus 200 to 300 basis points in constant currency of CDW outperformance. This outlook reflects our view on 3 key drivers. First, we expect a moderation in U.S. GDP growth. Second, we expect the impact of supply on our results in 2022 to remain fairly consistent with its impact at year-end 2021. And third, we expect customer priorities in 2022 will increasingly require integrated solutions that leverage our services, cloud and hybrid expertise.\nWildcards remain ongoing supply and macro impacts, particularly in Small Business. Of course, as we always do, we will update you on our thoughts as we move through the year. I'm extremely proud of the excellent financial performance and strategic progress we've made during the past 2 years. In 2022, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute the competition.\nIf the pandemic has shown us anything, it is that technology is essential to all sectors of our economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. That means our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever, and I remain confident that we have the right strategy in place.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al?\n\nAlbert Joseph Miralles\n\nSenior VP & CFO, CDW Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail in the fourth quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook.\nTurning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.5 billion, including 1-month contribution from Sirius of $197 million. Consolidated net sales were up 11.7% on a reported basis and 9.9% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 extra selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales were 9.6%, including 3.9 points of contribution in Sirius.\nConsistent with the last quarter, net sales and channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year, Corporate, Small Business and International, continue to rebound, posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefit from strong double-digit performance in Healthcare but was tempered by the expected decline in Government and Education.\nOn the supply side, our overall backlog increased a few hundred million dollars in the quarter, reflecting constraints similar to last year. Backlog remained elevated year-over-year. We continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this constrained supply environment. And the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages so the backlog did not increase even more.\nGross profit for the quarter was 976 -- 10.8% on a reported basis and resulted in a strong\n(technical difficulty)\nGross margin was positively impacted by the increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily Software as a Service, in addition to strong professional services performance. This was more than offset by lower product margin and overlapping high-margin configurations in the prior year. Sirius' gross profit margin was consistent with their historical performance and was modestly accretive to the overall gross margin for the quarter.\nTurning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. This reflected the impact of consolidating 1 month of incremental Sirius expenses. Sirius' sales compensation as a percentage of net sales are higher than our core operations given the higher mix of solutions and services revenues. The overall increase also reflected higher performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against financial goals and investments in the business, including increased coworker count.\nWorker counts at the end of the quarter were 13,924, up 2,826 from the third quarter and 3,942 over prior year. The increase in coworker count during the quarter reflects the addition of over 12 -- $2,600 -- 2,600 Sirius coworkers and other organic and inorganic work investments to support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.\nGAAP operating income was $339 million, up 2.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $425 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. As we shared on last quarter's call, investments made in the fourth quarter drove an operating margin, which delivered our full year outlook. Sirius' non-GAAP operating margin was consistent with their historic performance and was marginally accretive for the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $43 million, up 16.9%. The increase reflected the incremental expense on the $2.5 billion of notes issued in December to finance the Sirius acquisition. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 25.1%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.5%, up 230 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to onetime tax benefits recognized in the prior year.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, the fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 138 million. GAAP net income per share was $1.57, down 4.5%. Our non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year and reflects the impact of share repurchases.\nTurning to full year results on Slides 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2021 performance reflected exceptional execution against an effective strategy, along with the power of our business model and balanced portfolio. Net sales were $20.8 billion, an increase of 12.7% on a reported basis and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full year consolidated net sales grew 11.9%, including 110 basis point contribution from Sirius. Gross profit was $3.6 billion, up 11.2%. And gross profit margin was 17.1%, down approximately 30 basis points year-over-year.\nIn 2021, software and services accounted for approximately 41% of gross -- total gross profit, up 100 basis points from last year. The increase reflects investment in our services and solution capabilities and a continued shift in the netted down revenues like Software as a Service. Before moving down the rest of the full year P&L, I want to take a moment to put netted down revenues into perspective. Netted down revenues results from Software as a Service, software [insurance] and warranty solutions as well as aging commission fees. We are not the primary obligor for these solutions and thus record gross profit as our revenue and why you sometimes hear us refer to these as 100% gross margin items.\nIn the past, we've shared examples of how this accounting treatment has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins, all else equal. Over the last 5 years, our netted down revenue streams as a percentage of total gross revenues or customer spend has increased 10 percentage points.\nThe greater mix reflects increased customer spend on fast-growing netted down revenue streams like cloud and security. Long term, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and invest in the capabilities necessary to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers, we expect to mix further in the high-growth netted down revenue streams.\nThis mix dynamics will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit and expanding gross margins. This, of course, is subject to hardware refresh cycles and other mix components of the business. While much of what I've described is tied in the accounting treatment, it is also a reflection of our success in the execution of our strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities and high-growth solutions and expand services. Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.4 billion. And non-GAAP operating income was $1.6 billion, up 17.1%. Net income was $989 million, and non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion, up 17.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $7.97, up 20.9%.\nTurning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. On December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $258 million, and net debt was $6.6 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion.\nMoving to Slide 21. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 24 days, up 7 days from last year's fourth quarter. In addition to our strategy of holding customer-driven stocking positions, the increase reflected mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles and the timing of customer receipts. This is partially offset by the timing of payments at the end of the year. Full year free cash flow is $477 million, as shown on Slide 22. This is lighter than last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing, onetime items and advantageous vendor payment terms. In 2021, our free cash flow was also impacted by increased working capital to support our strong full year growth.\nWe also leveraged our strong balance sheet and distribution capabilities to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers in this unprecedented supply environment. As a result, 2021 free cash flow was below our rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Timing differences, onetime items and noted investments resulted in asymmetrical free cash flows across 2020 and 2021. In aggregate, 2020 and 2021 free cash flow is balanced out and equated to 4.3% of net sales, slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb. In 2021, we delivered on our capital allocation objectives. We deployed more than $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $235 million of dividends and $1.5 billion of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $172 per share.\nTurning to 2022 capital allocation priorities on Slide 23. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target a dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings.\nSecond, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended this year at 3.4x above our range due to the financing of the Sirius acquisition. We intend to optimize the use of cash flow after paying dividends to focus on reducing debt until we return to our net leverage range. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases until net leverage is in our target range.\nMoving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 24. As Chris mentioned, our outlook is built off the combined 2021 CDW and Sirius results, which presents these numbers as if we owned Sirius at the start of 2021. Let me walk you through how this looks. Starting with sales. Given what we're seeing in the market now, our baseline outlook assumes U.S. market growth of 3.5%. We currently expect combined net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. On a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.9 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius.\nWe expect Sirius to grow in line with total CDW. Right now, 2022 feels like a normal demand environment and expect it will reflect a greater mix in the netted down revenues as we overlap strong client device sales. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect it to be at the lower end of our premium range if we mix more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experience elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end, if hardware growth is strong and supply improves. Currency is expected to be neutral for the full year, assuming an exchange rate of $1.37 to the British pound and $0.80 to Canadian dollar.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $8.49 in 2021 on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included 1 month of Sirius. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow high single digits in 2022, call it, 9.25%, plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 16% to 17% growth in constant currency on a reported basis. As Chris mentioned, the integration work with Sirius is progressing. And given the nature of the integrated sales, we will not be breaking out Sirius results going forward. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our combined financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis.\nSlide 24 provides our expected net sales split for the year. We expect net sales in the first half of the year in line with our historic norm of 48% to 49%. Sirius' sales split is slightly higher in the second half than historic CDW. Historically, we see a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. This year, on a reported basis, we expect first quarter sequential growth in the low single digits, reflecting 3 months of contribution from Sirius versus 1 month in Q4. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth, relative to Q1 2021, to be in the low mid-teens, reflecting seasonality and channel mix.\nModeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can also be found on Slide 25. In addition, you can see our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. We expect CapEx to run approximately 70 to 75 basis points as a percentage of net sales, reflecting our continued view that now is the time to continue to accelerate investment in our own digital transformation, enabling us to further fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners.\nThat concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions.

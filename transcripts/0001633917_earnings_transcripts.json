My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined by CEO, Alex Chriss; and Chief Financial and Operating Officer, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.\nOver to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. PayPal is a fundamentally stronger company today than it was 2 years ago. Focus and execution have enabled us to drive a positive inflection across our business. Take transaction margin dollar growth, excluding interest on customer balances. We are on pace for 6% to 7% growth in 2025 compared to negative growth just 2 years ago.\nRevenue growth has accelerated in the past 2 quarters as a result of our deliberate strategy to focus on profitable growth. Operationally, we are winning new customers and deepening engagement across our existing base. We have reinvigorated unprofitable and underperforming parts of the business. We're leveraging our incredible brands to innovate and expand our addressable market beyond online payments. Thanks to our omnichannel initiatives, we've accelerated branded experiences TPV growth to be between 7% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis over the past 4 quarters.\nOur BNPL business is sustaining 20% volume growth quarter after quarter. Venmo revenue growth has accelerated 10 points compared to 2 years ago, while we have also continued to grow our user base.\nOur enterprise payments business has turned a corner, returning to volume growth and consistently contributing to company transaction margin dollar growth. We have delivered this acceleration in our business while remixing inefficient spend into growth investments and returning capital to shareholders. And in total, we are on pace to deliver at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth this year. All of this gives us confidence in the business' longer-term growth potential and ability to deliver high single-digit transaction margin dollar growth and non-GAAP EPS growth in the teams or better over the longer term.\nI'm also excited to announce that we are initiating a dividend. Our overall capital allocation priorities remain the same. We will continue investing first and foremost in our business' growth and transformation. We see this dividend as strengthening our overall capital return program, working in conjunction with our ongoing share buybacks.\nOur free cash flow generation and balance sheet are strong, and give us ample room to both deploy capital to drive growth and return capital in a disciplined way to shareholders. Put simply, this is the new PayPal, built for faster, more profitable growth. Our strong foundation, differentiated competitive advantages and clear strategic direction, position us to capture a massive and growing addressable market.\nWith building execution momentum, we are driving innovation at a remarkable pace and scale. This makes us exceptionally well placed to win into the future.\nTurning to our third quarter performance. We delivered at or above the high end of our guidance range for transaction margin dollars and EPS. Importantly, our TM dollar growth continues to come from multiple areas of the business, including branded experiences, PSP and Venmo. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 12%, reflecting the flow-through of our transaction margin performance. The strength of our 2-sided platform is evident in how customers are choosing to deepen their relationship with us. Monthly active accounts grew 2%.\nWhen you look at transactions per active account growing 5%, excluding PSP, you see the real story. Customers aren't just signing up, they're incorporating PayPal and Venmo into their daily lives. This engagement depth makes us a valuable partner to merchants and will drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow I'd like to discuss the progress we are making in our 4 strategic growth drivers: winning checkout, scaling omni and growing Venmo, driving PSP profitability and scaling our next-gen growth vectors.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, PayPal's TM dollar growth, excluding interest, has not only accelerated, it is coming from a far more balanced mix across our business. This is important to appreciate the strategy underpinning the value our teams are working to create. Compared to last year, win checkouts contribution increased and PSP, omni and Venmo's contributions or a multiple of what they were in the past. This is a direct result of the work we have done to build more holistic, healthier merchant relationships to scale our omnichannel presence and to monetize Venmo. The innovation and momentum across the company are increasingly visible as you have seen in our recent announcements and as you will hear today. I plan to move quickly so that we can look deep a few key areas like BNPL and Venmo, while also leaving ample time for Q&A.\nLet me start with branded experiences, which covers our first 2 growth drivers: online and in-store branded checkout. Our strategy is to meet our customers everywhere they shop, whether online, in-store or Agentic. We are focused on delivering the best checkout experience so consumers can pay how, where and when they want. It means they could pay online with PayPal, buy now, pay later, Venmo, crypto or soon a partner wallet through PayPal World. It means they can pay in-store with a PayPal or Venmo debit card, BNPL or tap to pay. And it means building for a future where consumers can pay through AI agents powered by Google, OpenAI, Perplexity and others.\nLast September, we launched PayPal Everywhere in the U.S. to move beyond our legacy in online branded checkout into an omnichannel world, a year-end and the results show our strategy is working. Branded experience's TPV grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. This includes PayPal; buy now, pay later; Venmo and our debit card programs and is the single most important metric to track the progress on transformation from an online payments company to a commerce company. We need to be available everywhere a consumer wants to make a purchase. But this is about more than being present across channels. It's fundamentally expanding what PayPal means to our customers and the total spending we can capture.\nHistorically, PayPal was synonymous with online retail payments. Today, we're evolving the way consumers pay for all of their commerce needs. Moving beyond retail into services, subscriptions, bills, everyday expenses and more. We are now playing for a much bigger addressable market. Our confidence in the financial impact of this strategy comes from the flywheel effects we see across our ecosystem. When customers start using PayPal or Venmo offline with our debit card, their online activity increases as well, ARPA goes up, profitability improves.\nIn Q3, our PayPal debit card actives transacted nearly 6x more and generated nearly 3x the ARPA of checkout-only accounts. We see a similar pattern with BNPL. Its use drives an uplift in overall activity and engagement. The data clearly validates our strategy and gives us confidence to increase our growth investments. Most of our product initiatives plus our marketing investments over the past year has started in the U.S. It's worth examining our U.S. proof points as they demonstrate the potential for our business as adoption scales internationally. For example, in the third quarter, we reached 10% Branded Experience's volume growth in the U.S., more than double our growth in the same quarter a year ago. That acceleration comes from 2 things: growing omnichannel adoption and sustained improvement in the U.S. online branded checkout trends, supported by our improved experiences.\nWe have the right set of drivers and initiatives in place. Now our focus is on adoption and investing to amplify our impact. As we move into 2026, we will be leaning more into these efforts and expanding across key international markets. Let me address online branded checkout in more detail. TPV grew 5% in the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis. That solid growth, especially with the choppy global macro trends we continue to see this quarter. Given the competitive intensity online, we know more work is needed to close the gap between our performance and overall e-commerce growth. Our strategy moving into next year centers on 3 priorities: continuing to scale our redesigned checkout experiences, improving how we are prioritized across merchants and importantly, driving biometric adoption.\nWe are also leaning into new verticals and geographies that expand our addressable market and avenues for growth. All of this will be complemented by a consumer value prop with a highly competitive rewards program aimed at increasing frequency and selection rate. We also have a powerful growth lever with buy now, pay later and Venmo, which I'll discuss further shortly.\nThis year, we've made significant progress deploying our redesigned paysheet experience, which now covers close to 25% of our global checkout transactions. We're moving quickly, but untangling a decade or more of legacy integrations is complex and taking more time than planned.\nIn the cohorts where we are now optimized in the U.S., we continue to see close to 1 point conversion improvement. This gives us confidence it's a win, not if we see more benefit from this modernization. At the same time, it's critical that we keep improving PayPal's prioritization across merchants and scaling biometric login, both of which have been proven to increase conversion.\nOn the prioritization side, we are focused on scaling upstream messaging on product pages, driving adoption of our payment-ready API that allows merchants to target high-converting PayPal users when they land on their site and improving PayPal's placement at checkout.\nImproved prioritization and presentment are powerful. In testing, when our buy-now pay-later options are presented upstream on a product page, we see a nearly 10% lift in branded checkout volume on average. That improvement drives incremental sales for our merchants and customer loyalty with repeat use for PayPal.\nWithin biometrics, we are focused on scaling biometric login, including pass keys and driving mobile app adoption, which enables seamless authentication during checkout. In ongoing testing to date, these authentication efforts when paired with the redesigned paysheet we've been scaling, have shown improved conversion between 2 to 5 percentage points. Consumers benefit from a mobile checkout experience that is second to none while merchants see a higher customer satisfaction and sales. It's a win for both sides of our network.\nThe bottom line, the initial results we have seen to date in the U.S. makes us confident we're on the right path and have the right initiatives in place, both to drive acceleration and increase growth investments as we move through next year.\nNow that I've covered some of the foundational work underway, let me dive deeper on 2 important growth levers that I mentioned, BNPL and Venmo. The shift towards buy now, pay later is a fundamental change in how consumers want to pay, and we are extremely well positioned to capture this shift. In the markets where we offer BNPL our solutions are available nearly everywhere PayPal is accepted. It's a reach and scale that's hard to replicate. This quarter, BNPL volume continued to grow more than 20%, with particular strength in the U.S. This puts us on track to process close to $40 billion in BNPL TPV in 2025. Monthly active accounts climbed 21% and our Net Promoter Score globally is 80. People love this product.\nWe have everything we need to win this market. We are investing to transform our BNPL business from a payment option that consumers discover in the PayPal wallet after they made a purchase decision into a customer acquisition channel. This means moving to the beginning of the shopping journey through marketing and upstream presentment so that consumers know they can increase their purchasing power with BNPL. This focus and investment will expand our right to win in BNPL and further accelerate growth.\nWe are also expanding BNPL to new geographies and introducing new product offerings, both online and in-store. We have successfully expanded BNPL into Canada and extended payment terms in Italy and Spain to up to 24 installments. After proving the model in Germany, we brought BNPL in-store to the U.S. through the PayPal mobile app seamlessly connecting online and off-line shopping. We are building the future of flexible payments, and we're doing it at scale.\nMoving to our Venmo business. Venmo isn't just another payment app. It's the money movement platform of choice for the next generation. One of the things that continues to set Venmo apart is its user base, young, affluent, digitally native consumers who are shaping the future of commerce. With nearly 100 million total active accounts growing mid-single digits, Venmo has tremendous scale in this attractive demographic.\nWe have a deliberate sequence strategy that's changing how these users engage with Venmo. At the core is maintaining our leadership as the best P2P platform in the market, attracting more funds into the Venmo ecosystem, driving omnichannel spending and seamlessly integrating commerce into the Venmo app. We are already seeing results.\nVenmo is at a clear inflection with TPV growing 14% in the third quarter, continuing to accelerate from 12% in Q2 and 9% in 2024. Pay with Venmo just hit a milestone, $1 billion of TPV in September alone, and Pay with Venmo monthly active accounts grew by nearly 25% in the quarter. We hit a new record with our Venmo debit card, which attracted 1 million first-time users in Q3, thanks in part to our college partnerships.\nMonthly Venmo debit actives grew by more than 40%. This has resulted in overall Venmo monthly active account growth accelerating to 7% year-over-year to nearly 66 million monthly active accounts.\nFrom a financial perspective, Venmo is on pace to generate $1.7 billion in revenue this year, excluding interest income. That's up more than 20% and a 10-point acceleration from 2 years ago.\nUnder the surface, we are also changing our revenue mix and growing in high-margin areas. Over the past 2 years, we've doubled Pay with Venmo and Venmo debit card revenue. Not only can Venmo become a more significant revenue driver as it scales, but it is also accretive to transaction margin. And here's what makes this so compelling. We're still in the early innings of monetization. Today, Venmo's average revenue per monthly active account sits at just over $25. While over 90% of Venmo's users engage with P2P, only 5% to 10% are using our debit card or Pay with Venmo, and less than 5% have set up recurring funds in. For the subset of accounts engaged across P2P, debit and Pay with Venmo, which is still small today, ARPA is about 4x higher.\nFor accounts that are also bringing funds in through direct deposit or instant ad, ARPA is 6x higher. In other words, the upside on Venmo's revenue is a multiple of where we stand today. The good news is that adoption is accelerating. For example, new users today are adopting our debit card and nearly 4x the rate they were 2 years ago, giving us massive runway as we continue driving attachment of these high-value products. This is one of the reasons why we are investing in our college partnerships and introducing unique, personalized rewards that drive multiproduct adoption and encourage balanced spending within the Venmo ecosystem.\nWe're also expanding Pay with Venmo into new high-value use cases like our built partnership for rent payments. At Investor Day, we discussed growing Venmo revenue to more than $2 billion by 2027 and it's clear that the team's execution will allow us to deliver well beyond this over time.\nTaken together, these businesses, online branded checkout, BNPL, Venmo and omni, drove branded experiences TPV growth of 8% on a currency-neutral basis.\nMoving to our PSP business. Our PSP volume growth accelerated to 6% from 2% last quarter, demonstrating that we are accelerating growth after re-baselining. This growth is profitable and contributed to transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. We are doing this by continuing to build holistic relationships with merchants. Value-added services like payouts, adaptive payment optimization and FX as a Service, deliver real measurable value, including improvements to authorization rates and cost reduction. We're seeing merchants not only willing to pay for these capabilities, but actively requesting more of our services as they begin to recognize the benefits for their business.\nAs we continue to expand our unified enterprise payments platform globally, we are bringing these margin-accretive services to new merchants from day 1. We expect accelerated growth in this business as we expand the adoption of value-added services across our existing customer base, and launched with Verifone as our first omnichannel solution provider in Q4, strengthening our position in the PSP market.\nWhile we accelerate growth in branded experiences and PSP, we are also aggressively innovating in Agentic, ads, stablecoins and digital wallet interoperability through PayPal World to establish avenues for future growth. I'll highlight just a few of our recent developments.\nWe continue to partner with leaders across the Agentic space, including Perplexity earlier this year. And in September, we announced our expansive multiyear partnership with Google to create new AI shopping experiences. This morning, we announced a significant partnership with OpenAI to expand payments and commerce in ChatGPT, including adding PayPal branded checkout for shoppers and payment processing for merchants using Instant checkout. This is a big win for PayPal and our customers.\nToday, we also announced our own Agentic commerce services, which help merchants sell through multiple AI platforms, including Google, OpenAI and Perplexity. Merchants will have one integration to access consumers through multiple LOMs. Agentic Commerce will take time, but we do believe consumer behavior will shift. PayPal is building for that future.\nFinally, I'm very excited to share that PayPal World is officially in its pilot stage, and the first test transactions are happening this week. I'm proud of the progress that we've made this quarter from partnerships to new product innovations to continuing to strengthen our profitability.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jamie to go into the financials in more detail.\n\nJamie S. Miller\n\nChief Financial Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Alex. Moving to Slide 10. PayPal delivered another quarter with good execution and real momentum across the underlying business. TPV and revenue growth both accelerated by 2 points from the second quarter. Transaction margin dollars excluding interest grew 7%, continuing the momentum we built through the first half. The drivers of that growth have been broad-based, led by strong credit performance, branded checkout flow through, improvements in PSP profitability and Venmo monetization. Growth across these areas was partially offset by higher transaction losses in the quarter.\nThe diversification and quality of this growth is a meaningful improvement from where we were at the start of the company's transformation. We have clear opportunities to build on this progress with investments that strengthen our competitive position and drive durable profitable growth.\nMoving back to third quarter financials. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6%, strong operating income, share buyback and a favorable tax rate more than offset headwinds from lower interest rates, contributing to 12% growth in non-GAAP EPS.\nAdjusted free cash flow, which excludes the timing impact from the origination and sale of pay later receivables was $2.3 billion or $4.3 billion year-to-date.\nTurning to Slide 11. We are driving deeper, more active relationships with our customers. Monthly active account trends showed steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to $227 million. Transactions per active account, excluding PSP, which is a good proxy for engagement, accelerated to 5% growth.\nMoving to Slide 12. Total payment volume accelerated to 8% growth at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis to over $458 billion. We've moved branded experiences to the top of this slide to reflect the importance of this metric to our more expansive strategy and value creation. Looking across the product portfolio, we see encouraging signs that our initiatives are gaining traction and making an impact. Branded experiences TPV, which includes online checkout, PayPal and Venmo debit as well as tap to pay posted another quarter of 8% growth.\nAs Alex mentioned, U.S. branded experiences TPV growth accelerated to 10% in the quarter, benefiting from both omnichannel adoption and better trends in U.S. online branded checkout.\nWhile debit card and tap-to-pay spend represent a small portion of branded experiences volume today, they are growing rapidly, up 65% year-over-year, accelerating from last quarter. Venmo TPV growth accelerated 2 points to 14%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nOn an online-only branded checkout basis, volume grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. Compared to last quarter, there was less pressure on volumes from Asia-based marketplaces selling into the U.S. At the same time, this improvement was offset by pockets of softer consumer discretionary spending in Europe and the U.S. later in the quarter. Overall, we have seen relatively consistent growth in the number of checkout transactions, but basket sizes or average order value has decreased. While still early in a back-end loaded quarter, we've observed this trend continuing through October.\nWe remain focused on the initiatives we can control. We're confident in our branded checkout strategy and the road map that our teams are advancing. The early results in the U.S. demonstrate that we're on the right path with our initiatives, including our redesigned experiences; buy now, pay later and Pay with Venmo. We're laser focused on execution across the 3 key areas Alex discussed: scaling our redesigned experiences, improving prioritization and driving biometric adoption. All of this is increasingly complemented by a compelling consumer value prop that differentiates PayPal and Venmo is one of the best, most rewarding ways to pay.\nWhile this work is complex and takes time, we fully expect to see our efforts build as we move through the next year and scale these initiatives. Pay with Venmo and buy now, pay later continue to outpace the market, taking share from other payment methods, growing 40% and 20%, respectively. These results give us the confidence to begin making targeted investments in the fourth quarter that amplify the impact of these and other initiatives throughout the portfolio.\nTurning to PSP, which spans both enterprise and SMB processing as well as parts of our VaaS portfolio like payouts in [Audio Gap] Fed services revenue grew 15% to $895 million driven by another quarter of strong performance in consumer and merchant credit.\nWe've also been encouraged by growth in customer balances and the impact of our initiatives designed to encourage customers to bring more funds into the ecosystem. While lower interest rates are still a headwind, a portion of this impact has been offset by higher balances.\nWe continue to be pleased with the quality, diversification and performance of our credit portfolio. In September, we took another step forward in line with our balance sheet light model for credit, externalizing a portion of our short-term U.S. pay later receivables with Blue Owl Capital. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in net loan receivables, down 8% sequentially. Transaction take rate declined by 3 basis points to 1.64%, driven largely by product and merchant mix as well as the impact of foreign exchange hedges. This decline was an improvement relative to last quarter and included less impact from foreign exchange hedges and enterprise processing.\nOnline branded checkout take rates continue to be relatively stable year-over-year, reflecting our transaction and merchant mix as well as our focus on profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, TM dollars ex interest grew 7%. TM dollar growth included a 1.5 point headwind from higher volume-based expenses, largely transaction loss provisions resulting from the temporary service disruption in August, which primarily impacted Germany. There was also a slight benefit less than 1 point from the Blue Own pay later externalization I referenced earlier.\nSetting aside the impact of loss provisions related to the August service disruption, we've seen an improvement in transaction loss rates relative to last quarter. Non-transaction-related OpEx increased 6% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6% in the quarter to nearly $1.6 billion.\nMoving to capital allocation. As you saw in our materials and heard from Alex, I'm excited to share that we are initiating a dividend as part of a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet give us ample room to both deploy capital for growth and return capital to shareholders. In general, we continue to target about 70% to 80% of our free cash flow for capital return with the vast majority going to buyback.\nThe dividend serves as a complement to our existing buyback plans and will be calculated based on a 10% payout ratio relative to net income. This quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 4 quarters to $5.7 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $14.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $11.4 billion in debt.\nMoving to guidance on Slide 14. Following another quarter of strong financial performance, we are raising our full year guidance for TM dollars and non-GAAP EPS. For the fourth quarter, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We expect fourth quarter TM to be between $4.02 billion and $4.12 billion, which represents about 3.5% growth at the midpoint. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect TM dollars to grow by about 5% at the midpoint compared to 7% year-to-date. Setting interest rates aside, there are a few factors to highlight that impact our fourth quarter outlook. First, we have seen strong credit outperformance over the past year, driven by good execution from the team as well as a more benign loss environment. We expect to see year-over-year comparisons start to normalize more in the fourth quarter.\nSecond, given the performance of some of our key initiatives, we see an opportunity to lean into our competitive differentiation with additional investment to drive faster growth over time. In the fourth quarter, we will begin increasing investments designed to drive product attachment and habituation. Some of these investments are linked to volumes and, therefore, recorded as contra revenue impacting TM dollars and designed to drive additional growth over time.\nOther growth investments such as global brand awareness campaigns, typically sit within marketing and nontransaction OpEx. Lastly, on TM, our fourth quarter guide assumes some deceleration in branded checkout growth relative to our third quarter average.\nFrom a volume perspective, the most important weeks and months of the quarter still lay ahead. That said, we are planning prudently given the recent spending trends and the uncertain macro backdrop. We are also cognizant of lapping strong consumer spending in the fourth quarter of last year.\nMoving to OpEx, we are planning for low single-digit nontransaction OpEx in the quarter and expect about 3% growth for the full year. We expect to deliver fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to $1.31, up 7% to 10%. For the full year, we are raising our TM dollar guidance by $100 million at the low end and $50 million at the high end to a range of $15.45 million to $15.55 billion, which represents 5% to 6% growth. Excluding interest, we expect TM dollars to grow between 6% to 7%.\nWe are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.35 to $5.39, growing at 15% to 16%. Our guidance continues to project approximately $6 billion in share buyback and full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion, which excludes the timing impact of the origination and sale of pay later receivables.\nI'd like to wrap up by thanking the PayPal team for their hard work and execution this quarter. We are making tangible progress across the business and the foundation we're building positions us well for continued growth ahead.\nWith that, back to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Jamie. We are operating from a position of strength. The results you're seeing are proof that our strategy is working. We built a more balanced, profitable growth engine across branded experiences, PSP and Venmo and that's exactly what we set out to do. We're investing in high-impact growth initiatives that will move the needle and future-proofing the business with critical partnership, while simultaneously returning value to shareholders through our buyback program and our newly launched dividend. We have moved this business from defense to offense from stabilization to acceleration. We know exactly where the opportunities are, and we are laser-focused on executing our strategy.\nWith that, Steve, let's go to Q&A.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n[Operator Instructions] Sarah, please open the line.",

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Regina. Welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined by CEO Alex Chriss, and Chief Financial and Operating Officer Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Over to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nThank you, Steve. We had a strong quarter delivering profitable growth and building momentum in transforming PayPal from a payments company into a dynamic commerce platform. Fintech is in its infancy, and we believe the next five years are likely to see more change in how people shop than the last two decades combined. As the largest two-sided open platform in the world, we have the unique advantage of connecting hundreds of millions of consumers and merchants of every size to unlock entirely new, deeply personalized shopping experiences. With PayPal's unmatched scale and trusted brands, our strategy is laser-focused on anticipating and fulfilling what customers need today, and what they'll expect tomorrow, whether they're buying online, in-store, or through AI agents. Our execution is fast and focused. We are strengthening PayPal's value proposition to bring in new customers, increase engagement, and create strong partnerships with merchants.\nWe are also attracting top brands and developers as we innovate and shape the future of commerce. The traction we are seeing across our initiatives continues to give us confidence that PayPal's growth will accelerate in line with our three-year outlook. Turning to our second quarter performance, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of profitable growth despite the macro uncertainty. Transaction margin dollars grew 8%, excluding interest on customer balances. Success across many of our strategic initiatives contributed to that growth, including online and offline branded experiences, payment services, and Venmo. This highlights a healthy business with multiple avenues to sustain and accelerate growth, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18% year-over-year. We continue to build upon our broad reach and strong engagement. Both total active accounts and monthly active accounts grew 2% in the quarter.\nTransactions per active account, ex-PSP, grew 4% as more people use PayPal and Venmo more often. If we look at our four strategic growth drivers: winning checkout, scaling omni, growing Venmo, driving PSP profitability, and scaling our next-gen growth vectors, we are making meaningful and tangible progress on all four. I'd like to walk through each one, highlighting examples of our progress. The first two growth drivers are entirely focused on improving and growing our branded experiences. I'm proud that we drove 8% currency-neutral growth in branded experiences TPV this quarter. This positive result reflects the benefit of meeting our customers wherever they choose to shop with PayPal and Venmo, online and offline. As a reminder, branded experiences include winning checkout, expanding buy now, pay later, winning with Venmo, and scaling omnichannel capabilities.\nStarting with online branded checkout, TPV, including PayPal, BNPL, and Pay with Venmo, grew 5% currency-neutral in the second quarter, consistent with what we've been seeing over the past year. Our upgraded experiences are driving the uplift we expected, and most of our merchants and consumers are behaving consistently with recent quarters. At the same time, we offset headwinds from platforms and merchants in Asia, where we saw volumes decelerate following the implementation of tariffs. Our focus is on the things that are within our control and that we know will have a positive impact on our overall growth trajectory over time. That starts with driving more traffic through our upgraded checkout experiences, both in the US and internationally. These upgrades offer a much better consumer experience, improved presentment of BNPL, and drive meaningful conversion rate improvements.\nThis is currently rolling out in the US, Germany, and the UK, and we have a comprehensive playbook that we will apply to other countries. Around mid-teens percent of our global transactions are now on our latest experience, including more than 60% of our US checkout transactions. We are also investing in key use cases like subscriptions to drive repeat branded checkout use. Many of these efforts that are contributing to growth this year will continue to ramp into next year and add to our confidence that we are on track to achieve our growth outlook for branded checkout TPV. Turning to buy now, pay later, BNPL continues to deliver strong growth quarter after quarter. In the second quarter, BNPL volume grew more than 20%, and monthly active accounts climbed 18%. When consumers choose BNPL, their average order value is more than 80% higher than a standard branded checkout transaction.\nWhy are we winning customers in BNPL? Put simply, scale, ease of use, and customer value. Our BNPL solutions are available nearly everywhere PayPal is accepted in our largest markets. That makes us the most broadly distributed BNPL solution in the market. Merchants can offer flexible payment options that drive higher sales, all seamlessly integrated within the PayPal ecosystem, no extra tech work, and often at a lower cost than with standalone BNPL providers. Merchants unlock the real power of our BNPL solutions when they add awareness messaging upstream on their product pages. Merchants choose to feature PayPal BNPL upstream because we offer a trusted, name-brand option that is already bundled with our comprehensive suite of branded payment options. Ace Hardware is a great example.\nAfter adopting this upstream messaging and offering a 0% APR promotion, they saw a 35% year-over-year increase in total PayPal sales and a seven-fold increase in average order values. Today, we offer BNPL in nine global markets. We will continue to expand to more markets throughout the year, and launch additional marketing to boost awareness and adoption. Next, Venmo. When I joined nearly two years ago, the big question was, can you grow Venmo? Today, the answer is a resounding yes, and you're starting to see it in our results. Venmo delivered another outstanding quarter, showcasing some of our best growth in years. In Q2, we grew Venmo revenue by more than 20%, marking our highest revenue growth rate since 2023. TPV grew 12%, accelerating quarter over quarter to the highest growth rate in three years.\nThis momentum stems from deliberate product innovations over the past year and dynamic marketing campaigns that are repositioning Venmo from a peer-to-peer payment tool to an everyday commerce platform. The result is that our Venmo user base is not just growing, it's engaging in commerce with Venmo. Our recently announced Big 12 and Big 10 college distribution deals will fuel this further. Not only will college athletes be able to receive institutional revenue share payments through PayPal or Venmo, the Venmo brand will be embedded in some of the most iconic matchups in college sports. We've released new co-branded Venmo debit cards, and Venmo will also be working with the Big 12 and Big 10 to enable acceptance for campus spending, including at bookstores, for ticketing, concessions, and merchandise, giving students more flexibility to shop and pay with the app they already use every day.\nThese deals leverage our strong reach with the college-age demographic to put Venmo everywhere across college campuses. Pay with Venmo TPV was up more than 45% in the quarter, and we achieved an approximately 25% increase in Pay with Venmo monthly active accounts as our merchant network continues to broaden. Leading brands that resonate with Venmo's valuable demographic, like Sephora, KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, are adding Pay with Venmo in their apps, making it easier than ever for users to spend their Venmo balance wherever they shop. On the omnifront, Venmo Debit Card monthly active accounts were up more than 40% as a result of our newly redesigned and simplified onboarding. This is a great business, and Venmo's potential is significant. Our team is fully focused on unlocking even greater growth ahead. Turning to our omnichannel strategy, we are seeing strong momentum.\nDebit card TPV across PayPal and Venmo grew more than 60%, while monthly active accounts grew more than 65%. Adoption is strong and accelerating, with another approximately 2 million first-time PayPal and Venmo debit card users in the quarter in the US. In Q2, we launched a new physical card for PayPal Credit, our digital credit line product. This new card is an extension of the existing PayPal Credit product, allowing users to access their credit line both online and, for the first time, in physical stores. The card also provides access to promotional financing offers, including six months of interest-free financing on travel purchases. This new card is in addition to our PayPal Cashback Mastercard, which offers 3% back on all purchases through online branded checkout.\nOur strategy focuses on getting our card products into the hands of even more of our customers, aiming to grow our share of wallet through options that can power every payment our customers make. This, on its own, is a massive opportunity for PayPal and an area where we can drive penetration much, much higher. That is before the flywheel benefit for branded checkout. Our data underscores the benefits of this approach. Customers who adopt one of our card products transact more frequently, choose PayPal more often when shopping online, and deliver higher average revenue per account. Following the strong momentum from our US launch last year, we took PayPal Everywhere to Germany in June with groundbreaking innovations. We launched the first-ever PayPal contactless mobile NFC wallet on iOS and Android, introduced flexible pay later to go for BNPL offline, and delivered in-app cashback offers at over 2,000 stores.\nTo amplify the launch, Will Ferrell teamed up with us again for our largest marketing campaign yet in Germany. We already have more than 3 million NFC enrollments, and are seeing impressive engagement trends. It's very exciting to see this kind of traction so early, and we are on track to expand to the UK this year. The outcome of all this progress and momentum is that we drove 8% currency-neutral growth in branded experiences TPV this quarter, and we have confidence that we can continue to grow this moving forward. Each pillar of our branded experiences is a thriving business on its own, and, combined, they position us for sustainable, long-term growth and success. Finally, I'd like to explain how last week's announcement of PayPal World will be a game changer for our branded experiences.\nDigital wallets have become ubiquitous, and the standard for making a payment or sending money worldwide. Today, almost 3.5 billion people rely on digital wallets as their go-to method for shopping and transferring funds. That's 83% of global digital payments happening through wallets, and the number is only going to continue growing. There will be over 5 billion wallets globally by 2026. Among those billions of users, there are hundreds of regional wallets represented. This fragmented system of wallets poses tremendous challenges and immense friction in a global commerce ecosystem. For consumers, it means you are never quite sure if and where your wallet will be accepted. Even for wallets like PayPal, with tremendous global reach, there are large regions of the world and millions of merchants that are closed off.\nFor many users with regional wallets, traveling out of the country poses new challenges with spotty or no acceptance and the need to create and keep track of multiple wallets just to interact with the world. While P2P payments should be easy, the need for a common wallet between users often makes it impossible to send money to friends or family around the world. For businesses, it means building the technology to accept dozens of wallets, which adds unnecessary costs and creates a fractured experience full of friction for customers, ultimately limiting reach and, of course, sales. When you want to sell to the world, how do you choose which wallets to accept and which customers to turn away? You shouldn't have to make that choice. This is where PayPal World comes in, to make it simple and easy to connect any consumer with any merchant.\nFive of the largest digital wallets in the world, PayPal, Venmo, Mercado Pago, Tenpay Global, and UPI, are coming together on a seamless global platform, so you can now use your preferred wallet anywhere in the world. For our PayPal merchants, PayPal World will mean access to billions of new customers through their existing branded checkout integration. Now, a UPI user in India who wants to buy a pair of sneakers from an online store in Germany that accepts PayPal can simply click the PayPal button at checkout, and their familiar UPI button will be presented for them to complete the transaction. It's that simple. This means our connections for branded checkout will extend beyond our 400 million customers to more than 2 billion consumers worldwide, and that will continue to grow.\nWhether you're sending money to a friend or relative across borders or traveling to a country with a different currency, you will be able to transact seamlessly. PayPal World is purpose-built for the future of commerce too. The platform will be compatible with dynamic payment buttons, stablecoins, and the latest technologies and commerce experiences, including agentic shopping. PayPal World is expected to go live beginning in the fall, with partner wallets connecting to PayPal and Venmo. Over time, PayPal World aims to connect billions of users at scale, and we expect this to expand as we add more partners in the coming months and years. Even since our announcement last week, we've received multiple inbound requests from wallets across the globe looking to join the PayPal World platform.\nMoving to our PSP business, I want to reflect on one of my first earnings calls where we shared our plan to reset our largest merchant relationships to price our services to the value we deliver. The consequence of that reset was pressure on growth in exchange for long-term profitability. Now we are on the other side of that and can confidently say that our strategy worked. We maintained our customers, we are having more strategic conversations and relationships with them, and most importantly, we are now growing our Braintree TPV again and expect an acceleration in the back half of the year. This is an important inflection point, and I am really proud of the team for their execution. Key to this strategy has been investing in and scaling our strong suite of value-added services.\nThese services are helping position PayPal as a trusted, innovative partner in this evolving commerce landscape and have transformed the margin profile of our PSP business. Let me share one example. Payouts is one of the value-added services that is growing rapidly. Some of the world's top travel, mobility, and social commerce platforms already use Hyperwallet to manage and distribute funds to hosts, drivers, and creators globally. Most recently, our payouts capabilities were a strategic enabler in our landmark partnerships with the Big 12 and Big 10 college athletic conferences that I mentioned earlier. Hyperwallet enables the conferences to provide student athletes with rapid access to revenue share payments that can be sent directly to their PayPal or Venmo accounts, where they can then spend and send the money instantly. For small businesses, our priority remains empowering merchants with the tools they need to manage and accelerate their growth.\nWe're steadily migrating more transactions onto PayPal Complete Payments. PBCP enables SMBs to easily access our latest online branded checkout, and new products like Fastlane. As of today, over half of SMB volume flows through this platform, a notable improvement since last quarter. Our recent expansion of PBCP into Singapore further extends our global reach. We also continue to deepen our relationships with the most popular platforms where SMBs manage and grow their businesses. Just last week, we announced an expanded partnership with Wix that gives merchants access to our full suite of payment tools, and seamlessly integrates into Wix payments to fuel sales growth. When our small business customers succeed, the relationship with PayPal deepens, and we remain committed to expanding access to the tools and capital that fuel that growth. Let's turn to how we're shaping the future of commerce by innovating in agentic, ads, and stablecoins.\nIn each of these areas, we are creating new ways to fuel growth in the years ahead. Agentic AI is rapidly changing the commerce landscape, and PayPal is at the forefront. We were an early mover, launching the first remote MCP servers for commerce earlier this year. Now we're helping merchants and developers meet the moment as consumers begin to purchase goods and services through AI agents. As you've seen through our announcements over the last few months, the major players in AI, including Perplexity, Anthropic, and Salesforce, are working with PayPal to create powerful new agentic commerce experiences. These new experiences will enable customers to find the right products, check out directly within the AI client, track purchases, and much more.\nWe have differentiated KYC and KYB expertise, access to the largest ecosystem of payment-ready wallets with PayPal World, and will continue to build our capabilities in this nascent space so that we strengthen our position as the go-to partner for agentic commerce. We have the brand trust, data, and expansive customer base to make this vision a reality. Moving to ads, we continue to make strides with new products that create more personalized shopping experiences by allowing merchants to reach the right customers more effectively. We launched off-site ads in Q2, enabling brands to reach millions of consumers across the open web through display and video ads, all powered by PayPal's data insights. Building on this, we introduced storefront ads, a new ad format that allows consumers to browse, shop, and pay directly within the ad unit.\nWhat makes storefront ads truly differentiated is our ability to combine seamless in-ad checkout with direct merchant integration and PayPal's trusted payment capabilities. Following our US launch, we've begun expanding internationally, with PayPal ads now live in Germany and the UK, and we continue to scale our advertising business globally. Turning to crypto, I want to highlight our stablecoin, PYUSD, which is a pivotal part of our mission to advance global commerce by directly addressing pain points our customers face today, namely the burdens of high fees and the slow speed of cross-border money transfers. Traditional payment methods can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, creating friction that stifles growth and opportunity in global trade. PYUSD delivers a stable, reliable, and cost-effective alternative to conventional systems. We can enable businesses and individuals to transact with greater confidence and agility, fueling economic activity on a global scale.\nWe are laser-focused on solving real-world problems for our customers and sequencing our efforts, starting with cross-border transactions. With the strength of PayPal's commerce network, PYUSD is well-positioned for mainstream consumer and merchant use cases. This quarter, we added the ability to earn rewards for our stablecoin on PayPal and Venmo, and announced the expanded availability of PYUSD on Stellar and Arbitrum blockchains. We are collaborating across the ecosystem to expand PYUSD's prominence as a commerce-first stablecoin with a network of exchanges, custodians, and other payments partners, including Coinbase, Fiserv, and MasterCard. As I mentioned earlier, PYUSD will also be a major enabler of the PayPal World platform. Yesterday, we announced Pay with Crypto, powered by PayPal, which will enable instant crypto-to-stablecoin or fiat conversion.\nIt will support transactions across more than 100 cryptocurrencies and wallets, such as Coinbase and MetaMask, and tap into a global base of more than 650 million crypto users. We're only at the beginning of what's possible here. I'm excited to see us continue to solve critical customer issues related to cost, speed, stability, and seamless payment integration. A big part of the future of commerce will be on-chain, and PYUSD will help power that journey. As you can tell, our pace of innovation has accelerated significantly. This is in large part due to our efforts to consolidate our platforms, strengthen our infrastructure, and leverage AI across the company. To wrap up, there is tangible momentum across the business. We are growing transaction margin dollars at a high single-digit rate, and we continue to see impressive growth across PayPal, Venmo, and our PSP business.\nAt the same time, we're making big and bold bets for our customers in AI, ads, and crypto. I'm proud of our team for leading the industry forward. With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Alex. Moving to slide 10, PayPal delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Transaction margin dollars grew 8%, excluding interest on customer balances. This was a continuation of last quarter's momentum and a meaningful improvement compared to the past three years. I'll walk through the key drivers and a few puts and takes momentarily. While we are pleased with our progress, what's even more exciting is the foundation we are building to sustain and accelerate this growth in the years ahead. TM dollars growth had multiple sources in the quarter, including strong credit performance, branded checkout flow-through, improvements in PSP profitability, and Venmo.\nWe drove operating leverage through a combination of top-line growth and cost discipline, as we remixed less productive spend into product, tech, and marketing. Taken together, non-GAAP operating income grew 13%. Share buyback and a favorable tax rate more than offset headwinds from lower interest rates, contributing to 18% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes the net timing impact between originating and selling European buy now pay later receivables, was $656 million. Adjusted free cash flow was negatively impacted by timing shifts in working capital, which we expect to reverse in the second half of the year. We continue to expect full-year free cash flow of $6 to 7 billion. Turning to slide 11, account and engagement trends are healthy. Active accounts and transactions per account, excluding PSP, both continue to grow. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the first quarter to 438 million.\nMonthly active accounts also continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 226 million. Transactions per active account, excluding PSP processing, grew 4%. Moving to slide 12, total payment volume grew 6% at spot and 5% on a currency-neutral basis to nearly $444 billion. Looking across the product portfolio, there are a few key areas I'd like to highlight. As Alex noted, we are driving faster growth at Venmo. Venmo TPV increased 12%, its highest rate of growth in three years. In addition to driving more awareness and usage of commerce capabilities, we have been focused on improving core product and user experiences, which contributed to a P2P acceleration in the quarter. Branded experiences TPV, which includes online checkout, PayPal, and Venmo debit, as well as tap-to-pay, posted another quarter of 8% growth.\nWhile debit and tap-to-pay spend represent a smaller amount of volume in branded experiences today, they are growing rapidly and are up more than 60% year-over-year. Winning checkout remains our most critical priority. Our teams are laser-focused on advancing the many initiatives that reinforce our checkout business. In the second quarter, online branded checkout volumes grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This was relatively consistent with the growth we delivered over the past few years. At the same time, the macro and consumer spending environment has been uneven. As we moved through the quarter, we observed a slight softening in retail spending in the US, most apparent in areas likely impacted by tariffs, such as Asia-based marketplaces with higher exposure to goods sourced from China. We continue to make progress modernizing and improving the performance of our checkout experiences, and scaling more seamless authentication like passkeys and biometrics.\nWe are also increasingly giving consumers more reasons to choose PayPal, for example, with enhanced rewards and incentive programs. Pay with Venmo and buy now pay later continue to outpace the market, taking share from other payment methods. Our efforts to drive branded experience adoption with our debit cards online and in-store, including tap-to-pay, help to fuel our checkout business by increasing brand habituation, leading to incremental branded checkout volume. We are confident in the steps we are taking to drive higher conversion, selection rate, and engagement, and are now beginning to take these enhancements outside of the US. While still early in our progress, we see clear signs that our initiatives are making a positive impact. Bending the growth curve takes time for a company of our scale, but we remain confident that the actions we are taking today position us well to accelerate over time.\nTurning to PSP, which spans both large enterprise and SMB processing, as well as parts of our vast portfolio like payouts, invoicing, and point-of-sale solutions, volume grew 2% in line with the first quarter. Our focus on prioritizing healthy, quality growth within our Braintree business continues to deliver meaningful TM dollars improvement. We've also hit a positive inflection point for Braintree volume. We are now past the peak pressure from renegotiating and shedding unprofitable volume. Braintree volume was roughly flat in the quarter. We expect a return to volume growth in the third quarter as we drive profitable front-book business, support our existing merchant base, and continue to lean more into value-added services. Moving to more financial detail on slide 13, transaction revenue accelerated to 4% growth on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $7.4 billion.\nExcluding Braintree, transaction revenue grew 7% on a currency-neutral basis, accelerating from 4% in the first quarter. Other value-added services revenue grew 16% to $847 million, driven primarily by strong performance in consumer and merchant credit. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in net loan receivables, up 7% sequentially, and we continue to be pleased with the quality, diversification, and performance of our credit portfolio. Most of this growth came from our Buy Now Pay Later and international consumer revolve portfolios, where we have seen improvement in charge-offs and low, stable delinquency rates. We are focused on targeting a balance sheet-light model for credit, and we are making progress towards externalizing another part of our portfolio later this year. Transaction take-rate declined by four basis points to 1.68%, driven largely by the impact of foreign exchange hedges, product, and merchant mix.\nThis decline was an improvement relative to last quarter and included slightly less impact from Braintree and payouts. Online branded checkout take rates were more stable year-over-year, reflecting our mix of transactions, merchants, and a continued focus on profitable growth. This focus, and the progress we are making across our strategic growth drivers, continues to be most clearly demonstrated by the acceleration in the TM dollars growth we have delivered over the past year. As I mentioned earlier, TM dollars ex-interest grew 8%. Growth came from multiple sources, including credit, branded checkout, PSP, value-added services, and Venmo. TM dollars also benefited from a roughly one-and-a-half-point one-time contribution from the renewal and expansion of our relationship with a key payment partner. This benefit was more than offset by an increase in transaction losses in the quarter.\nHigher transaction losses were a combination of normalization in loss rates following last year's strong performance and new product introductions. Non-transaction-related OpEx increased 2% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. Compared to our guidance, OpEx benefited from the timing of certain G&A items, and the shift of some marketing spend into the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating income grew 13% in the quarter to more than $1.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin increased about 130 basis points to nearly 20%. You'll also see in our materials that we reported restructuring costs of approximately $92 million. These costs are related to workforce actions, and the key tech transformation initiatives that we discussed at our investor day.\nOn the tech side, this includes the start of a three-year plan to re-engineer infrastructure, streamline operations, and exit certain data centers as we unify platforms and migrate more to cloud-based solutions. We're excited about the increased speed, flexibility, data utilization, and scalability that these efforts will deliver over time. Moving to capital allocation, in the quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past four quarters to $6 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $13.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and $11.5 billion in debt. Moving to guidance on slide 14 for the third quarter and full year 2025, following a strong first half, we are on pace to outperform our original expectations for the year. We are raising our full year guidance for both TM dollars and non-GAAP EPS.\nSimilar to last quarter, we have embedded a range of potential outcomes into the second half of the year. The low end of our full year guide could absorb up to a couple of points of deceleration in e-commerce spending should that occur. Overall, consumer spending and the labor market have proven resilient, but we continue to closely watch how tariffs and other trading friction might impact global economic activity, spending, and supply chains over time. For the third quarter, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth at the lower end of mid-single digits, or approximately 4% or so. We expect continued momentum in transaction revenue, with lower growth in other value-added services revenue compared to the second quarter. This includes the impact of interest rate headwinds, and a more difficult prior year comparison for credit growth.\nWe expect third quarter TM dollars to be between $3.76 and $3.82 billion, which represents 4% growth at the midpoint. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect TM dollars to increase by approximately 6% at the midpoint. We are planning for up to high single-digit non-transaction OpEx growth in the quarter. This higher growth reflects continued investment in tech and new product launches, as well as the shift in timing of some marketing spend that I referenced earlier. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.18 to 1.22, or roughly in line with the prior year at the midpoint. For the full year, we now expect TM dollars to be between $15.35 and $15.5 billion, which represents 5% to 6 growth. Excluding interest on customer balances, we now expect transaction margin dollars to grow between 6% and 7%.\nWe expect to deliver full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.15 to 5.30, up 11% to 14%. Our guidance continues to project approximately $6 billion in share buyback and full year free cash flow of approximately $6 to 7 billion. I'd like to wrap up by thanking the PayPal team for their continued focus and dedication. The progress we're making gives us a strong foundation to build on as we execute on the second year of PayPal's transformation. With that, back to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Jamie. We had a great second quarter and are confident that our strategy is working as our momentum builds. We are executing on everything we said we would do 12 to 18 months ago. We are building out and improving our branded experiences, and giving consumers many more reasons to choose PayPal and Venmo. We are capitalizing on untapped opportunities in PSP and SMB. At the same time, we are actively shaping the future of commerce through our work in AI, ads, and crypto. Our velocity of innovation is only accelerating. I am more excited than ever about the future we're building. Steve, let's go to Q&A.\n\nSteven Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Regina, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question, and great to see your strategic plan really gaining momentum this quarter. I wanted to ask about branded online checkout TPV, which decelerated just a bit quarter over quarter to remain pretty stable for a few quarters. It sounds like tariffs are offsetting some of your own efforts like modern checkout and Will Ferrell to accelerate branded online TPV growth. How meaningful was the tariff headwind on branded online checkout TPV in Q2? In July, are you seeing a stable tariff-related headwind there, or is that a metric on that same metric, or could we see the headwind change and potentially intensify?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nHey, Ramsey. Thank you for the question and appreciate the comments on branded checkout. Look, we're excited as well. I think our execution on the global rollout, the US rollout is exactly what we were looking for. Really, the cohorts that we now have live in market are delivering exactly the way we expected. To the comment on these platforms from Asia, the way we think about it is without that pressure, our branded checkout really would have been at 6%. It is a small amount, but we've started to see it stabilize a little bit as we get into this month. Jamie, anything you'd add?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah, no, I would just say that our trends underlying all this really have been broadly consistent. There are puts and takes in any given quarter. Like Alex said, we did see a slight deceleration really in those Chinese to US corridors. In July, I would say it's still early, but seeing a bit less pressure in that space. We plan the full year with branded checkout at mid-single digits. We are on track for that.The watch-out that I really am looking at is we still have a fair amount of policy and macro uncertainty. We're obviously monitoring that, but we're very focused on our execution around our strategic initiatives. Bending the curve takes time. We expect to accelerate as we move through the next couple of quarters and next couple of years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Coverage Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, thanks a lot. I'm going to go. I wanted to ask about all the initiatives, Alex, that you went through up front. There's a lot going on, a lot to study. Specifically, I want to ask on Pay with Crypto and PayPal World. Because we've been thinking about this, I can make the case that both are TAM expanding, but potentially at a lower take rate. We've been getting a lot of these questions on both sides. How do you see it? Are you confident that both will be revenue and profit accretive as you push towards, I think you call it interoperability quite a bit in some of the releases? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thanks, Tien-Tsin. We're very excited. Hopefully, you're seeing the pace of our innovation just continue to accelerate. You're starting to see our whole strategy and the system that we're building together really play out. Let me take each of those. PayPal World, I think the easiest way to think about it in the short term is, A, what I'm really excited about is the interoperability between PayPal and Venmo. Now you've got a huge amount of Venmo customers that can click on the PayPal branded checkout and make their purchase online.\nWe've opened it up to almost 2 billion additional users, and that will just continue to grow. The best way to think about it is that's branded checkout. The way that we've orchestrated the agreements on PayPal World as a platform is the merchants maintain their branded checkout economics. If you're a user, I've gotten a lot of really fun notes in from LinkedIn UPI users that are now thrilled to be able to click on the PayPal button anywhere in the world and be able to make a checkout. For us, that's just expansion of TAM at the existing economics that we have. On top of that, you've got P2P economics and all sorts of other things that will play out over time. That's on PayPal World. It really is an expansion of the TAM.\nOn pay with crypto, we really do see this as, again, expansion of TAM at pretty attractive economics. The expenses come down significantly with crypto. This is still early days in consumers really using crypto to pay, but we want to make sure that our merchants are enabled and have the ability to take the payment when they need to. If you look at the net take rate on pay with crypto, it's actually quite attractive. We'll see how it ramps up over time from a volume perspective. Again, to your question, both are expansion of TAM for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about a topic that's becoming more important to investors, which is the promises of prominent placement of the branded checkout button in your merchant negotiations. When sitting down with merchants and renegotiating contracts, whether it's Braintree or PayPal or other, you're looking at the relationship holistically across products, the take rates or pricing, the use of BNPL, and the list goes on. Maybe most importantly, there's that potential contractual agreement or kind of a promise of a prominent placement of the branded checkout button. I was hoping you could give a little bit more context on how those conversations work and how things may or may not be changing on that particular aspect of the renegotiations. Thanks a lot.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, Tim, thanks for the question. Let me paint the picture. What's exciting is when we sit down with these merchants, and I'll sit down with the CEO as an example, we're really working merchant back about what's most important to them. A lot of the time, it starts with their ability to get access to more customers. Obviously, conversion matters. How do they find the right customer? How do they make sure that they're bringing the right customer to their site? Now we have a full suite of offerings. It can go from ads to some of our commerce APIs to drive personalization. It really runs the gamut. The conversations start with, hey, what are you trying to solve? We've got obviously unbranded. We've got Buy Now Pay Later. We've got branded opportunities in PayPal, in Venmo. What demographic do you want?\nWhat are some of the value-added services that you want? We really run the end-to-end spectrum. I think a couple of things that I would highlight that are exciting and sort of changing when it comes to branded in particular. First, because we are really pushing on buy now, pay later right now, we're pushing on our new branded experiences that brings everything together, we really can be that one-stop shop for a merchant to be able to have one button, a very powerful button that brings them the right demographic, and the right services for their customers. The second that I'd highlight is we're really changing the game from what has occurred in the past, which is with our payment-ready API, we're now able to really identify who that customer is upfront.\nInstead of having to negotiate, hey, we need present men at this number of buttons or this type of thing in certain areas, what we're really spending time talking about is, hey, accept our API, ping our API first, and we're going to tell you exactly what this customer wants. That is driving increase in conversion, increase in merchant adoption, because we really get to personalize the experience for the customer. I think we're leaning into the future. I'm really excited about not having to create sort of the 15 different buttons on a checkout, but just being able to give a merchant the ability to ping our payment API and serve the consumer exactly what they want to be able to increase conversion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys. Can we touch on how the European rollout of the modern checkout initiatives are coming along now? What's the timeline on it? When do you anticipate seeing measurable results? Just overall, looking at branded, maybe a little more color on international growth versus US, and revisiting whether you still expect to exit the year at an accelerated rate for branded versus the beginning of the year. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thanks, Darrin. Again, just to highlight, we were very deliberate in our strategy to start our rollout of our new branded experiences in the US. We're up over 60% now in the US, and the cohorts that we've rolled out are continuing to operate in the way that we wanted and showing the uplift that we expected, that we've talked about in the past.\nWe've now started to roll that out in the UK and Germany. As I've mentioned previously, those integrations typically are on newer integrations throughout Europe. I actually think we're going to continue to accelerate our adoption over the coming quarters across Europe. Very, very excited there. We're mid-teens overall on global TPV, and we want to see that continue to increase over the next few quarters.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah, I can jump in here and talk about non-US growth, which I think, Darrin, is where you were taking the second part of this. If you look at outside the US, again, we're really seeing largely consistent trends here. We continue to take share in Europe, including Germany. As Alex mentioned, our broad push around our latest innovation, it's not just the latest experience, but it is buy now, pay later.\nIt is the new app, app upgrades, and the experience around that. It's NFC, which we had a really successful rollout in the second quarter in Germany around that. It's all around branded checkout, really driving the habituation and the resulting halo that comes with that. The teams are really focused on scaling that and pushing that as they go through. With respect to accelerated rate, what I would tell you is that we are laser-focused on branded checkout. I think as we talk about all of this, that focus on execution, the focus on the strategic initiatives, we fully expect to see an accelerated rate of growth over the next few quarters and the next few years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Fawcett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for all the details here today. I wanted to touch on your efforts to expand the brands to offline and some of the initiatives that you have, including debit expansion of BNPL and credit. How should we think about that roadmap on a go-forward basis? It seems like you're driving really good engagement, just wondering about expansion into other geographies, and then product expansion beyond. It seems like there's an opportunity to become kind of a full suite of financial services that you're pursuing, but I'd just like to get the mileposts we should be tracking on those initiatives. Thanks a lot.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thank you, James. I think you're hitting on what we've really been laying out in our strategy when it comes to branded experiences. The best way to think about it is we just want to meet our customers where they are. The more they think about it, they are not delineating between online, offline, agentic commerce. They just think about buying. The way they see product placement, the way they're buying potentially online and picking up in store, customers are just choosing commerce the way they want to choose it. PayPal aims to be that choice for them wherever they want to buy. You've seen us obviously continue to accelerate our branded checkout experiences we just talked about online, but really leaning into that omnichannel strategy. In less than a year, I'm really proud of the team. We're at 5 million new PayPal debit card users since our launch, TPV growth for PayPal debit card up 75% in Q2 with really good economics.\nThat creates the habituated flywheel where for those debit card users, we see 6x transaction activity, 3x increase in average revenue per account for these debit card users. You look at the strategy that we just rolled out in Germany. Again, as a reminder, this is our first real end-to-end wallet that includes not just obviously online checkout, but NFC tap-to-pay, a reward system, buy now, pay later built into offline purchasing, and really seeing exciting growth there. There have been 3 million NFC enrollments since launch with engaged users that are transacting 16x per month. That is showing that we can resonate in an online, in an offline world, and really enable customers to use us for every purchase, every time, everywhere. That is the strategy. I think you're going to see us continue to roll that out globally.\nWe've said next up is the UK, we have great brand prominence across Europe, and believe we can take this platform across the rest of our market. Continue to see that rollout. Again, it's a full system of online, offline, BNPL, and all of this coming together.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning. I want to follow up on PayPal World and got an announcement. Now, historically, we have seen challenges with regards to user experience, awareness, different priorities when it comes to interoperability across wallets. I know in the past, it was kind of hard to create interoperability between PayPal and Venmo. So Alex, I think my question to you is, what could be different this time as you try and scale this across PayPal and Venmo, and also international payment systems? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks, Harshita. I think we've created a platform that really simplifies the user experience and have created a framework for all of the different wallets to be able to come together. Let me just talk about what we're in control of, obviously, which is that PayPal experience. For an online checkout, whether it's a Venmo user, whether it's a UPI user, whether it's a Mercado Pago user, or a WeChat user, you will be able to go to any PayPal button that you see on any merchant anywhere in the world, click that button, and be able to check out with your native wallet. We want no integration required by the merchant. The merchant already has PayPal integrated. They are accepted into the PayPal World ecosystem and now have access to billions of consumers. No change from the consumer.\nThey just have to click on the PayPal button, and they'll see if we can identify them through their phone number. We'll actually, at some point, change the button to be their home button so they can see it. If not, we'll be able to have them using some of the technology that we've already been building, things like Fastlane, things like being able to identify users upfront, be able to auto-create that experience so that it looks like a home experience for that native wallet. I think we've really focused, and this was a big conversation that I had personally with the CEOs of these other wallets, is this has to feel native. This has to feel like it's a common experience. There will be go-to-market commitments from all the different wallets to train users and show them that the PayPal World experience is right for them.\nThis is going to be frictionless. If you look at the offline experience as well, which we probably don't spend enough time thinking about, it's going to be the same thing. If you take a Venmo wallet or a PayPal wallet and you travel to India or you travel to China and you see a QR code, a UPI QR code from a local merchant in India, you can actually pull out your Venmo wallet, scan the local QR code, and make a purchase. We want it to be that frictionless. You're not adding new modules in your app, you're not doing anything different, you're just scanning QR codes and being able to purchase with your home wallet, and the currency conversion works. We are committed to making this as frictionless as possible for the merchant and the consumer.\nThat's why we worked so hard to bring these wallets together. I'll just say, just to wrap up, I am really excited about the partnerships and the conversations we've had with these wallets. There's a reason there isn't an interoperable network of wallets in the world. It's hard. We've had CEO-to-CEO conversations and a commitment across the different wallets to ensure that we're going to solve for a single platform for the world that enables consumers to be able to really have a delightful experience. More to come on this, but obviously a heck of a good start, and lots of momentum building.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nSenior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning. Alex, Jamie, I appreciate the comments on a couple of points of e-com deceleration factored into the low end of guidance. I guess as we dig into the key drivers of growth and transaction margin dollar growth in the second half, can we unpack that a little bit? How much visibility do you have into the new initiatives and sort of the specific growth drivers? Just maybe a quick related question on transaction losses, which ticked up. Is this the new run rate? How should we think about that on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nGood morning, Sanjay. Excuse me. With respect to transaction margin, what we're really seeing this year, and I would say our durable, consistent drivers between branded checkout, TSP, and VAS, Venmo, and credit. We saw credit as a strong driver in the first half. When you get into the second half, those drivers really continue very consistently. There is a couple of dynamics I would maybe call out.\nOne is that in the second half, we expect about a two-point interest rate headwind in third quarter and in fourth quarter, about $125 million. Just as you get into the second half, we had rate cuts in the last half of last year. We're expecting a couple of rate cuts in the second half of this year. We expect a decel, which will impact transaction margin dollars. The other thing is we expect slightly less contribution from credit just with tougher comps in the second half of last year. That is the TM dollars piece of it. The other part, oh, TL. With respect to transaction loss, yeah, we saw an uptick in transaction loss this quarter. It was about nine basis points. I'd say there's two things that are happening here.\nNumber one, and we talked about this, I think, when we have given our guidance at a couple of points earlier this year. Number one is normalization in transaction loss rates after what was a strong year last year. Second was, as we've been implementing and launching new products, we're just seeing a little bit of an uptick there, and things we have to work out and put more rules around and get those back into the flow. We expect the full year run rate to be about eight basis points, up from last year, but not as high as the second quarter. The other thing I would just mention is some of these other products that we've been launching and scaling just come with naturally higher loss rates, things like debit. All of this, it's an important area.\nWe continue to be very focused on optimizing through AI, through the team, and through automation. That's really how we're thinking about TL.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks, and good morning. Maybe just quickly, would be curious, any update on Fastlane in terms of the rollout and adoption there, and if you're able to measure any uplift in volumes from that so far? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thanks, Colin. Quick update on Fastlane. We continue to roll it out. Our focus is on the largest merchants, which, again, is excitement, and adoption is strong. It takes time for us to move through. They've not really invested in their guest checkout, but the improvement for these merchants is continuing to hold and be very strong. We're seeing conversion uplift at 50%, and consumers continuing to opt in.\nI think, again, I would highlight, as we continue to roll it out, 75% of users that are coming into Fastlane are really new or were dormant PayPal users that are now coming back in. The strategy is strong for us. The biggest next inflection will be as we roll out multiprocessor because many of our largest merchants really need Adyen, as an example, to be able to support Fastlane, which they've committed to do. That will come out in the next couple of quarters. This is a long game, and we're excited about the momentum, just continuing to move along.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nFinTech Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask on the news over the past few weeks with certain banks starting to charge for access to consumer data. Anything you can share on where within the business you rely on aggregators and with what you know today on the pricing that's been floated, just how you guys are thinking about the potential impact? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, Trevor, thank you. I'll keep this one simple. We're big supporters of open banking, and we've looked at this end-to-end throughout the business, and the changes are just immaterial to us. We're not going to be impacted by this really at all. Regina, let's make time for one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Dolev\n\nSenior FinTech Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in quickly. Can we talk about any benefits you're getting from the upgraded checkout experience? Obviously, there should be an uplift in the second half. Is there any way to quantify that? That would be great. Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, Dan, what I'd say is from the cohorts that we've rolled this out to, and remember, this is 15% of global TPV, we're continuing to see the uplift that we've talked about, call it a point of uplift. That is going to continue. We just need to roll this out to more. Our expectation is if you look at branded checkout overall, it's this new branded experiences, it's the momentum that we've got in buy now, pay later, which we're seeing over 20% year-over-year growth, it's the improvement in pay with Venmo, which we're seeing 45% year-over-year growth. All of those coming together, we continue to see momentum on. As we exit this year, I expect that we're going to start to see real improvement in branded checkout overall, and then as we move into 2026. This is a big shift.\nIt takes time to move. I'm excited about the momentum we have across all three of those elements, the new experiences, Buy Now Pay Later, and Pay with Venmo. I think we're going to start to see this thing turn as we get through the next few quarters and into 2026.\n\nSteven Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks. Alex, any final thoughts before we wrap?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nAgain, thank you for the questions today. I'm very proud of the quarter the team delivered. We did not get any questions on Venmo, and I want to highlight that we usually get a lot of questions on Venmo, and the team is just really killing it. There's something magical happening with Venmo right now, and I'm excited about where we're heading there as well. Overall, I appreciate the team's urgency and innovation. We're executing well, and excited to update you all along the way. Thank you, everyone. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

My name is Paulie, and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Paulie. Welcome to PayPal's first quarter earnings call. I'm joined by CEO Alex Chriss, and Chief Financial and Operating Officer Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now, over to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Steve. We had a strong first quarter as we began to execute on the strategy we laid out during our recent investor day. PayPal is transforming from a payments company to a commerce platform. This includes expanding to be available everywhere, whether it's online, in-store, or agentic. This means moving from a one-size-fits-all experience to personalized experiences that leverage the vast data at our fingertips. We are developing a dynamic smart wallet that will allow consumers to make the smartest choice in how to pay and get rewarded. With this transformation, we are shifting from being purely a payments processor to an end-to-end strategic commerce partner for our merchants. Underpinning this is our work to converge into a single PayPal platform that unlocks the full potential of PayPal's two-sided network in support of both consumers and merchants.\nThis strategy is durable and positions us to win in the months and years ahead. Turning to Q1, we have so much to be proud of. Let me share just a few highlights. Our strategy is designed to improve PayPal's profitability over time. In Q1, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth, with transaction margin dollars growing by 8%, excluding the impact from last year's leap day. That growth was driven by multiple sources across our strategic initiatives, including omnichannel commerce, both online branded checkout and offline branded payment methods, Venmo, and PSP. As a result of this focus on profitability, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year. Additionally, PayPal and Venmo are being used by more people, more often. Both total active accounts and monthly active accounts grew a healthy 2% in the quarter.\nTransactions per active account, XPSP, grew 4%, reflecting improved engagement and transaction growth in online branded checkout and Venmo. As we expand our offerings from online to everywhere, the best way to see the traction we're gaining is through branded experiences, TPV. Branded experiences comprises volume from PayPal and Venmo online checkout, as well as branded in-store payment methods like debit and tap-to-pay. In Q1, branded experiences, TPV, grew 8%, excluding last year's leap day. That's a full two points higher than branded experiences growth for the full year of 2024, highlighting the growing contribution of our omnichannel initiatives. It's still early days, but we are very proud of this progress. Within branded experiences, we're continuing to accelerate the rollout of our upgraded online branded checkout flows. This includes our simplified and modernized paysheet design, with streamlined login and reduced latency.\nSince the beginning of the year, we've driven a 25-point jump to more than 45% of US checkout traffic. This shows we can execute, and we anticipate an even faster rollout for Europe starting in the second quarter. Finally, Venmo had another standout quarter. We hit an important inflection point for Venmo monetization with 20% revenue growth, driven by our push to make Venmo one of the best ways to pay online and in-store. These are only a few examples of the strength we're seeing in the execution of our strategy. We're feeling the excitement of our innovations in the market, and the engagement from our consumers and merchant partners, and we're just getting started. As you can hear, I'm encouraged by the momentum we are driving.\nWe had a great start to the year and expect a solid second quarter, which would result in the first half coming in above our prior expectations. However, given it is early in the year and because of the current level of macro uncertainty, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year at this time. Jamie will provide more color on our results and guidance in her remarks. Let me now go into the details of the progress we're making on our strategic growth drivers. Starting with win checkout. Online branded checkout TPV, including PayPal and Pay with Venmo, grew nearly 6% this quarter, accounting for last year's leap day. We're proud of this growth and expect it to increase over time as more traffic flows through our upgraded experience.\nOne of the main benefits of our upgraded experience is the modernized paysheet, which improves the presentment of our full suite of payment options. This contributes to a personalized experience where consumers can more easily pay their own way, whether now with balance, cards, crypto, or buy now, pay later. What we're seeing is that as we improve the presentment of BNPL and checkout, it's being selected more often. In Q1, BNPL volume grew more than 20%, and monthly active accounts grew 18% year-over-year, highlighting the effectiveness of the new design and the strength of our value proposition. As a reminder, BNPL users spend 33% more on average, and conduct 17% more transactions. BNPL is featured in our latest marketing efforts with Will Ferrell about PayPal's flexible online checkout, and we are focused on winning in key markets.\nWe will continue to lean into BNPL throughout this year with targeted consumer awareness campaigns in the UK and Germany, and continued investment in other priority global markets, including Australia, France, Italy, and Spain. Pay with Venmo is resonating well with consumers and merchants, and it's growing rapidly with TPV increasing more than 50%. Monthly active accounts grew 30% as we increased merchant availability. For example, in January, JetBlue became the first airline to accept Venmo for bookings. We're seeing strong selection from Venmo's valuable demographic at major brands such as Domino's, Instacart, and TikTok Shop. I expect more demographic-relevant merchants to offer Pay with Venmo over the coming quarters. Let's move to the progress we are making to become omnichannel, serving our customers everywhere they want to shop with PayPal and Venmo. As I noted earlier, branded experiences TPV grew 8% in the quarter, excluding last year's leap day.\nThis growth reflects our strategy to deliver flexible and rewarding experiences that connect consumers to the things and experiences they want and love wherever they shop. Today, our PayPal and Venmo debit cards are enabling our customers to use their balance to shop anywhere cards are accepted. Adoption is strong and growing, with approximately 2 million first-time PayPal and Venmo debit card users in the quarter, an increase of nearly 90% from last year. Debit card TPV grew approximately 64% in the first quarter. Venmo debit card monthly active accounts grew nearly 40%, and penetration has increased to 6% of Venmo MAAs. We are focused on getting these products into the hands of even more of our customers because they allow them to choose PayPal and Venmo as their way to pay more often.\nIn the first quarter, users who adopted the PayPal Debit Card transacted nearly six times more and generated more than two times the average revenue per account compared to those who used online branded checkout only. There is also a halo effect where debit card users choose PayPal more often in online branded checkout. Our omnichannel strategy is showing early success in the US, and we are excited to replicate it internationally. We are on track to launch NFC capabilities in Germany later this quarter and bring PayPal everywhere to the UK in Q3. Moving to our PSP business, which remains a key driver of transaction margin dollar growth, we continue to build deeper relationships with the world's largest brands and sell our strong suite of value-added services. That is a massive, untapped, and margin-rich opportunity. I'll share two examples.\nWe recently scaled our optimized debit routing with Wayfair and Upwork. This service routes eligible debit cards through lower-cost debit networks, which helps merchants reduce their transaction fees. Regal Cinemas has adopted our fraud protection advanced service, which allows merchants to leverage PayPal's decades of fraud intelligence and advanced machine learning to improve their risk decisions and capture even more revenue. Let me give you an example of how this focus on adoption of value-added services can improve the end-to-end relationship and margin profile of our largest customers. Recently, we expanded our relationship with a longtime Braintree merchant. By focusing on price-to-value and processing, attachment of advanced risk capabilities, and leading-edge branded solutions like payment-ready API, we were able to improve merchant performance and profitability. We took this merchant from unprofitable to profitable, improving their transaction margin nearly 20 percentage points over the course of a year.\nThese are the kinds of conversations we're having that drive value for our customers and for PayPal. Because of the quality of our value-added services, we expect these types of improvements to continue over the next few years. For small businesses, we continue to migrate volume onto PayPal Complete Payments. Today, nearly half of SMB processing and checkout volume is on this platform, which is steady progress from last quarter. Bringing more SMBs into the stack enables them to easily access our latest online branded checkout, and new products like FastLane, and we've seen incremental product adoption increase by 33% as a result. Next, PayPal is leveraging our two-sided ecosystem in ways we've never before to innovate and build the future of commerce. Whether it's AI, personalization, ads, or crypto, we are providing our customers with the most advanced ways to engage in a shopping experience.\nThese initiatives are in the early stages, but unlock significant growth potential for us in the years ahead. Take AI, for instance. At Investor Day, I told you we were leaning into agentic commerce. I asked you to imagine what a future would look like where AI agents could bring up the right products at the right time, and complete your purchase. Thanks to rapid developments, that future is here. Just a few weeks ago, we launched the industry's first remote MCP server and enabled the leading AI agent frameworks to seamlessly integrate with PayPal APIs. Now, any business can create agentic experiences that allow customers to pay, track shipments, manage invoices, and more, all powered by PayPal, and all within an AI client. As we speak, developers are gathering at our San Jose headquarters for our annual Developer Days.\nEvery major player in AI is represented, providing demos and engaging with our developer community. The future of commerce will have a strong agentic presence, and we're excited about leading the charge. PayPal Ads is continuing to lay the foundation for a robust, highly differentiated ads business that will create more personalized shopping experiences. We're leveraging our extensive cross-merchant transaction data and customer insights to develop a platform that improves discovery for consumers and helps merchants reach more shoppers. We recently expanded PayPal Ads internationally with our launch in the UK. Today, we are launching off-site ads, which are ads informed by our insights placed outside of the PayPal platform. This will allow PayPal to help brands find the right user at the right time, and it is built with privacy in mind. We are working to rapidly accelerate advertiser onboarding as we continue to grow ads.\nCrypto is another area we're making strides. We're moving quickly to bring the benefits of crypto and stablecoins to our customers and the industry. Last week, we introduced the ability to earn rewards for holding PYUSD. This will increase the adoption and use of digital currencies for everyday commerce, from sending money internationally to making purchases and more. We've also strengthened our relationships with major crypto players like Coinbase, so people can more easily access and use PYUSD. As I close my remarks, I want to again highlight how proud I am of our team and the focused execution and innovation we are driving. To reinforce this point, let me bring together Venmo's strength in the first quarter as an example. We've leaned into Venmo, and the investment is starting to pay off. The Venmo user base continued to expand, and we're growing monthly active accounts mid-single digits.\nPay with Venmo TPV grew more than 50%, and MAAs grew 30%. Venmo debit card MAAs grew nearly 40%, and penetration has increased to 6% of Venmo MAAs. That's up from 4% a year ago. When you add it all up, the Venmo business grew revenue by 20%. That's sequential double-digit growth, and the highest rate we've achieved in years. Our execution muscle is growing stronger by the day, and we're just getting started. To recap, we had a great first quarter. We are confident in our ability to execute the strategy we laid out as we enter the year. With our clear strategy, strong balance sheet, high free cash flow conversion, and traction and execution, we have a solid foundation that allows us to navigate uncertain times and invest in our long-term growth. With that, over to Jamie.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Alex.\nMoving to slide five, PayPal delivered a strong quarter to start the year. Our results reflect another positive step forward, with multiple drivers contributing to an acceleration in profitable growth. We are improving our speed and focus across the organization, working hard to transform the company while improving our value proposition for consumers and merchants. Excluding interest on customer balances, transaction margin dollars grew 7%, or 8% ex-leap day, accelerating from last quarter. We outperformed the TM dollars and EPS guidance we provided in February, with upside driven by a combination of sources, including PSP profitability, Venmo, credit, and transaction expense improvement, and a more favorable tax rate. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 in the quarter, up 23%. PayPal generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter, bringing trailing 12-month free cash flow to $6 billion.\nAdjusted free cash flow, which excludes the net timing impact between originating and selling European buy now, pay later receivables, was $1.4 billion in the first quarter and $6.2 billion over the past 12 months. Turning to slide six, total active accounts increased by about 1.5 million from the fourth quarter and over 8 million versus the prior year's first quarter to 436 million. Monthly active accounts continue to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 224 million, with contributions from PayPal consumer accounts, and Venmo. Transactions per active account, excluding PSP processing, grew 4%. Moving to slide seven, total payment volume grew 3% at spot and 4% on a currency-neutral basis to $417 billion. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in February, this slide now includes a simpler and more relevant TPV breakout.\nThis view reflects how we think about our product portfolio today, the go-forward strategy, and our customer needs. Looking across these categories, we are encouraged to see signs that both consumers and merchants are expanding how and where they use PayPal. Winning checkout remains our most critical priority, and our teams remain laser-focused on advancing the many initiatives that reinforce our checkout business. In the first quarter, online branded checkout volumes grew more than 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding last year's leap day, which contributed over a point to growth, online branded checkout volumes increased nearly 6%. Branded experiences TPV, which includes online checkout, PayPal and Venmo debit, as well as tap-to-pay, grew 8% ex-leap day, accelerating from the prior year. We're excited about this momentum as we work to drive greater awareness that both PayPal and Venmo are ways to pay anytime and any place.\nUltimately, our goal is to form deeper consumer relationships, driving habituation across online and offline channels. Turning to PSP, which spans both large enterprise and SMB processing, as well as parts of our vast portfolio like payouts, invoicing, and point-of-sale solutions, volume grew 2% compared to 6% in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed throughout the past year, the shape of this growth is intentional. We are prioritizing healthy, quality growth within our Braintree business, and have made deliberate choices to shift away from unprofitable volume. Shifting away from this volume pressures gross revenue, but is accretive to transaction margin dollars and should result in more than one point of TM benefit this year. We continue to expect this benefit to build over time, as we drive more value-added services.\nMoving to more financial detail on slide eight, transaction revenue was flat on a spot basis or up 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $7 billion, driven primarily by branded checkout, Venmo, and SMB processing. This growth was offset by the shift away from unprofitable Braintree volume that I just mentioned. Importantly, other value-added services revenue grew 17% to $775 million, driven primarily by healthy performance in consumer and merchant credit. We ended the quarter with $6.5 billion in net loan receivables, up 1% sequentially, and we continue to be pleased with the quality, the diversification, and the performance of our credit portfolio. We take a prudent approach to managing the portfolio's exposure, and our goal is to sustain a balance sheet-like business model while providing our customers with more ways to manage their cash flow, spending, and borrowing needs.\nTransaction take rate declined by six basis points to 1.68%, driven largely by product and merchant mix. The two largest drivers of this change were momentum in payouts and shifting away from unprofitable volume on Braintree, some of which carries a higher gross take rate due to card funding. There was also impact from faster growth of large enterprise volume within branded checkout, adoption of the PayPal debit card, and growth of Venmo and PayPal P2P. These are positive trends for our business, demonstrating the relevance and importance of PayPal to consumers and merchants around the globe, as well as the progress we are making to improve profitability. Our focus on profitable growth, and the progress we are making across our strategic growth drivers, is most clearly demonstrated by the acceleration in transaction margin dollar growth that we have delivered over the past year.\nBranded checkout, PSP, and value-added services, credit, and Venmo were all meaningful contributors to transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. These drivers also include improvement in transaction expense. Transaction margin rate increased by more than 270 basis points year-over-year, reflecting our focus on price to value and profitable growth. Non-transaction-related OPEX increased 2% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. This includes marketing to support the rollout of new products and initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16% in the quarter to $1.6 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin increased about 260 basis points to 20.7%. In the quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past four quarters to $6 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $15.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and $12.6 billion in debt.\nMoving to guidance on slide nine for the second quarter and the full year of 2025, our teams are focused on execution and capturing the opportunity in front of us. We are confident that our scale, diversification, and balance sheet enable us to keep advancing our strategic growth drivers through different operating environments. As we continue making progress on PayPal's transformation, we have multiple growth levers and are well-positioned to help merchants and consumers navigate the environment. Importantly, with a strong first quarter behind us and a good start to the second, we believe we are on pace to outperform our original expectations for the first half of 2025. At the same time, given uncertainty in the environment and the potential for a wide range of outcomes, we are appropriately cautious.\nConsumer spending and the labor market have proven resilient, but it remains to be seen how tariffs and other trading friction will impact global economic activity, consumer spending, and supply chains over time. As Alex mentioned, despite our strong start to the year, we're maintaining our full year guidance, and this guidance now implicitly builds some incremental flexibility into the second half of the year for macroeconomic uncertainty. Throughout different macro environments, we will remain focused on making the right long-term decisions for the business, striking an appropriate balance between investment and productivity. For the second quarter, we expect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, which is impacted by the Braintree renegotiation efforts I discussed earlier. We've seen a good start to April, and are watching trends closely.\nTariff-related concerns and news flow have likely resulted in some spend being pulled forward for certain verticals in the US. We are not assuming that those higher activity levels persist for the entire quarter. We expect second quarter transaction margin dollars to be between $3.75 and 3.8 billion, which represents 4.5% growth at the midpoint. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect transaction margin dollars to increase by approximately 6.5% at the midpoint. We are planning for mid-single-digit non-transaction OpEx growth in the quarter due to the timing of initiatives and marketing spend, and we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to 1.31, or 9% growth at the midpoint. For the full year, we are maintaining our guidance, as I mentioned earlier, and I'll just highlight a couple of lines.\nExcluding interest on customer balances, we expect transaction margin dollars to grow by at least 5% compared to 4.6% growth in 2024, and we expect to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, representing about 8% growth in the midpoint. This includes negative impact from lower interest rates and, compared to our prior guidance, a smaller headwind from our expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Our guidance continues to assume approximately $6 billion in share buyback for the full year, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately $6 to $7 billion. I'd like to wrap up by thanking the PayPal team for their continued focus and dedication. We have a solid foundation to build on as we execute on the second year of PayPal's transformation. With that, back to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Jamie.\nTo summarize, we had a great start to the year, and our strategy is taking hold. We've built a solid foundation and have multiple ways to win. A huge thank you to the PayPal team for their focus on delivering for our customers and our business. Steve, let's go to Q&A.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Paulie, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tianxin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks for the progress report here.\nLots to talk about. Just wanted to maybe ask the obligatory macro question, if you don't mind. I'd love to hear a little bit more on how you characterize consumer and SMB health overall. I know you touched upon it a little bit, but is the macro, the geopolitical stuff that's going on in the world, is that changing enough for you to reorder some of your priorities? It does sound like you're leaning harder into BNPL and Venmo, but yeah, just a broader macro question.Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nHey, Kenjen, thanks for the question. I wouldn't say we're reordering any priorities. I don't think we're obviously watching it very closely to see what plays out, but things have been pretty consistent so far. Obviously, we think there's an opportunity. You mentioned buy now, pay later.\nWe think with our strong position there and strong product, there's obviously an opportunity to continue to lean in. I think from a consumer standpoint, we've been building over the last few quarters to really be the most rewarding way for consumers to pay, and we think that's an opportunity for us to continue to get our message out, our rewards coming back on debit card, the rewards we just put out on crypto. These are things that put more money in the pockets of consumers, and that's a positive thing, and an opportunity for us. On small business, again, we know that cash flow is the most critical part for small businesses.\nWe haven't seen a big impact yet, but as they think about money in, money out, and access to capital, we know that we have tremendous strength when it comes to providing capital to our small business customers, and we think we can be a place for them to come in times of need. I'd say we're still early, and we haven't seen any big shifts yet, but we feel confident in our position if those things happen.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah, Kenjen, I would just add that when you look just at the core credit portfolios as a monitor of some of your question around consumer health or merchant health, we monitor that very closely. Charge-off rates are stable, and in some cases improving. In particular, with respect to the consumer portfolios, we've actually seen delinquencies over the last 30 days improve.\nAs it relates to just broader consumer trend, the first part of April, we saw an uplift as well in terms of TPV, and a lot of folks have referenced that as pull-in. When you look at just general consumer health coming into what could be a more uncertain time, it's looking pretty healthy and pretty good. With respect to SMB, good continued consistent performance there too. On the merchant lending side, as we monitor that, honestly, pretty consistent with what I'd say about consumer charge-offs also improving. Obviously, we're monitoring the whole thing very, very carefully, but it looks pretty steady right now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Dan Dulick from Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nDan Dulick\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, guys. Great results here. Really appreciate it.\nCan you give us a sense of it looks like the Branded Experiences TPV strategy is doing really well? Can you give us maybe a sense of how much traction you're getting there and what you're doing to get those nice results? Thanks again.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, Dan, let me start. Good to hear from you. This is the strategy that we've laid out really coming to life. First, we have a Branded Checkout strategy that is really about driving habituation everywhere that a customer wants to pay. We have such strong brands in both PayPal and Venmo, and our customers are asking to be able to leverage that trust, the safety, the brand, the rewards in every purchase that they make.\nWe've been focused on not only improving that online experience that we've talked about, and I'm sure we'll talk about more, making it available for them exactly how they want to pay, whether that's immediately or with a pay later scenario with buy now, pay later, but then also offline. You mentioned branded experiences. This really is enabling our PayPal Debit Card or our Venmo Debit Card to be accessible to our consumers. We saw PayPal Debit Card TPV growth over 100% in Q1, and that really is driving habituation. This is driving our consumers to actually start to come back, move online, and start to pay with PayPal wherever they see it. The strategy is working. TPV up 8% overall in branded experiences.\nThis really is the metric that we are focused on, and we hope you're focused on as well because, again, it is really all about the strategy that we've laid out.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi. Thank you very much for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the de minimis tariff exemption for China. I think that's scheduled to be eliminated on 2 May 2024. Do you expect an impact from that? I guess, and if so, if you could help us dimensionalize the impact, I would appreciate it.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah, good morning. Obviously, the whole situation around tariffs is really changing daily, and there are multiple scenarios that could unfold. Maybe I'd first start by saying I think we come into this from a position of strength. We are globally diversified.\nOur merchant base, our region base, it's just very, very global and diverse, and we're well-positioned to capture shifts in spending as they happen. The other thing I would just add is, in particular, in the US, we are about 50/50 between retail and services, so diversification there as well. When you talk about de minimis, the way I'd size that for you, our Chinese merchants selling into the US is less than 2% of our branded checkout TPV. This includes both direct China to US cross-border transactions and volume from Chinese merchants with US entities, but where they're shipping from China. From that perspective, that's probably how I'd size it there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Darren Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks.\nMaybe just go a little further, if you don't mind, into what's embedded in your outlook around KPIs and modeling assumptions. Totally understand not changing guidance despite the beat. If you could help us with assumptions on the macro front of what you're embedding in your outlook, especially around cross-border and China, and just what we should think about being included, as well as even just give us a little more color on branded growth expectations. What are you seeing specifically in April right now from a branded growth rate standpoint? Branded versus unbranded growth as the year progresses would be really helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nSorry, Darren. I'm just writing down all your questions here. Let me start with the macro question.\nI think Alex was alluding to this before. I would start by saying, as we look at this year, we are laser-focused on what we can control, staying focused on delivering for customers, and really executing around our core initiatives and our investments. When we look at the macro and forecasting, it's really difficult to predict kind of which way all these scenarios could land. I would just say maybe that we're prudently guiding. Despite a strong first quarter and second quarter guide, we're maintaining our full year guide just given the macro uncertainty. It builds in room for a range of consumer activity softening in the second half. Overall, I'd say it covers about 2 to 3 points of deceleration in overall e-com trends in the second half, which is not what we see as run rate. Current performance is really trending well.\nWhen you think about two to three points of e-com, I think about that as two to three points of TPV plus some level of lower credit originations, maybe a little bit of credit losses, maybe some FBO impact or interest rate impact from some rate shifting. That's roughly how I'd package it from that perspective. When you ask about April and branded trends, branded has had pretty consistent trending as what we saw in the fourth quarter. In April, in particular, we saw some US consumer activity accelerating. I mentioned before it's likely a pull forward. We're not assuming that continues. All in, we're on track for a mid-single-digit branded checkout TPV guide, what we gave earlier this year. You also asked about branded and unbranded and how to think about, I think, the revenue side of that.\nMaybe I'll just anchor there around the unbranded side of that. You saw that pullback this quarter that was expected. That deceleration really began in the second half of last year. The one thing I would say about unbranded or PSP and VAS is that it's been a very strong and growing contributor to transaction margin dollars. While revenue is shifting down, we're seeing nice contribution to TM as we really just sort of shift that margin profile of the business over time. Second quarter on revenue, we expect a pretty similar profile to the first quarter, and then a second-half ramp. Overall, continuing to contribute to that transaction margin growth for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you.\nLooks like online branded, you were stable on an underlying basis here in Q1 at up 6%. Now we've got almost half the US on the new checkout experience. Sounds like Europe is on tap to start pretty soon. Could we start to see some initial acceleration in online branded volume growth by the end of this year if the macro stays stable? Can you just give us a word on what the US versus international branded split looked like in terms of Q1 growth rates? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nHey, Jason. Thanks. Again, just to unpack our branded strategy, I'd really think about it as three parts. One is the improved branded checkout experience. As you mentioned, we've moved very quickly, up now over 45% in the US. That still is, think of that as sort of low double digits of our global transactions.\nWe're really excited. We think we've got a really strong playbook now, and we think as we start to roll this out into Europe, we'll actually accelerate even faster. Our PaySheet redesign is holding, the improvement is holding, and now this is just about scaling. Second lever is really accelerating Pay with Venmo, and you've seen the results there. Very, very fast flywheel starting to happen from a Pay with Venmo perspective. TPV up over 50% and MAAs up over 30%. The third lever is buy now, pay later in our pay later products. Again, TPV up over 20%.\nYou add all three of those together, and as we continue to see us leaning into those three levers, I don't know the exact timing of when we'll start to see branded checkout, but we put pretty strong growth numbers of 8% to 10% by 2027. I think those three levers continue to give us confidence that we're executing well and heading in that direction.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nGood. Jason, what I would just add to that, when you look at the PaySheet redesign, I would say we think about that as ramping over time. I mean, this is something that as things come on, transactions start flowing. It's not something that is an immediate translation. We do see impact coming through the numbers, but it's very small so far. Maybe that's how I would position that piece of it.\nWhen you look at the US and international, I guess I'd start with the US and say performance was relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. We're beginning to see good traction across US MAAs, across TPA, across shifting to more upstream to more power users. Alex mentioned Pay with Venmo, which really had good traction there. It is early, but we talked in the fourth quarter about seeing some shifting in our US branded checkout levels. We saw that hold again this quarter, watching it very closely, but cautiously optimistic about that. On the outside of the US side, relatively consistent as well. A little bit of macro volatility across some markets, but in Europe, we continue to take share in continental Europe, including in Germany. Really strong brand presence, as you know, across merchants, across consumers.\nI think what we're really excited about is that we're bringing our new product innovation to the market in Europe starting this quarter. We'll start with Germany and the UK. This is the checkout redesign. It is buy now, pay later. It is Omni and NFC launches, and brand marketing to accompany all of that, with a fast follow to other countries after that. I think the overall look right now, we feel pretty good about branded checkout and just laser-focused on our execution.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, Alex. Hey, Jamie. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe we could switch gears to the consumer side. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the PayPal Everywhere program. Obviously, some rich rewards across categories there.\nCould you talk a little bit about the halo effect, if any, that you're seeing outside of those categories? I'm curious just about adoption and spend trends with that program now that it's been in place for some time. Thank you so much.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Thank you, Andrew. What you mentioned is exactly what we're starting to see. Just as a reminder, rolled out PayPal Everywhere. We really launched it in sort of August, September of last year. Since then, 4 million new debit card active. Really starting to see strong demand from our consumer base that loves the brand and wants to be able to use PayPal everywhere that they shop. TPV growth, again, up over 100% in Q1 with attractive economics in offline as well.\nIt's not just delivering the habituation that we want for every purchase, but the offline spend is actually quite attractive. What's exciting is, though, that halo effect. We're starting to see that debit card users have a 5.5% to 6% lift in transaction activity and over 2x increase in average revenue per active user versus just a checkout only. This is the strategy starting to take hold. This is a user that's now becoming habituated with PayPal. They're enjoying the rewards in the category of their choice, and we're also starting to see the spend and the category demand actually extend to other categories outside. We started with things I've mentioned in the past: gas, groceries, restaurants, things that consumers have never used PayPal for before. Now we're starting to add new everyday spend categories like rideshare and transit.\nDemand is really strong from these consumers. We're starting to see the halo effect of not just offline, but now moving into online. This is why this all comes back to this habituation and this branded experiences journey that we think is going to work first in the US. As Jamie just mentioned, really excited to see this roll out in Germany and in the UK. With Germany as an example coming this quarter, we've got some really exciting buy now, pay later opportunities, which are, I think, going to be very, very powerful in a market that has traditionally not been a credit market, but one that's been connected to bank that we think we can come in with our already connected bank product and actually give consumers the ability to make the purchases they need on a buy now, pay later product.\nAgain, lots of exciting innovation coming and the flywheel starting to spin.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning, Alex, Jamie. I have a clarification question about the conversion update you're seeing as you're rolling out the new checkout to merchants. I think it talked about 100 basis points up and 100 basis points in one-time checkout. Are these numbers holding as you roll out these experiences to more merchants? How quickly can you roll out the new checkout in Europe? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYou broke up a bit, Harshita. You got it, Jamie?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nI think so, yeah. First, I think the first part of the question was talk about conversion uplift as we roll out the new checkout redesign. We talked about 100 basis points of conversion uplift. Is that holding? I'd say yes.\nThat is what we're seeing continue to come through in the results that we have. Your second part of your question was how quickly can we roll this out in Europe? What I would say is a really important point here is that a much higher proportion of our European merchants are already on our latest integration. This makes a much faster and easier rollout process for them as we tackle Europe.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nIf we didn't get that whole question, Harshita, we can follow up later.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Sanjay Sakrani from KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning. OVAS revenue growth was quite strong.\nI was wondering, Jamie, if you could just walk through sort of where the strength was and if it outperformed relative to your expectations and if you expect that strength to continue over the course of the year. Thanks.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah. Good morning. When we look at OVAS, there's one thing I would just call out before I talk about the actual quarter, which is that in the first quarter of 2024, we did have lower credit revenue with a lower gain share on our consumer credit partner. As we had coming through COVID, we had some loss normalization happening there. Last year's first quarter was slightly lower in that regard. If you remember, we had also pulled back on our merchant lending portfolios, so revenue was lower there as well.\nAs we come into this year, I mentioned on our fourth quarter call that we're really back in the market with a rebuilt credit team and just really good capability. We saw that growth come through. Again, OVAS growth this quarter was primarily credit-driven, both consumer and merchant. Small contribution from interest. I mentioned the portfolio is performing well. We feel really good about it. We're very actively managing it. As we look at the year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit OVAS growth. Credit will continue to be a primary driver this year, but you might remember that we also have baked into our forecast about $150 million of impact of interest rate headwinds, which also runs through OVAS as well.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Timothy Choto from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Choto\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question.\nI want to dig in a little bit more to Germany and the UK. I believe they're the two largest branded markets outside of the US, particularly from a gross profit standpoint. I believe they're two of the largest markets for branded. Two topics I was hoping we could touch on. One is a little bit about the competitive landscape in those two markets specifically. On the UK, I know that there were some efforts to roll out biometrics to help with two-factor authentication. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the progress and the phasing of that initiative.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Let me get started, Tim. As you said, two very important markets for us and strong markets outside of the US. Competitive dynamics a little bit different, so let me unpack them. Germany, we are really the market leader there.\nI think we're the number one brand in Germany for the last three years. Very, very strong consumer presence, very strong merchant presence. It's also a different type of market. As I just mentioned, it's not a credit-heavy market. The way PayPal is used is we're connected to bank, and then PayPal is used as really the way to make an online purchase. Our transactions in e-commerce in Germany are extremely high. That gives us a lot of confidence as we now move into offline. We're really going to be one of the first at-scale bank-connected offline wallets that we think will be able to drive significant penetration into the market. We're really excited about that, as well as bringing some new innovations to market with not only our rewards program, but also the buy now, pay later connected element as well.\nWith the brand presence we've got in Germany, with the banks already connected and the onboarding experience that's just really delightful, I mean, it's literally one click from your bank to be able to set up your offline wallet. With the innovations of rewards and buy now, pay later, we're really excited to get into the market there. UK, much more competitive dynamic there. We've really suffered in the last few years with what I would consider to be one of our poorest app experiences for consumers. We're rolling out a new app experience in the UK shortly, but we've already started with, as you mentioned, the biometrics. We actually got a favorable connection with the regulator there to enable our biometrics to be considered two-factor authentication. That's rolling out quickly and enabling a much better experience.\nWhereas before, it really was choppy and created a lot of friction and a lot of latency in the experience. Biometrics is now really creating a seamless experience. You add on top of that the new app that's going to be rolling out, our rewards program, and all the other innovation that we've brought to bear. We think we're going to be competing quite well in the UK. You'll see us leaning in from a go-to-market perspective as well to really remind consumers that we now have the best product in the market. The last thing I'd say is I was actually just there a few weeks ago, and I think there's a big opportunity for us in buy now, pay later. Actually, I sat down with a lot of merchants in the market, and they're really looking for PayPal to come in.\nare a lot of different options that are available now. I think we're hearing from merchants that PayPal is a beloved, trusted brand that they would love to be able to have their consumers have a single one-time checkout or buy now, pay later option from a single brand. We're going to lean in heavily in buy now, pay later in the UK as well.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nFinancial Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning. I just wanted to revisit cross-border for a moment and kind of maybe the puts and takes in terms of dynamics that we need to be thinking about.\nOne of those is just kind of now that we have a situation where we have this weak dollar, how does the purchasing power parity associated with a weaker dollar typically play out for you guys in terms of cross-border behavior? If you could just also give any color as a reminder of kind of discretionary versus non-discretionary spending bents that tend to fall heavy in cross-border. Thank you.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah. Good morning, Dan. How are you? I'll start with the discretionary side of it. When you look at PayPal today, I would say discretionary spend, we are a lot more diversified today than we were a few years ago. Now we're about 50/50 split in our US TPV between goods and services, and even in those categories, we are diverse as well.\nI mean, when you look at that, just breaking down retail as an example, about 10% of that is fashion, but then it's really split across a lot of different things, between variety and discount, beauty, sports, pets, toys, lots of different things. When you look at this, I mentioned before, I think we're really positioned well to capture spend as it may shift amongst categories, and we're well positioned around that. When you look at the cross-border side of it, what I would really say there, again, is it's really diversified. I talked before about the China to US direct. A large portion of our cross-border is intra-European corridors. When you start to look at how this looks over the globe, it's just very well diversified.\nIt's really hard to say how a shifting dollar is going to impact that and honestly what will actually happen there. I would just say if we take a step back and think about our guidance here, our process, we're just planning prudently and preparing for some level of uncertainty.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nHey, Paul. Paulie, we'll make time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from a line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs",
    "content2": "Hey, I appreciate you taking the question. I just wanted to—you said several times on the merchant lending portfolio that you guys are actively managing standards in the current environment. I'm just wondering if you've made any changes to underwriting or how you would think about changes to underwriting in the face of merchants facing kind of cash flow strains on the back of sort of supply chain dynamics, tariffs specifically.\nIf you guys have any way of sort of dimensionalizing what sort of cash flow strains your merchants may experience if tariffs do go into effect in terms of things like importing inventory and things of that nature, thank you.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nChief Financial and Operating Officer, PayPal\n\nYeah, I think it's difficult to answer the latter part of your question, but if we go back to the merchant lending part of it, this is a portfolio that is actively managed. It's something that a year ago when Michelle McGill came in and really reconstituted the team, they're very focused on how we can help our small businesses really navigate growth. The portfolio has a couple of different things in it. One is just really helping small businesses with working capital and inventory buy. We monitor that and underwrite it with an eye towards credit, towards cash flow.\nWhen you look at this, these are things where we've got cash sweeps with sales as sales come in. It's just a very well-constructed portfolio from both an underwriting and a risk management perspective. The other side of it is PayPal business loans, which are cash flow-based. They're typically personally guaranteed. Again, these are things that we monitor, all the different indicators of the portfolio, and we adjust as we go. I mean, we did make some adjustments in March to tweak and fine-tune and make our underwriting slightly more conservative, but it's something the team is all over. I think we can react very quickly in a changing environment.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Jamie. Alex, any final thoughts?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Thanks, everyone, for the call this morning. I'm very proud of the quarter that the team delivered.\nNot only great results, but also just the innovation and the pace that the teams are moving. We didn't get a chance to talk a lot about Venmo, but I know I mentioned it on the call. We've leaned in there, and the innovation is really starting to take hold. We talked about moving into monetization and debit card just to give you another data point. 10% of the new cohort of users are now adopting the debit card, right? This is showing our innovation coming to life. Funds in Venmo users that are using and keeping funds in, we're seeing funds beyond P2P up over 100%. Add funds and auto-reload, really, as we've innovated, they're starting to become the habituation for our consumers. Just goes to show that as we are executing and leading into our strategy, our innovation is really taking hold. We're focused.\nWe'll continue to scale our innovation and look forward to updating you along the way. Take care, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's Q4 and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. I'm joined by CEO Alex Chriss, and CFO Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now, over to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal had a successful 2024, delivering strong operating and financial results. The improvements we've made to branded checkout, P2P, and Venmo, plus the progress we've made on our price-to-value strategy, are beginning to show up in our results. We set out at the beginning of 2024 to make it a transition year, to narrow our focus, and to make sure we are executing the initiatives that matter the most to the growth of our business. One year later, I'm proud that we've laid a strong foundation for durable growth.\nWe drove branded checkout transaction margin dollar growth in each quarter. US branded checkout growth accelerated in the Q4 to exit the year at a high point as our new checkout innovations are scaling to customers.\nDriven by a renewed focus on pricing to value, Braintree has meaningfully contributed to our transaction margin dollar growth over the last three quarters. Venmo monetization is making great strides, with over 20% growth in Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo monthly active accounts. Put simply, the PayPal team executed well during our transition year, and made strong progress on our transformation. The investments we made throughout 2024 allowed us to perform well during the holiday shopping season and finish the year strongly. Total active accounts returned to growth in 2024 as we enhanced our value proposition and brought innovation to market.\nTotal payment volume grew 10% to nearly $1.7 trillion. We delivered $32 billion in revenue, up 7%. We reached an inflection point for transaction margin dollar growth, which increased 5%, excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share increased 21% year over year. We generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow and completed $6 billion in share buybacks. For 2025, we expect another solid year of transaction margin dollar growth and strong free cash flow, which Jamie will discuss. As we look ahead to 2025, I want to share the areas we're most focused on. First is innovation. With the leadership team in place and the velocity with which we're executing, we've proven we can bring innovations to market. In 2024, we rolled out new branded checkout experiences, launched PayPal Everywhere, introduced FastLane, and expanded PayPal Complete Payments.\nWe are not stopping there and will continue to innovate to solve our customers' biggest challenges. The second is product adoption. 2025 will be focused on scaling adoption of our innovations.\nWe have world-class products and solutions, and will continue educating customers about all we have to offer. In 2024, we completely revamped our marketing and go-to-market playbook. We're just scratching the surface, so you can expect more ahead. Third is partnerships. Last year, we formed significant partnerships to drive FastLane adoption and bring more value to customers. We are building on our leadership position in payments and commerce, and establishing ourselves as the platform that leading brands want to work with. We will strike even more partnerships throughout 2025. Fourth is efficiency and effectiveness.\nIn 2024, we reduced headcount by 10%. We made deliberate investments in AI and automation, which are critical to our future. This year, we are prioritizing the use of AI to improve the customer experience, and drive efficiency and effectiveness within PayPal. We expect to make meaningful progress on all four of these areas in 2025.\nLet me walk you through how this focus will drive our results this year and beyond. In 2025, our key strategic initiatives will be to win checkout, scale Omni, grow Venmo, and accelerate SMB. Our teams are organized around these priorities, and tracking progress daily. Starting with win checkout, our number one priority. With our upgraded experiences, we now have the leading checkout solution on desktop and mobile. When fully implemented, the upgraded experiences reduce latency by more than 40% and drive more than 100 basis points of conversion lift on average, consistent with the early results we've shared.\nThese upgrades are now live for more than 25% of US checkout traffic, which is up from 5% last quarter. We have a lot of room to grow here as adoption increases in the US, and then expands globally.\nOn top of the benefit of higher conversion, these new experiences improve the presentment of our branded marks and solutions like Buy Now Pay Later, which can help to expand our share of wallet. BNPL customers spend 30% more on average, and merchants see higher sales after adding BNPL messaging to their sites, which is critical when one more sale can make all the difference. In 2024, we drove approximately $33 billion in BNPL total payment volume, growing 21% from the prior year. Consumers and merchants trust the PayPal brand and experience. We have a lot more we can do with BNPL in the next year.\nMerchants continue to show strong interest in FastLane. In the Q4, we focused on selling FastLane to large brands that can drive future volume. I'm excited to share that we have signed NBCUniversal, Roku, and StockX, and are working on implementation.\nWe now have nearly 2,000 merchants up and running with FastLane. We expect an inflection point in adoption when we expand our go-to-market efforts and bring FastLane to even more merchants through Adyen, Global Payments, and Fiserv this year. From early data, what's exciting is that 25% of FastLane users have never had a PayPal account before, and more than half have a PayPal account but haven't been active in the last 12 months. To say that simply, 75% of FastLane consumers are new or dormant PayPal users. This means that FastLane not only improves conversion for our merchants, but also introduces more shoppers to PayPal, and enables us to re-engage inactive users.\nWe've shared that one of our strategies is to build deeper relationships with our largest merchants as we renegotiate deals to reflect the value we provide.\nA key part of that is adding value-added services that improve the experience for our mutual customers. We built a suite of world-class value-added services, and continue to introduce new ones. In the Q4, we launched FX-as-a-Service, which is automated currency conversion, and it's already live for Meta. We also actively scaled the use of network tokens for automated billing capabilities, which is live with merchants, including Instacart, Mint Mobile, and Poshmark. The expansion of our value-added services is a key driver of the transaction margin dollar growth we are delivering.\nNext, let's talk about our initiative to expand beyond e-commerce to become truly Omnichannel. We launched PayPal Everywhere in September, which is driving significant increases in debit card adoption, and opening new categories of spend.\nWe added more than 1.5 million first-time PayPal Debit Card users in the Q4, and debit card TPV was up nearly 100% in Q4. Our most active reward categories are gas, groceries, and restaurants. These new capabilities are driving deeper relationships with our users, and more PayPal volume overall, offline and online. The average debit card actives generate five times the transaction activity, and two times the average revenue per account compared to users who only use branded checkout. This is leading to habituation. Power users, which are PayPal consumer accounts transacting more than 100x per year, grew more than 9% year-over-year in the Q4.\nWe are seeing strong momentum today with our Omnichannel push, but we're just getting started. We plan to expand our PayPal Everywhere value proposition to several European markets this year, including launching NFC capabilities in Germany.\nMoving to our progress to grow Venmo, our task is twofold. First, continue to improve the social P2P payment experience that made Venmo a virth, increasing engagement, and bringing on more users. Second, drive adoption of our monetized products, including the Venmo debit card, and Pay with Venmo. In the Q4, we continued improving the Venmo experience by giving our users more of the capabilities they've been asking for, like scheduled sends and improved search. With these steady improvements to the experience, we see engagement increasing. Our engaged Venmo user base grew 4% in the quarter, reaching more than 64 million monthly active accounts.\nOn monetization, we increased the average revenue per active Venmo account in 2024, and we plan to build on that growth in 2025.\nMonetized Venmo monthly active accounts beyond P2P and instant transfers grew more than 20% in the Q4, driven by the adoption of Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo. Venmo debit card monthly actives grew more than 30%, and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew more than 20%. We continue to expand Venmo's acceptance with major brands like Instacart and MoonPay, adding Venmo in the Q4. As we recently announced, JetBlue became the first airline to accept Venmo for flight bookings. While we are still early in monetizing Venmo, we have a proven playbook that is resonating with customers.\nThis gives us confidence as we move to 2025 and beyond. Finally, I'd like to cover our efforts to accelerate growth for SMBs. We are moving from a disparate set of payment products to building an end-to-end suite of solutions that solves more small business needs.\nPayPal Complete Payments was the first step towards an integrated suite of solutions, and we continue to make progress driving adoption, with 45% of SMB processing and checkout volume now on this platform. Merchants on PPCP benefit from our upgraded branded checkout experiences. Key to our success in growing with small businesses on our platform is our expanding set of connected, and value-added services, which move us beyond a payment provider to a growth partner, and help us retain customers throughout their business lifecycle. Take, for example, our merchant financing solutions.\nEntrepreneurs come to us for payment services as they start their business. As their business grows, they need access to capital to buy inventory, invest in marketing, and hire. PayPal Working Capital is a financing solution purpose-built for early-stage companies.\nAs the business matures, PayPal Business Loan offers more traditional merchant financing to match the increasing complexity and multi-channel nature of larger businesses. Our business financing solutions increase loyalty and engagement, driving the PayPal flywheel. Merchants typically increase their PayPal volume by 36% after adopting PayPal Working Capital, and 16% after taking a PayPal Business Loan. Our merchant lending originations were $3 billion in 2024, demonstrating our leadership and that there's plenty of room to grow to support our customers. This is just one example of the services we offer that help SMBs change the trajectory of their businesses.\nExpanding this ecosystem of value-added services is a focus in 2025 and beyond. To close out, I want to thank the PayPal team for their focus on delivering for customers every day. I am proud of how far we have come in the last year.\nIt was an important transition year for PayPal. We created strong momentum that sets up well for 2025 and beyond. We are now executing a game plan that we have confidence in, and I'm excited to share more at our Investor Day later this month. With that, over to Jamie.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Alex. Moving to slide seven, PayPal delivered another solid quarter of results to end the year. While there's still more work to be done, the team is making progress, building on the firm foundation that we have established. As we enter the second year of the company's transformation, our teams are energized and moving quickly. We remain focused on better serving our customers as we seek to drive durable, profitable growth. Looking at the high-level financial results in the Q4, revenue grew 4% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis.\nFor the full year, revenue grew 7% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 7% in the Q4, or 6% excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Outperformance compared to our guidance was driven by higher contribution from branded checkout and Venmo, credit performance, and interest earned on customer balances. For the full year, transaction margin dollars grew 7%, or 5% excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19 in the quarter, up 5%. We ended the full year with $4.65 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 21%.\nThese full-year results benefited from a return to transaction margin dollar growth fueled by our transformation efforts, expense discipline, the higher interest rate environment, and a strong capital return program. Turning to slide eight, our operating metrics reflect another quarter of steady progress.\nTotal active accounts increased by nearly 3 million from the Q3 and nearly 9 million from last year to 434 million. Monthly active accounts also continued to show steady progress, up 2% year over year to 229 million, with contributions from PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account, excluding PSP processing, grew 4%. Moving to slide nine, total payment volume grew 7% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $438 billion. For the full year, TPV grew to nearly $1.7 trillion, up 10% on a spot and currency-neutral basis. Looking at the TPV breakdown by product, we see strength starting to build in some key areas.\nPayPal P2P accelerated for the sixth consecutive quarter to 6% growth. Venmo also accelerated by two points to 10% growth. Steady, incremental product improvements, combined with reinvigorated marketing campaigns, are starting to make an impact.\nGlobal branded checkout volumes increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis in the Q4. This was about a 50 basis point acceleration from the prior quarter. Underlying this growth, we were encouraged to see US branded checkout volume improve in the Q4. Part of this increase can be attributed to a healthy spending environment and specific vertical exposure. In the US, we are focused on scaling our modern, best-in-class experiences. From a merchant perspective, we continue to see the greatest strength across large enterprises, platforms, and marketplaces. Winning checkout remains our most critical priority.\nOur goal is to drive more consumer engagement and a higher PayPal selection rate, which should accelerate TPV over time. Turning to PSP, as discussed throughout the past year, we moved rapidly within our Braintree business to prioritize healthy, profitable growth and intentionally let go of unprofitable volume.\nIn line with this strategy, PSP processing volume grew 2% in the Q4 compared to 11% in the Q3. Our conversations with merchants have become more holistic, moving beyond price and share of card processing to a deeper appreciation of our customers' needs, and how we can add value through our full suite of solutions. We expect a handful of large Braintree merchant renegotiations to result in a headwind to revenue growth of about five points in 2025. Shifting away from this volume pressures gross revenue, but is accretive to transaction margin dollars and will result in more than one-point benefit this year.\nWe expect this benefit to build over time, as we drive more value-added services. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to work through renegotiations, at which point we should reach a new baseline to drive faster volume and revenue growth.\nMoving to more financial detail on slide 10, transaction revenue grew 4% on a spot basis to $7.6 billion, driven primarily by branded checkout and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter grew 5% to $778 million. This acceleration was driven largely by a return to growth in credit revenue. We continue to see solid performance across our credit portfolio. As Alex shared, we have begun to modestly grow merchant originations and expect credit to be a positive revenue and profit driver in 2025. Transaction take rate declined by four basis points to 1.73%, driven largely by mix.\nVenmo monetization was a slight benefit, offset by merchant mix within branded checkout and Braintree, faster growth in payouts, and foreign exchange. Turning to transaction margin dollars, the largest contributors were branded checkout, Venmo, interest on customer balances, a return to growth in credit, and Braintree.\nTransaction margin percent increased by more than 100 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our focus on price to value and profitable growth. As planned, we increased our level of strategic investment in the quarter, growing non-transaction operating expense by 10%. This growth included marketing spend deferred from the first half of the year, and efforts to support the rollout of new products and initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin declined 34 basis points to 18%. PayPal generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing full-year free cash flow to $6.8 billion.\nThis is meaningfully ahead of the $5 billion we planned for at the start of the year, and includes some benefit from lower cash taxes, which we expect to be a headwind in 2025.\nIn the quarter, we completed $1.2 billion in share repurchases, bringing full-year share repurchases to $6 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $15.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and $11.1 billion in debt. Moving to guidance on slide 11 for the Q1 and full year 2025, for the Q1, we expect flat to low single-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, which is heavily impacted by the Braintree renegotiation efforts I discussed earlier. This also includes about a one-point headwind from lapping last year's leap day. We expect transaction margin dollars to be between $3.6 and 3.65 billion, which represents 5% growth at the midpoint.\nWe are planning for low single-digit non-transaction OpEx growth in the quarter, and we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to 1.17, or approximately 7% growth at the midpoint.\nMoving to the full year, we plan to continue guiding revenue one quarter at a time. We believe this approach has served the company well during our transformation, enabling healthy, long-term decision-making that prioritizes driving faster transaction margin dollar growth. Over time, we are focused on accelerating both revenue and profitability. For the full year, we expect transaction margin dollars of approximately $15.2 to 15.4 billion, representing approximately 4.5% growth at the midpoint. In 2024, we had a two-point benefit from interest on customer balances.\nFor 2025, our guidance includes about a $150 million, or about a one-point headwind due to interest rate cuts. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect transaction margin dollars to grow by at least 5% compared to 4.6% growth in 2024.\nIn the Q1, we expect minimal benefit from growth of interest on customer balances, and then a headwind for the remainder of the year. One other factor to keep in mind is that in 2024, we saw a one-point benefit from transaction loss improvements. We are planning for some normalization in transaction loss during 2025 as we roll out new products. Our focus in 2025 is to strike the right balance between investment and productivity, seeking to fund long-term investments largely through savings generated from better tech and automation deployment. We expect full-year non-transaction operating expenses to increase in the low single-digit range.\nThere will likely be some unevenness quarter to quarter due to the timing of initiatives, marketing spend, and comparisons to the prior year. As a result, we expect Q2 OpEx growth to be higher than in other periods.\nWe expect to deliver full-year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.95 to 5.10, representing about 8% growth at the midpoint. This includes negative impact from lower interest rates and just over a two-point increase in our expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Our guidance also includes approximately $6 billion in share buyback, and we expect full-year free cash flow of approximately $6 to 7 billion. I'd like to wrap up by thanking the PayPal team for their continued focus and dedication. The progress we made in 2024 gives us a strong foundation to build on as we move into the second year of PayPal's transformation.\nOne of our primary focuses this year will be driving adoption of recent innovation, and scaling better customer experiences.\nIt will take time for some of our efforts to build and drive financial impact, but we are confident in our roadmap and in our execution plans, and we're excited to share more with you at our Investor Day on 25 February. With that, back to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Jamie. To summarize, in 2024, we executed the transition plan we laid out. We have positioned PayPal to compete and win, and delivered strong results along the way. I'm very proud of our team and the impact they made during a year of intense change. The momentum we have created sets us up well for 2025, which is about scaling adoption. It is still early in our transformation, but our objective is clear. We are evolving PayPal from a payments company to a commerce platform that helps merchants win every sale, and helps consumers shop smarter. Steve, let's go to Q&A.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Sarah, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, Alex and Jamie. Good to see the next stage of the transformation here. I wanted to just dig in on branded volume growth. Maybe you could just unpack the Q4 performance, particularly in the US. How did it sort of trend relative to your expectation in terms of share of checkout?\nAs we think about 2025, what are the right expectations to set for branded volume growth? I know you mentioned a few things that are drivers there, new checkout integrations, reinvigorating the consumer side. Maybe just remind us, what are the biggest unlocks and the timeframe to see those come into play? Thanks so much.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thank you, Andrew. Let me kick off and then hand it over to Jamie. First, let me just remind us of the context of what we walked into at 2024 on branded checkout. I talked about it throughout the course of the year as our number one priority, and most of it was focused on how do we improve the customer experience. We felt good about the desktop experience, but clearly gaps in mobile.\nThat was innovation that the team really executed on throughout 2024, tested a number of different pay sheets, a number of different vaulted experiences. By the time we got to 2024, felt really good about the innovation we were rolling out. As we started to roll out, just as a reminder, our one-time checkout improvement is 400 basis points on conversion. Our vaulted improvement is 100 basis points on conversion. The biggest impact is really on our mobile and our small business base. Really excited about the innovation that's now rolling out. As we talked about in Q3, we had just started the rollout.\nWe'd ramped that to about 5%. Throughout Q4, we continued to execute on our rollout and got that up to 25% by the end of the year.\nAs we exit 2024, I'm feeling really good about the quality of the innovation, our ability to roll it out, and impact customers. As we look to 2025, we now have, I believe, the best-in-class experience on desktop, on mobile, and starting to see knock-on effects of things like our buy now, pay later attach, which is up 20% with this new pay sheet. From an innovation perspective and a customer impact perspective, feeling really good as we go into 2025.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Andrew, good morning. Just to add on there with respect to the US, we did see sequential improvement in branded checkout in the US in the Q4. That was about three points of growth quarter over quarter, really due to market dynamics, but also specific key vertical exposure around travel, crypto, gaming, etc.\nAlex mentioned we're still early in the ramp of our modern checkout experience, and that is certainly something that as we get into 2025, we are very, very focused on. Our biggest priorities are really around innovation, driving those improvements in checkout experience. You mentioned also giving consumers more reasons to choose. Some of the things we've done throughout the year around really improving the app experience, adding rewards, adding different elements to how people can find contacts and things like that, all of that is around engaging the consumer in a different way. As we talk about internally, really getting the flywheel continuing to move between our consumers and our merchant experience.\nFrom a 2025 guide perspective, we still expect branded checkout TPV to grow about mid-single digits and to have consistent growth from last year into this year, with some acceleration with our initiatives on top of that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question this morning. As expected, unbranded volume decelerated again as you pursue the price-to-value strategy. Can you give us your updated thoughts on your sort of confidence level, timing, and toolkit to re-accelerate unbranded volume growth at the higher baseline profitability levels as we move forward here?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Let me just touch on, thanks for the question, Ramsey. Let me touch on just how these conversations are evolving. First, again, this has been our strategy throughout the year.\nI'm encouraged to see just another quarter of unbranded Braintree contribution to TM dollar growth. The conversations are continuing to be strategic in nature, which is exciting for us. We're having not just processing conversations, but now they're sort of evolving into two steps. One is the value-added services that we're bringing to market. I mentioned some of these: FX-as-a-Service, risk as a service, chargeback automation, orchestration. All of these are things that we're now able to price to value, and monetize as part of a best-in-class unbranded offering.\nIn addition, though, we're really starting to differentiate ourselves in these conversations by being able to bring customers to the conversation. Again, as I sit down with CEOs of some of our largest customers and really talk about what are their greatest needs, it goes well beyond just processing.\nIt really goes to how do we bring more customers to bear. This is really the first time that we're leveraging the two-sided network that PayPal has and being able to say, hey, we have hundreds of millions of consumers around the world. We now have an ads platform, we have reward platforms, we have the ability to enable our unbranded processing customers to create rewards and offers inside of our PayPal app to be able to drive additional growth for them.\nThese become really fun conversations, to be honest, because we're now having holistic, not just processing, but end-to-end, how do we leverage their marketing dollars, how do we leverage their ability to acquire customers in our two-sided network.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. With respect to forward trends on this, we do expect similar dynamics the next few quarters, some volatility.\nI mean, this is not something that just happens in a perfect line, and we still do have some large agreements over the next couple of years that we will work our way through. The revenue growth should build as we lap some of these larger agreements sloughing off over time. For 2025, we expect the renegotiations to be about a five-point revenue growth headwind. The other important point here is that it's a one-point accretive on the TM dollars growth in 2025. I think an important dynamic there that, as you mentioned, we're very intentionally driving.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to the branded TPV topic. I think you mentioned US accelerated three points in the quarter.\nIf I caught that right, I guess that would imply international slowed. Perhaps you can quantify that and then maybe give us a sense of how that mid-single digit global branded volume outlook for 2025 splits between US and non-US, and just a little bit of color on how the transaction margin profile differs between US and international branded.\nThanks, guys.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nGood morning, Jason. With respect to international, we are still in a very strong market position there, and we continue to take share internationally. We had less than a full point of international pullback. Just some softness in Europe is what I would say. When you look at the split international to US, both in the TPV line and in the TM line, it's really 50/50. From a margin perspective, it's slightly healthier outside the US, but it's very much in line.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for the update. Just on growth and Venmo, can you just—I know you'll talk a lot about it on 25 February, but is it more about user growth, new products, or output from existing products expanding? Just curious what the algorithm is there. If you don't mind a quick clarification, the step-up in CapEx in 2025, is that more of a one-time issue? Is that a sustainable level to consider? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nHey, Tien-Tsin. Let me hit Venmo and then hand it over to Jamie. On Venmo, and again, it'll be exciting to see you all at Investor Day, and we'll certainly dive deep on Venmo. It is both customer growth, as well as monetization growth. Again, we are excited.\nVenmo is the number one P2P platform in the US. We saw MAAs continue to grow to 63 million by the end of this year. We're seeing TPV continue to grow, up 10%, hitting double digits really for the first time in, I think, seven, eight quarters, up to $76 billion. Really exciting to see the continuation of growth and active users. In terms of our focus on monetization, again, we've been consistent. This is about proven levers of debit card MAA growth, which was up 32%, and Pay with Venmo MAA growth, which was up 22%.\nThe reason this is important is we've seen that debit card MAA delivers average revenue per account 4x when they adopt our debit card, and Pay with Venmo, average revenue per account is up 3x.\nJust as a reminder, we are in single-digit penetration across both of those products across the base. As we continue to grow customers, we're growing active customers, and we're starting to grow penetration of monetizable elements. This is exciting for us. We also will just continue to focus on innovation. I think we're just scratching the surface of a very engaged, highly valuable demographic. We've rolled out new innovations like scheduled send, gifting, groups, and direct deposits to bring more money into the ecosystem. The team has a really, really exciting roadmap for 2025 as we start to really think about what are the other needs once this money is in the ecosystem of Venmo.\nWhat are the other needs that our customers have to be able to enable them to be able to spend in an omnichannel way and obviously move money across each other? Exciting about what Venmo will have. We've built a very good baseline of monetization throughout 2024, which sets us up well for 2025.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nGood. With respect to CapEx, we're seeing over the next two years an increase in the program to about $200 to 300 million. It relates to tech infra buildout and data center buildout in connection with both platform consolidation and a few other things. After the two years, it should come down.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolf Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Jamie, I think you said you'd expect stable branded growth through 2025 based on what's built into your outlook.\nYou guys have initiatives now where 25% of your checkout experience is on the more modern checkout, which I know has kind of ramped through the end of last year. We're there now, and it should impact, I think. The debit card is more further out. Marketing has been more substantial. I guess I'm just curious when those initiatives you think would have a more immaterial impact, or are they embedded in your outlook that they could have an impact on branded acceleration as the year progresses? Are you just building in uncertainty around things like international, maybe Germany, or any other softness?\nOne quick follow-on would be the exit rate of transaction margin growth exploit was, I think, 6% in the context of this 6% branded.\nI'm just curious, when you think of your forecast, is there anything about this Q4 growth rate that was unsustainable other than maybe leap year? Otherwise, you're 5%. I think you've added 5% plus, so it may capture that. Thanks, guys.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. First, let's talk about the branded checkout growth in 2025. You were specifically asking about initiatives. As Alex mentioned, we've got 25% of our US TPV flowing through the most modern checkout experiences at this point. That is something that we expect to scale as we get into 2025. In addition, we're going global with that as well. To your point, we do expect some impact from that to start to flow through. We have embedded some of that in our guide, and we expect it to build over time. Having said that, we also think we've prudently planned here.\nI wouldn't say we've explicitly put an overlay for European softness in there. Having said that, we've left ourselves room to navigate different things because as we roll this out, the impact of how this will flow through may be uneven as we see it. Darrin, remind me of your second question. It was on TM, but I didn't pick up the exact question you were asking.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGrowth rate, you're at 6% already without any acceleration or any of the underlying KPIs despite all the initiatives you've done. You're guiding 5% plus, I guess 5% plus, right, from a non-float impacted. Just making sure there's nothing unsustainable in Q4's exit rate that should inform you on 2025's growth.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. When you look at 2025, from a TM perspective, there's probably two things to think about that are headwinds to 2025 TM.\nThe first is we expect transaction loss to normalize as we get into the year. We had a full point benefit of that in 2024, a full basis point benefit. When we get into 2025, we expect about a half a basis point headwind. Really, we are growing products that just carry with it a higher transaction loss rate. You mentioned the 6%. I would talk a little bit around interest rates. When you look at total all-in TM, we're expecting about a $150 million interest rate headwind on all-in TM there too. When you look at the underlying profile of TM, which really revolved around branded checkout, Braintree, Venmo, credit, I mean, all of those things are things that we believe are durable.\nIt's clearly diverse, and things that we fully expect to continue as we get into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nDarrin, I want to pile on to Jamie's comments as well because I think it's really important to set our branded checkout strategy in context. First, as Jamie said, and I think we've been consistent throughout the year, we're excited about the innovations. I think we've been pretty prudent in the way that we have looked at a forward guide. We want to see the results before we tell you they're coming. If I just step back and think about the strategy, think about what we did in 2024, we really worked on innovation and what I would call just fixing the basics of branded checkout, as I described earlier, an improved product now in the hands of customers on both desktop and mobile.\nWe're now starting to see that scale, as you mentioned, up to 25%, and we'll continue to scale that throughout the quarter and the rest of 2025. We've expanded to guest checkout, which we weren't playing in before. Now we're starting to bring in new users through our FastLane product, which, again, needs to continue to scale and will scale over the next few years. We now have innovation in market that is best in class to go after the guest checkout experience. We expanded to offline, so now we're playing in an omnichannel world where it's not just branded, but we're seeing offline commerce that we didn't see before, and it's driving habituation.\nOur debit card users are transacting twice as much as just a branded user, and driving 20% higher average revenue per active.\nWe're just starting to put together a holistic strategy here that's beyond just a single button experience, but really starting to engage our growing customer base, our growing monthly active customer base, in a holistic way where we really can be their commerce partner going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with UBS.Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. In the past, when we talked about the mix within the branded checkout, we typically talked about it being very skewed to discretionary and to goods. In prior periods of strong discretionary growth during 2020, 2021, the branded checkout button grew in line, if not faster, depending on the metric or the industry data that you're looking at. The growth was better than industry.\nCould you maybe talk a little bit about how that mix might have evolved, if at all? If we were to expect a better period of discretionary spend, should we see another period of the branded checkout button growing in line, if not faster than the industry?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nGood morning, Tim. When you look at the composition of our verticals now, I would say that one of the things we've done a really nice job of in the last couple of years is really expanding to services. When you look at some of the dynamics that you might have seen three or four years ago, when you shift to now, we're just more balanced across different verticals. I mentioned some of the growth in a few of the areas, but services in particular is one that has been a larger space.\nI expect the dynamic to be more muted with respect to that discretionary side of it and the good side of it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up question on the US branded volume. I think, Alex, you mentioned that it exited the quarter at the high point. I mean, is there any color on sort of what that growth rate was and how it trended into this new year or quarter to date?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Really, the way I think about branded US is that we have been moving along, and we're obviously very focused on continuing to shift, continuing to impact our US market position. Alex talked about a lot of the innovation, specifically around mobile and around a couple of other areas that is really focused on driving shifting there.\nWe saw some lapping in the first part of the year, but as we hit Q3 and into Q4 in particular, that was pure growth off a base. That three points was reflective of that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks, and good morning. Maybe turning to the non-transaction expenses for the year, I was just hoping you could maybe expand on, first, I guess, the ability to use AI for more operating efficiency. Are those initiatives that are requiring some incremental investment near term, or are you already seeing sort of a positive ROI from that? Relatedly, with the focus on scaling innovations and educating consumers, I guess, what does that mean specifically in terms of the investments in customer acquisition and rewards that might be impacting operating margins through the year? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah.\nThank you, Colin. Let me start with AI and then maybe hand it over to Jamie. AI is opening up a huge opportunity for us. First, at our scale, we saw 26 billion transactions on our platform last year. We have a massive dataset that we are actively working and investing in to be able to drive our effectiveness and efficiency. Let me break it into a couple of different pieces. First, on the customer-facing side, we're leveraging AI to really become more efficient in our support cases and how we interact with our customers. We see tens of millions of support cases every year. We've rolled out our PayPal Assistant, which is now really cutting down phone calls and active events that we have.\nWe also are leveraging AI to personalize the commerce journey.\nWorking with our merchants to be able to understand and create this really magical experience for consumers when they show up at a checkout, it's not just a static button anymore. This really can become a dynamic, personalized button that starts to understand the profile of the consumer, the journey that they've been on, perhaps across merchants, and be able to enable a reward or a cashback offer in the moment or even a buy now, pay later offer in a dynamic experience. This is all AI-enabled and all things that will generate both efficiency for us from the consumer standpoint, but also drive more branded checkout and more sales for our merchants.\nIn addition, we also are looking at our back office and ensuring that not just on the engineering and employee productivity side, but also in things like our risk decisions.\nWe see billions and billions of risk decisions that, often, to be honest, were very manual in the past. We're now leveraging AI to be able to understand globally what are the nature of these risk decisions and how do we automate these across both risk models, as well as even just ensuring that customers get the right response at the right time in an automated fashion.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. With respect to scaling consumer and non-transaction OpEx, we increased our marketing spend in 2024 by about $250 million. We were very focused around really reinvigorating the brand, and then really reinforcing the consumer value prop as we did it. As we get into 2025, we will be increasing marketing slightly. Our total opex guide is up low single digits.\nI would say marketing is up low single digits plus in terms of how we look at it, heavily weighted towards the Q2 as we really look at the profile throughout the year. It's been very targeted, and we've seen the results of that starting to come through with consumer MAAs up sequentially. We saw debit card MAAs up sequentially. We're seeing P2P improvements. There's been a nice kind of flow through of what we've seen. We've got some CAC, or Customer Acquisition Cost, budgeted for this year, but we really haven't started deploying that yet. We've been testing that, but the full suite will be things that we'll be looking to deploy as we get into 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Good morning. I want to follow up on FastLane.\nYou talked about the new merchant wins. Now that the holiday season is over and the merchants are more open to integrating new solutions, how are those conversations going with large merchants, especially because there's also some competitive dynamics there? Alex, you also talked about 75% of FastLane consumers kind of being new or dormant PayPal users. Can you just remind us about how you're converting those into PayPal users? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Thanks, Harshita. You're exactly right. Guest checkout, just as a reminder for FastLane, this is really six months in the market. It's still brand new. There are other guest checkout experiences that have been in the market, some for many years, one almost up to a decade. We're the new entrant, but we're delivering the best converting experience for our merchants.\nThat's what gets us really excited, is as we start to scale our FastLane experience, we are still continuing to deliver double-digit lift in conversion for our merchants. Our focus, our go-to-market focus, has been really on those enterprise merchants, on the largest ones. I mentioned a few on the call: NBCUniversal, Roku, StockX. This has obviously set up conversations throughout the holiday season as many of them were not ready to actually do the integration. Now, as we get into 2025, it's full steam ahead. Just as a reminder, as we have these conversations, they are very excited about the conversion uplift.\nGuest checkout is also not something that they've spent a lot of time playing around with.It's not like these merchants have scrum teams sitting there ready to play around with guest checkout. They're working on their roadmaps.\nThe conversations have been great. It's now about getting implementation done. I do think this will take a number of quarters for us to really scale this out across the merchant base. The conversations are exciting. Merchants are on board, and I think we'll continue to see this scale. To your question on what we're seeing from a customer perspective, again, 25% of FastLane users that are coming in are new to PayPal. 50% were dormant in the last 12 months. Again, these are customers that are opting into FastLane at a 45% clip. We're continuing to see customers choosing to, once they go into that guest checkout experience, actually opt in to the FastLane experience.\nTo us, this is just scratching the surface of being able to now reinvigorate them. We've started to really ramp up our marketing efforts.\nIt's still early, and it's through both offline channels, things like email, testing notifications, as well as online through the app, to find incentives and reasons for these consumers to be able to reengage in the PayPal experience. The good news is it's sort of a second bite at the apple, right? They've gone past the branded experience. They've gone through a guest checkout experience. We've accelerated it for them and for merchants. We've created that conversion, and now we can go and remind those consumers what a great experience, a cashback offer, a package tracking offer, a full end-to-end experience they could have gotten through a branded checkout.\nWe're going to continue to lean into that to reignite those users into being more consistent, active users on PayPal.\nThe last thing just that I'd say as context is our PayPal users that are online don't use PayPal for every single one of their purchases. This is why the omnichannel habituation and just continuing to drive up not just our MAAs, but those power users that I talked about that are really using us for all of their purchases is so important to us, because we still have users that love PayPal, have an active app, use us, but still use us for just a fraction. Our ability, even through the FastLane experience, to gather those users up and remind them of the benefits of actually going through the branded experience of PayPal is so important and will ultimately drive to our branded checkout growth.\nSarah, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies.\nYour line is open.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director of FinTech Equity Research, Jefferies",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back to Venmo. Jamie, it sounded like next to branded, it was one of the biggest contributors to transaction margin dollar growth in Q4. You guys are giving some good stats on attach rate and user growth across the different buckets. It'd be helpful if we could get an updated transaction margin dollar number for Venmo and then anything more just on the current mix of revenue across the different buckets: debit card, pay with Venmo, instant transfer, and just how you're thinking about Venmo's contribution to transaction margin dollar growth in 2025. Thanks.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Venmo has been a growing contributor to transaction margin dollar growth. Certainly in 2024, it was behind interest, branded checkout, Braintree, etc.\nAs we get into 2025, it continues to grow in terms of its impact on TM, which is really great to see. When you look at our Venmo TPV, it was up 10% in the Q4. Our debit card TPV was up 40%. Pay with Venmo was up 50%. P2P was up 8%. We're really excited about not only the core P2P continued strength, but also just the beginnings of the investments. We're making a debit and pay with Venmo, which when we really dig into this, which is really our new Venmo leaders' target in 2025, we're excited about the growth we can drive. When we get to Investor Day at the end of February, we'll unpack this with a lot more detail, and we're looking forward to talking to you all there.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nAlex, any final thoughts?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nCEO, PayPal\n\nNope.\nJust a huge thank you to all of you, and thanks, Steve. Look forward to seeing many of you later this month at our Investor Day on 25 February, where we will share our vision for the future and dive into our strategies for medium and long-term growth and what it's going to take to get us there. Take care, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by President and CEO Alex Chriss, and CFO Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today, as described in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and on our website. Those elements may change as the world changes. Now, over to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal delivered a strong second quarter and first half, with encouraging operating and financial results. While change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well-positioned today, have the right leadership in place, and are moving full steam ahead. I'm confident we are on the right track and making meaningful progress on our transformation to position PayPal for long-term, durable, and profitable growth. Looking at our results in the second quarter, total payment volume rose 11% to $417 billion, and we delivered 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8%, representing our best performance on that metric since 2021. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 36% year-over-year.\nWe're encouraged to see not only the strength and stability in PayPal's platform, but also early contributions from some of the initiatives we have underway. Branded Checkout continues to grow profitably. Braintree is now meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth for the first time in over two years. Venmo momentum continues to build, and monthly active accounts increased across both PayPal and Venmo. Given the strength across PayPal, we are raising our full-year guidance for growth in transaction margin dollars and earnings per share, and increasing our investment in strategic growth initiatives that we are driving overall. We remain on course with the strategy we set at the beginning of the year. Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation, and focused on execution.\nWe are still early in our transformation, and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do, and with greater speed. For example, mobile experiences, SMB, and Venmo are places we are working hard to improve, and we are continuing to identify ways to operate more effectively and efficiently. I want to spend a moment discussing how PayPal stands apart as a strategic commerce partner. In the past two quarters, we have talked at length about the experience upgrades we are bringing to Branded Checkout. However, I do not want to lose sight of what makes PayPal truly differentiated, our two-sided network of hundreds of millions of consumers and merchants worldwide. We are building an end-to-end platform spanning the full commerce journey, with superior customer experiences in sales conversion from start to finish.\nPayPal is one of the only players with both sides of the network, consumer and merchant, at scale globally, and with the infrastructure to support it that is incredibly hard to replicate and a powerful foundation on which to launch new innovations, including Fastlane and the Ads Platform that we are in the early stages of building. The data insights and compounding network effects give us an incredible advantage that we are now just beginning to harness fully. Today we operate in a massive $6 trillion plus global e-commerce market that benefits from the ongoing digitization of payments and commerce in new contexts. These tailwinds, combined with the initiatives we are now executing, such as building more omnichannel capabilities and offering more value-added services for consumers and merchants, will expand our addressable market and provide PayPal with significant opportunity for long-term growth.\nOver the last year, we have been working to transform our global business from a series of products and services into a multifaceted, omnichannel, and open platform capable of generating value in multiple ways throughout the commerce ecosystem. We are building a platform that delivers far more value to our customers and partners than the individual products we offer. This is a key differentiator for PayPal and will expand our market opportunity over time. The initial response to the innovations we are introducing gives us confidence that we will see more consumers and more engagement in more places across our growing network. That in turn will drive more merchants and higher levels of commitment into our ecosystem. These network effects will be mutually reinforcing, compounding, and add value to the company.\nOur peers are taking note, and the value of our platform is being recognized by large tech companies that are seeking to partner with us in a variety of new ways. One great example of this is Meta, which we already partner with on multiple fronts. PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across Meta's family of apps. Meta's donations and charitable giving campaigns now run on the PayPal Giving Fund platform. Meta pays out creators and developers using Hyperwallet, and Meta uses Braintree for credit card processing. We are working closely with Meta to optimize the experiences, and look forward to deepening our partnership with Meta in mutually beneficial ways in the months and years ahead. You will continue to hear about more partnerships with deepening commitments over the coming quarters. Let me update you on our customer-backed business strategies.\nWe continue to execute with high velocity to enhance customer experiences and value for our large enterprises, SMBs, and consumers. We are building the foundation for our next phase of growth for large enterprises. We continue to have a productive conversation to help merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us to take advantage of our full platform capabilities. For example, we recently renewed our contract with DoorDash to expand how we work together beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks. DoorDash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses. As part of our new agreement, DoorDash has committed as an initial launch partner for our latest branded checkout enhancements that we announced in January, and they will be participating in our new Ads Platform.\nCombining our best-in-class payments platform with value-added services that are margin accretive is helping us create a more profitable dynamic. Last quarter I told you we expected to make Fastlane generally available in the US in the second half of the year. I'm pleased to announce that in August we are delivering on that commitment and making Fastlane generally available to merchants in the US. This includes merchants on Braintree and PPCP, as well as through partners including Salesforce, Adobe, and BigCommerce. While broad adoption will take time, we have heard from many merchants who are excited to add Fastlane and have a robust go-to-market strategy. As I've shared before, data from our early adopters shows that returning Fastlane users convert at nearly 80% versus the industry average guest checkout conversion closer to 50%.\nAs our network builds with more merchants and consumers, we expect benefits to scale over time because we will be able to recognize even more shoppers. The early feedback we've heard from our merchants and sales team gives us increasing confidence that Fastlane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture the roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded mark. As a reminder, a large part of that 60% is still manual card entry, has low conversion today, and is generally a poor experience for consumers and merchants. Much of that is now changing with Fastlane for small and medium-sized businesses. We are continuing to improve our value proposition through the rollout of PPCP. We continue to make progress migrating volume from legacy platforms onto this new solution, as well as integrating with new partners and merchants.\nSMB volume on PPCP continues to trend positively, up more than 40% through the first half of the year. A large portion of that volume is coming from merchants using PayPal as their full stack processor across both branded and unbranded payments. Our efforts here are also important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest branded checkout integration, which will include Fastlane, that will give consumers a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop and help merchants benefit from higher conversion. On average, merchants who adopt PPCP use more products, which deepens our relationship, reduces churn, and drives higher average revenue per account. As I said before, this is an area where we are focused, and we have tremendous opportunity to better serve small businesses' end-to-end needs for consumers.\nWe are focused on extending our leadership in consumer preference, increasing the share of checkout, and driving more frequent engagement from our consumers. In the second quarter, we launched in-app offers with major brands including Best Buy, Priceline, Lyft, Instacart, Ticketmaster, Walmart, and Nordstrom. We are seeing positive trends in consumer engagement, with gross merchandise volume driven by one of our offers nearly tripling in June compared to March, and while still early days, the initial interest from advertisers is encouraging. As we've shared before, you will see us invest in marketing in the back half of the year and beyond to further position PayPal and Venmo as rewarding ways to pay. I talked previously about our need to improve our branded checkout experiences on mobile devices. That improvement is now happening.\nIn the first half, we started ramping several designs and technology innovations to our branded checkout flows to improve the experience for our customers. For example, we are launching a new super simple vaulted experience for high repeat use merchants. In initial tests, the redesigned vaulting payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 110 basis points. Experiences like this one are clearly resonating with consumers, and remember that every point of conversion lift drives significant value for our merchants who are fighting to win every sale. We will be ramping our redesigned branded checkout experiences to all eligible consumers in the US in the coming weeks and months. As the number one branded mark with the largest network of merchant acceptance, we are a ubiquitous checkout solution. We are continuing to innovate and create high converting experiences on both desktop and mobile, and across platforms and devices.\nWe also continue engaging consumers post purchase with Smart Receipts, package tracking, push notifications, and more, adding increased value and driving the PayPal engagement flywheel. In fact, we drove almost 20 million app logins from our post purchase experiences in June alone, growing more than 70% from a year ago. P2P is an essential acquisition and engagement tool for us, and we are returning it to growth. We suffered declines through 2023, but over the past few quarters we have seen an improvement driven by product enhancements such as new global withdrawal capabilities, better risk decisioning, and more cross border activity. We will continue to invest in our experiences, pricing, and marketing to drive enhanced awareness and engagement. Turning to Venmo, we are building on the business's strong market position.\nIn the second quarter, Venmo processed more than $73 billion in total payment volume, growing 8% year-over-year, with monthly actives increasing 5% year-over-year to nearly $62 million. Both a strong base of peer to peer users and adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth. For example, both Venmo Debit Card and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew approximately 30% in the second quarter. We launched push provisioning of the Venmo Debit Card to Apple and Google Wallets, and continued to enable Pay with Venmo with more merchants and partners, including eBay and StubHub, which we expect will continue to fuel this growth. Our recently launched Venmo Teen Accounts is showing encouraging early traction, expanding our addressable market, and helping us build lifelong relationships with customers from an early age.\nWhat excites me most about Venmo is that we are only scratching the surface of its potential, starting to drive customer-led profitable innovation, and we see substantial headroom for growth. Said simply, Venmo is primed for growth. Finally, consumers who love PayPal for online purchases are also telling merchants they want to use PayPal for their offline purchases. We continue to drive the adoption of our card products, and we're making it easier to add PayPal and Venmo branded cards to Apple and Google Wallets on mobile devices. We are also looking forward to launching even more ways for consumers to use PayPal anytime, any place, with NFC technology starting in Europe. Expect to see more from us in the coming quarters to enable and incentivize our customers to use PayPal online and in person.\nReflecting on the quarter and looking ahead, I want to thank the PayPal team for continuing to work tirelessly as we transform our company and give our customers the best possible experiences. With that, over to Jamie.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Alex. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 6, PayPal delivered strong second quarter results, and we are raising our full year guidance. We're passing through the first half performance and increasing second half growth investments as we build confidence in initiatives across the company. Our goal for 2024 remains the same: to set PayPal up for long term success by prioritizing investments that will deliver durable, profitable growth. As Alex mentioned, while the second quarter produced another improving set of results, change takes time and can sometimes be uneven. The success of our transformation will be measured over quarters and years. We have a lot of work ahead, but the teams are making progress and building on a strong foundation visible in our first half results. Looking at the high level financial results in the second quarter, revenue increased 8% at spot and 9% on a currency neutral basis.\nTransaction margin dollars grew 8% year-over-year, a more than 300 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19, representing 36% year-over-year growth, and relative to our prior expectations, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including stronger transaction margin, dollar growth, and interest income. Turning to Slide 7, our financial results are a function of the number of customers we have, how engaged they are across our platform, and how frequently they transact with us. Our operating metrics reflect progress on this front. We ended the second quarter with 429 million total active accounts and 222 million monthly active accounts. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the first quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts, in addition to other products.\nWe were encouraged to see sustained total active account growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 3% year-over-year to 222 million, with contributions from both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing twelve month number, was 60.9 in the second quarter, up 11% excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree. Transactions per active account grew 6%. Moving to slide 8, total payment volume grew 11% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $417 billion. US TPV grew 11%. International TPV also grew 11% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in continental Europe and Asia. Looking at the breakdown by product, global branded checkout volumes grew 6% on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter.\nThis was consistent with our first quarter performance, which increased 6%, excluding a 1 point benefit from the additional leap day within Branded Checkout. We continue to see strength across large enterprise platforms, marketplaces, and international growth. We remain laser focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small and medium businesses, and improving our mobile experiences, which are critical, particularly in markets like the US and the UK. PSP processing volume grew 19% in the quarter compared to 26% in the first quarter. Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefit of our shift in strategy to drive profitable growth. Our focus on price to value is having an impact, with Braintree now contributing positively to transaction margin dollar growth in a meaningful way.\nMoving to more financial detail on Slide 9, transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.2 billion, driven primarily by Braintree, Branded Checkout, and Venmo, other value added services. Revenue in the quarter was close to flat at $732 million. Interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind to OVAS revenue and contributed approximately 3 points to transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. Revenue within our credit business declined year-over-year but performed in line with expectations. Part of the decline is due to proactive decisions made last year to manage risk and reduce on balance sheet merchant receivables. We are also seeing ongoing normalization of loss rates within our off balance sheet US consumer revolving portfolio.\nOverall, we have taken steps over the last year to actively manage the credit portfolio's exposure and are continuing to position the portfolio to move toward a less capital intensive business model. Transaction take rate declined by 3 basis points to 1.72% compared to a 5 basis point decline last quarter. PSP volumes and Venmo benefited transaction take rate, which was offset by faster large enterprise growth within our Branded Checkout business, foreign exchange fees, and an acceleration in other merchant services including payouts. Transaction margin dollars increased 8% in the second quarter compared to a 4% increase in the first quarter. Higher interest on customer balances, Branded Checkout, Braintree, and Venmo were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. Branded Checkout and Venmo's strong transaction margin results benefited from ongoing efforts to improve and optimize transaction loss performance, as well as some transaction expense favorability.\nWhile it's still early, we are encouraged to see initial actions related to price to value, as well as product and ongoing risk enhancements, make a positive impact. Relative to last quarter, we saw Braintree return to profitable growth and improvements in the contribution from Venmo branded checkout and P2P. Non-transaction related operating expenses declined 1% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 24% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.5%, benefiting from expense leverage and improvement in transaction margin trends. PayPal generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5 billion.\nFinally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of more than $18 billion and debt of just over $12 billion. Moving to guidance on Slide 10 for the third quarter and the full year in 2024, for the remainder of the year, we continue to guide assuming a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid single digits, and non-GAAP EPS to grow by high single digits. We are raising our guidance for the full year and now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow in the low to mid teens. This increase reflects outperformance in the second quarter, as well as a slightly more positive view of the second half of the year.\nWith some strategic reinvestment into growth initiatives underpinning our guidance, we now expect transaction margin dollars to increase by a low to mid single-digit percentage for the full year. We have seen steady, profitable growth from our branded checkout business and feel confident in the progress our teams are making. It is encouraging to see the initial impact of our initiatives related to price to value, as well as ongoing product enhancements in areas like P2P. Some of our efforts, particularly on the innovation side, are still early and will take time to scale, but we're encouraged by the initial results and customer response as we begin moving from the test and pilot phases into launch. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to continue to make progress on these fronts, but there are a few factors to keep in mind.\nConsistent with the strategy we laid out in prior quarters, our teams continue to prioritize high quality, profitable growth as we execute against our long term roadmap. Related to this, we expect lower volume and revenue growth as we move through the second half of the year. This is deliberate, and it shows good progress. By strategically focusing on price to value in areas like large enterprise processing within Braintree, we are driving transaction margin dollar improvements even on a lower volume growth. Offsetting some of these improvements, we expect a much smaller tailwind from growth in interest on customer balances, which represented an approximately 3% tailwind to transaction margin dollar growth in the first half. We are also planning prudently and forecasting less favorability with some normalization in transaction and credit losses.\nWe continue to expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly, with ongoing efficiency funding our strategic growth investments. Our investment spending will ramp as the year progresses to support our highest priority growth initiatives, the go-to-market of new products, partnerships, and innovation, as well as reinvigorated marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo. These investments are all in support of reaccelerating durable, profitable growth for the company. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 free cash flow guidance to approximately $6 billion. We are also increasing our share buyback plan to $6 billion, compared to our prior guidance for at least $5 billion. In closing, we've been making good progress throughout the first half of 2024 as we drive significant change across the company.\nWe have clear opportunities to lean in further and ensure we stay on offense in what remains a competitive and dynamic environment. We're excited about the path forward, and look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, back to you, Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nThank you, Jamie. To summarize, PayPal grew profitably again, with strength in multiple areas, including Branded, Unbranded, and Venmo. We are also starting to see traction in several initiatives. Taken together, these results highlight the strength of PayPal's global commerce platform. I'll leave you with one last example. You've heard me talk about our Venmo customers looking for us to provide more money in and money out opportunities. As we are improving opportunities to spend Venmo balance with products like Venmo Debit Card or Pay with Venmo, we are seeing a corresponding improvement in funds being used within the Venmo ecosystem rather than transferred out. This is an example of meeting our customers where they are, solving their needs, and driving monetization and margin improvement in the process.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter for PayPal, and it gives us the confidence to both increase our growth investments and raise our full year profit and free cash flow guide. I'm proud of our team and excited about the coming quarters and years for PayPal. Steve, let's go to Q&A.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nThanks, Alex. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Sarah, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks so much for taking my question, and great to see all the progress that you're making. Branded volumes maintain the X leap year growth rate from last quarter. Can you drill down a bit more into your strategy to drive branded growth acceleration? You mentioned a focus on mobile vaulting user interface. What are the most important levers? Maybe also, did Jamie's comments on lower volumes right there at the end of the prepared remarks and the second half apply to both branded and unbranded volumes? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Ramsey. You know we're excited to see the progress that we've made on branded. As you can see, we've got a consistent, loyal customer base that continues to use and love PayPal. What we've been focused on over the last six months is really some of the things I've touched on before, the experiences, particularly around mobile. I touched on some of it in the comments, but the teams are working night and day now to improve everything from the vaulted experience, which is essential on mobile. This is, think of high usage, high repeat usage checkout experience where you actually vault PayPal as your default. We've now improved that experience, and as I mentioned, we're seeing a 75 to 110 basis point lift with our new experience.\nWe're also rolling out a new paysheet experience overall, which simplifies, gives customers still the choice of whether they're using PayPal, Balance, or any instrument they want, as well as buy now, pay later. Just simplifying the experience, and we're seeing a nice little lift in conversion rate there as well. Big focus on the end-to-end customer experience. We feel like that, combined with the ubiquity that we have just in marks across both mobile and web, gives us the ability to continue to not only maintain but where we want to be, which is taking share in the branded experience.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nGreat. Ramsey, on the second part of your question about lower volumes in the second half, that primarily relates to Braintree. We are seeing both lapping of larger wins this year, particularly in the second half, and some shifting in normalization in the Braintree revenue profile, just as we enter into and really get into the process of working with our customers around our mission around profitable growth. On the branded checkout side of things, we expect the second half to be consistent with the first. July is off to a good start. What we've seen in July is very consistent with the first half so far, so we feel pretty good about that.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks and nice results, especially on the transaction margin side. Start there and touch on the dynamics around what's contributing to it from mix versus. You talked a lot about pricing for value, which we've heard more and more about in the industry also. It's good to see, but maybe more direction and color on this contributing forces and adding onto that the sustainability of the strength you saw this quarter and growing transaction margin dollars at these rates. Help us understand your expectations there going forward. Now obviously you updated guidance, but really beyond just the next few months. Thanks guys.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah, good morning, Darrin. Thank you. Maybe I'll start with the biggest contributors to transaction margin dollar growth and talk a little bit about the second half there as well. We were really excited to see the broad-based strength and the acceleration. You know, there's a lot the team has underway, and there's several significant contributors to the growth. You know, first, we talked about in my prepared remarks interest income on customer balances. That was about 3 points in the first half. Second, and really very strong, was branded checkout. It continues to grow profitably. It's a healthy contributor to transaction margin dollar growth. Braintree, which you mentioned, is back to contributing to transaction margin dollar growth, which we're really excited about. It's really great to see some progress from our shift in focus there.\nVenmo continues to benefit not only from the strong consumer, but we're doing a nice job in Venmo too, driving continued growth in monthly actives. Lastly, transaction loss favorability continued to be favorable in the second quarter as well, which was nice to see. You know, when we think about the second half, there's really a couple of things to think about there. I'd say first is that our first half tailwind around interest income, you know, will begin to decline. We've just got higher comps in H2 2023 as rates were coming up in the second half of last year. That impact on transaction margin dollar growth, the percentage, that'll start to come down. The second is that we saw transaction loss favorability in both the first quarter and the second quarter. It is feeling more durable than we expected even in the first quarter.\nHaving said that, we're planning for some normalization in the second half as we get better in transaction loss prevention and detection. So do bad actors, and they continue to work hard to do different things. The second is we are launching a number of products in the second half, and anytime you launch products, we're just being prudent around how we think about transaction loss to make sure that if we have a few bugs in the process, we're working the kinks out as we go. The core business is solid. We are more positive than we were three months ago on Braintree profitability, P2P on transaction loss. It's still early in our progress, but we're driving significant changes.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Chen with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTim Chen\n\nPayments Business Manager, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks. Good results here. I want to ask about the second half growth investments. It looks like in your guidance you're implying a fourth quarter step down in EPS performance there. Does that, should we assume that that's heavy marketing around the holiday? Can you maybe just give a little more specifics on what you're marketing exactly, and what kind of return you're expecting? Thanks.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nHi, Tim Chen. Good morning. I'll take the first part, and then maybe Alex will want to comment on the marketing pieces of it. In the first half, we've done, I think, a really nice job with expense discipline. We've taken a number of actions to reduce our OpEx profile while at the same time remixing or prioritizing investment back into engineering, production, and some marketing. We intentionally deferred in the first half some marketing dollars to the second half. When you look at the second half profile, you're seeing the same underlying core reinvestment in engineering, go to market, and things like that.\nYou're also seeing a much bigger ramp in our marketing spend around marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo, but really also around these product launches, really making sure we put our marketing dollars to work to have that hit the ground running the way we need to. In the second half, when you think about the EPS guide side of it, more than half of that Q4 pressure is the ramping of those growth investments. The other side, I'll just mention this quickly while we're on the topic, is that we've got a higher tax rate in the second half than we had in the first half, and so that, particularly on a comparative basis to last year, is what's impacting some of the EPS profile.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, just to pile on and dig a little bit deeper, you know, we, this is very deliberate. The first half of the year we needed to invest in innovation, invest in the customer experiences, and put to market experiences on both PayPal and Venmo from a consumer standpoint that we can be proud of. I feel like we're at that place now. The experience on the PayPal app, what we're putting out on branded experiences, and even just the engagements, just the new designs, the shopping, and rewards that now exist inside of the PayPal app is completely rebuilt and new. On the Venmo side, you've seen the improvement as we started to create real onboarding ramps for our debit card, and we're seeing the improvement there.\nFeeling really good about the experiences on both of the apps, and it's time to tell the world about it. We're excited to ramp up some of our go to market spending in exciting and engaging ways.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning, Alex. I want to ask about Europe. Historically, PayPal has grown in the region despite not investing enough. How are you thinking about Europe among PayPal's international markets? Looks like the company has a very strong local presence, and the regulatory environment is now more favorable with respect to NFC access and icons. Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nI think it's a great question, and it's one of the things that we may overlook sometimes when we just think about PayPal. We are a global company, and the way customers use us, whether it be cross border or access to merchants all over the world, is truly a global phenomenon. We've invested heavily over the years in ensuring that we are compliant everywhere that we want to be, in over 200 different markets. As we think about our strategy, as I've laid out in the past, to make sure that PayPal is available everywhere for every purchase, every time, that includes being able to be available in an omnichannel solution, whether it's e-commerce or whether it's in person.\nWith some of the changes coming, particularly in Europe around NFC, that opens up the opportunity for us, and we will be prepared shortly to be able to play in that space. It's exciting to see our growth. I'll hit one more example, our Buy Now Pay Later growth that we continue to see. 60% of that volume comes from outside of the US, so we're bringing the entire ecosystem of what PayPal brings to the global stage, and excited to continue to invest there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning to everybody. Was curious on the SMB initiatives. In particular, the strategy to drive more adoption or brand at checkout, how important Fastlane is to that initiative, and then also if you think advertising can be ultimately a lever for that side of the business as well on both sides of the network. Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, that's a great question. SMB, as I've said since I got here, I think is an untapped opportunity for us. Let's just pull back and talk about what SMBs really need. Small businesses are there fighting for every customer. They need to be able to find customers, engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them. Really, what they're looking for is an end-to-end platform and an end-to-end solution to help them. It is very difficult for a small business to piece together 17 different solutions. They just don't have the bandwidth, the people, and the time to be able to make that happen. With PPCP, we now have put together the most powerful single platform for them to be able to run their business in a full stack manner.\nWith PPCP, you now get branded experiences. With the best branded experiences, you get access to the best guest checkout conversion. With Fastlane, you get unbranded processing so that you can ensure that you can process anywhere around the world. You get every mark, you get Buy Now Pay Later, you get access to our working capital. As you mentioned, now that we start to roll out our Ads Platform, you get the ability to drive new customers. You also get the ability to re-engage with customers in a delightful way. Package tracking, Smart Receipts, the ability to be able to remarket to customers even after they purchased—all of this is in one place with one partner. We're in early days. Right now, PPCP really is just rolling out.\nWe're excited about the progress and the growth, but there's a lot more to play here. Live in 30 markets and through 40 partner channels. I think we're just getting started. This is going to play out over the next few years.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nGood morning. It's nice to hear about the accelerated general availability of Fastlane. Maybe you could talk about what it means from a revenue contribution standpoint, and if not this year, maybe we could just talk about how we should think about the revenue contribution. Would it be through more engagement? Secondly, if you could just talk about the volume trend, it seemed like US was pretty stable. International dropped off. Maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Let me start with Fastlane. Just as a reminder for everyone, Fastlane is really tackling the 60% of checkout that is guest checkout. We've got a unique experience because of the volume of our two-sided network and the consumers that we see coming in, where we're able to dramatically change the conversion rate for repeat users. So, 80% conversion rate versus, you know, a traditional, roughly 50% on a repeat user. Our goal is to capture and help all merchants for all guest checkouts. The way we built Fastlane is this really is a platform that can be processor agnostic, and we want to be able to help every consumer come through and have a delightful guest checkout experience, as well as enable actually our ability to capture them through a Fastlane by PayPal experience and bring them into a branded experience as well.\nThere's a flywheel effect in terms of rollout. We're rolling this out now. We've got a developer day situated in a few weeks from this time in August. We're going GA now in August as well. We'll be ramping up as many customers as we can. We've not talked about and disclosed pricing on this, so I'm not going to get into that at this point. Know that this is our ability to monetize not just guest checkout that we process through Braintree, but really for us the total addressable market is the entire guest checkout experience across the board.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. On the second part of your question, around the US and international environments, you know, as I mentioned before, we see the US environment being very consistent right now with what we've seen over the first half. International is a real strength for us, and we did have a shift down a bit in the international area on TPV this quarter. When you look at that, what that really is, it's almost solely related to lapping some large Braintree wins last year. Otherwise, very healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nDan Dolev\n\nManaging Director and Senior Fintech Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thank you for letting me ask a question. You know, great results. Wanted to ask you, Alex, a little bit about the competitive positioning regarding, you know, Apple Pay. Obviously really strong branded checkout. There have been some worries in the past. Can you maybe contextualize a little bit where we are and, you know, what you're doing to beat them? Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, thanks Dan. Great question. Let me set some context. First, we play in a massive multi-trillion dollar market, and it's not a zero-sum game. We expect competitors. We've had competitors come in since we launched over a decade ago. We went from one button to now there's lots of different buttons and branded experiences, and we'll expect that to continue. Let me just set the context of the reality of today and then how we think about the future. The reality today is we are the number one branded experience across all platforms and devices. If we narrow down into desktop web, which is still 40%-50% of all checkout, we see no degradation in our share over the past four years. Let me say that again, we've held share despite competition.\nSecond, if we look across browsers, there's actually no difference in our selection rate across different browsers. Certain buttons moving from one platform to the other just isn't material to us. That's where we are today. Let's focus around our ability to continue to improve and make this a better experience for our consumers going forward. For merchants, they're looking for an end-to-end solution. They want to get customers, they want to convert customers, and they want to engage and have a return experience with customers. As we talked about, we now have the best branded experience, we're continuing to improve that. We have Fastlane, we have the best checkout experience, and we've rolled out ads and are continuing to invest in our profile. We're helping merchants end to end. On the consumer side, they're looking for ubiquity, flexibility, and a rewarding experience.\nWe are the most ubiquitous. We have 80% acceptance rate in the developed world with a large and growing customer base. From a flexibility standpoint, they want to be able to pay everywhere with any way that they can that they want to pay, and we're able to provide that. If you pull back, I'm just excited that we are in a strong position of being the most complete platform and two-sided global network, driving the highest value and benefit to our consumers and our merchants.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS Financial. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director and Lead Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to drill into branded checkout a little bit. With the 6% growth, maybe you could talk a little bit about the relative levels of growth US versus international. Granted you did call out the strength in international with continental Europe and Asia, and then also on the relative levels of transaction margin in, given that there are some differences in transaction expense levels and also potentially merchant size. Mix would appreciate those, thanks.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah. On a relative level of growth, US and international both continue to be strong contributors for us. There's obviously different market mixes and different merchant mixes. As you look at those growth profiles in the US, large enterprises continue to be an area of strength for us, and I would say in the small business area, we continue to remix that portfolio as we move to PPCP and off of legacy platforms, and really move to both a direct and a partner strategy there. You know, when you look at the international side of things, branded checkout is very, very strong in several European countries and corridors. UK continues to be pressured. I would say outside of that, we've got real strength in other countries such as Germany, and just real bright spots in Europe as well.\nI'd say it's fairly balanced across the globe when you look at it. I'm trying to look at the second part of your question here. Transaction expense. When you look at transaction expense, it is impacted by funding mix, product mix, geo mix, all of that stuff. Funding mix, relatively stable. The biggest driver of our shift in TE right now has been Braintree, and that continues to be what is happening there. We're always looking at ways to continuously improve our transaction expense profile and work with different partners to move the needle on that. We continue to have different benefits, different quarters, just in terms of how that rolls through. None of which was particularly material, but we had a little bit of that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the full-year guide for the transaction profit dollar growth. Obviously, you're taking that up here. It does imply the deceleration in the second half that you've mentioned around flow comps, et cetera. What I'm trying to get a sense of is, has your full-year outlook for transaction profit dollar growth from the core branded and Braintree businesses changed, just to kind of isolate the delta here and the guidance?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal\n\nYeah, I would say generally we're seeing a stronger branded baseline, and we're having increasing confidence in the slope of our Braintree profitability efforts. That's what I would say on those two.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you so much. Want to circle back to Fastlane, and obviously a lot of interest and excitement in terms of its launch timing, et cetera. I think you've made it pretty clear that this will be kind of a gradual opportunity that will build on it in addressing a big market. How should we think about what your key to do's are as we go through the rest of this year and into next year? I'm wondering if any of Fastlane with the launch timing is now built into the guidance, as well as any other new initiatives that may have been added into guidance for the rest of the year. Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, let me start with the last part. We've really not built any Fastlane upside into guidance, and part of that is because our go to market is going to be very focused on just getting adoption, not around monetizing in this half of the year. Now, to be clear, we're pricing in the contracts that we're signing with customers, and so pricing is built in. As I said before, the TAM is every guest checkout. That's what our focus is. It's not built into the second half of the year. In terms of key to do's, we've really created and worked hard during this beta period to create a seamless experience so that developers and merchants can get on board as fast as possible.\nFor someone using us now, it's really a two to four week experience to get onto the Fastlane code and enable that to roll out. We need to get it on as many platforms as we can so that small businesses in particular can just one click a button and turn it on for the holidays. We're working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well. Again, the reality is we've got a lot of merchants around the world, and it's going to take time for them to be able to put this into their roadmap. That's why we want to set expectations that this is going to take quarters and years to get everyone on board. The beauty of Fastlane is it's a network effect, more customers coming through it.\nWe're already seeing best-in-class conversion rates. The more customers that come through it, the more profiles that we start to capture, and the better the conversion rates should become. We want to get started as fast as possible, get as many merchants through this holiday season as we can, and then build from there. Sarah, let's make time for one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey Alex and Jamie, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to double click just on the Braintree trends. Obviously good progress in terms of transaction margin, dollar growth. Maybe we could talk a little bit more about what's driving that. Clearly more discipline, lapping of large contracts. As we look to the back half and beyond, I hear you on the slope, that's kind of built into the outlook. From what you've seen so far, how does it inform your confidence in terms of building on the progress that you've seen so far in transaction margin dollar growth as we go into the back half and the subsequent years? Thanks a lot.\n\nJamie Miller",
    "content2": "CFO, PayPal\n\nGood morning, Andrew. Thank you. First, well, let's just talk through the Braintree growth and what's really driving that. We set out this year to really reorient the team with Braintree around profitable growth. As we've done that, we've had just a number of conversations with customers, both around contract renewal, but also just around our holistic relationship and really getting into understanding how we partner, what the margin structure is, how we provide value added services, just the overall value to value exchange that we've got. Honestly, they've been really positive conversations and just on a total relationship basis sort of thing. You know, as we looked at that, you know, there are certain situations where as we've gotten into the discussion, we're willing to accept a lower share of revenue in exchange for a higher margin contract.\nare other situations where as we work with our customers, we're able to sell in value added services in ways that we just haven't done before. It's lots of different levers in that process. What we're excited about is we're really starting to see good traction on that. It's intentional. We've set out to do this, and it's a really good thing for the business. I think as you look at the second half, what we saw play out in the second quarter, I expect to continue. We saw some of the volume growth normalize a bit, but we saw more positive transaction margin dollar growth. It's really good to see that tangible progress play out, and I think it will continue to play out over time.\nIt may be a little bit uneven and not linear, that trend of a little bit more normalization into the business, but improving margin profiles is something we fully expect to continue.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, PayPal\n\nAlex, I think you have time for any final comments you may have.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nThank you all today, and thanks, Steve. Just to close the call, company is energized. We're proud of what we've done, what we've accomplished. Just to again, sort of set the context of where we are. We're really six months in, we've got a new leadership team, we're getting stronger every day. We've returned the company to transaction margin growth, we've returned the company to consumer user growth, we significantly improved profitability of Braintree, and we're accelerating Venmo. I just feel really proud that we are stronger today than we were six months ago. We will be stronger six months from now than we are today. We're executing against our game plan. This will be measured in quarters and years. This will be a long game.\nSix months in, we are on the right trajectory. Thank you all for today, and see you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings earnings conference call for the first quarter 2024. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star one again. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ryan Wallace, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Wallace\n\nHead of Investor Relations, PayPal Holdings\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining PayPal's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Alex Chriss, our President and CEO, and Jamie Miller, our CFO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast. Both the presentation and call are available on our investor relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.\nOur remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.\nYou can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10K and quarterly report on Form 10Q filed with the SEC and available on our website. All information in this presentation is as of today's date. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information, and with that, let me turn the call over to Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. This quarter we delivered a solid set of results, and the year is off to a good start. Our new leadership team is operating well together, and we are really starting to get our arms around the business. You will see in our numbers and the read-through that our efforts are beginning to make a difference. We also see substantial need for continued retooling of the company, how we work with our customers, and how we execute. We are encouraged by the progress to date, but remain realistic that we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity to drive profitable growth ahead of us.\nWhat we said at the start of the year still holds.\nThis is a transition year where we are focused on execution and making critical choices that will set the business up for long-term success. We have a plan that will return this company to where it needs to be, and remain focused on execution to get there. We see clear opportunities for operational improvements across our large enterprise, small business, and consumer businesses, including Venmo, in driving more efficiency across the organization. It will take time to prudently drive a meaningful and sustainable transformation. In the first quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis on $404 billion in total payment volume.\nTransaction margin dollar performance grew 4%, which was better than expected thanks in part to actions we took. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 27% year-over-year.\nOur results are stronger than we expected earlier in the year, and they require some unpacking to put them in the context of the full year. What I want you to understand is what we are focused on, namely making surgical changes to the way we are running the company. Some of these will have an immediate impact, and others will take longer to bear fruit. As such, we need to maintain flexibility throughout this year to make important decisions to drive the long term growth of the business.\nThis includes decisions about where we prioritize and reinvest, how we go to market, and actions that can be taken to sharpen our value proposition for consumers and merchants. With that in mind, we do now expect full year EPS to grow mid to high single digits, which is partially driven by our better than expected start to the year.\nJamie will take you through our Q1 results, contours of the year, and updated guidance in just a few moments. Let me first spend some time providing an update on our execution against our customer strategies and investment priorities, and detail progress on our efforts to operate more efficiently. Turning to our three customer groups, we continue to make steady progress on strengthening our strategic positioning and product portfolio for large enterprises. We continue to focus on accelerating growth in branded checkout and driving the profitability of our business.\nWe are executing to get upgrades to our core branded checkout experiences to the market. We continue to make good progress in our early testing of Fast Lane by PayPal with a focused group of merchants, and data from those alpha merchants show that returning Fast Lane users are converting at nearly 80%.\nWe are just getting started and already creating a low double-digit lift in guest checkout conversion for participating merchants. The results so far are encouraging, as incremental conversion improves our merchants' growth and profits. Demand for this product is promising, and we expect to make Fast Lane by PayPal generally available in the US in the second half of the year. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on making it even easier to pay with PayPal by removing friction from the checkout process.\nIn the coming months, we will continue to move to more passwordless authentication processes like Biometrics, and launch a redesigned mobile checkout experience, which we believe will result in higher conversion rates. We've begun active discussions with our largest enterprise customers to focus on commercial outcomes that reflect the true value of our payments processing platform and the services we provide.\nAs we speak, many of our top merchants are gathered in California for our annual Commerce360 customer conference, where our teams will go deep on the innovations we plan to bring to market this year, and the value they can provide. We are also in the early stages of evaluating the overall dynamics and pipeline of our top 10,000 merchant accounts. As we evaluate our programs, we see clear opportunities to price to value, not only with our PSP processing, but especially with our value added services that we already provide, services such as payouts, fraud prevention, and processing orchestration.\nThis process will take time, but we have a focused game plan, and we are already having fruitful conversations that are helping merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us, including through our value added services.\nFor example, DraftKings recently went live with our fraud management solution, Fraud Protection Advanced, which combines our intelligence with advanced machine learning and analytics to help businesses protect themselves from ever-evolving fraud threats. This is an example of a best-in-class offering and a key differentiator against our competitors. It also showcases our ability to leverage AI to drive customer benefit, and is an area where we can price to the value we provide for small and medium-sized businesses. The launch of our PayPal Complete Payments platform has been gaining momentum over the past couple of quarters.\nWe've made good progress in expanding PPCP's geographic reach to now more than 34 countries. In the first quarter, we expanded the platform to Canada, the UK, and more than 20 European markets. We also added new features to PPCP in Australia, Germany, and the US in recent months.\nAdditionally, we are seeing positive response to our new low and no code tools for merchants and developers to integrate PPCP, which we launched in March. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately 7% of our SMB volume is already on PayPal Complete Payments, with our team focused on distribution through partners that can accelerate adoption to the largest number of customers. Our efforts here are important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest Branded Checkout integration, which will include Fast Lane by PayPal, so that consumers have a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop, and merchants will benefit from higher conversion.\nOn average, merchants who adopt PPCP use approximately four PayPal products, which deepens the relationship and reduces churn. This translates to an average revenue per account for a PPCP full stack merchant that is nearly two times that of an SMB on a legacy integration.\nAs you all know, I have a deep passion for helping small businesses succeed. Frankly, this is an area where PayPal took its eye off the ball. Over the years, we've deprecated products and made pricing decisions that negatively affected our market positioning. Despite that, we still have the largest population of SMBs anywhere who are using our products, and eager for us to do more for them. This is an area where we are investing to correct our course. We are here to serve and win the small business market.\nOn the consumer front, the PayPal app is at the center of our strategy to leverage the power of our data to create more value for our customers and unlock new sources of revenue and margin expansion opportunities. In the first quarter, we revamped the PayPal app with a new look and feel, and introduced enhancements to our rewards program to enable shoppers to get the most out of their money while increasing conversion for merchants. Additionally, we began testing a comprehensive rewards-focused lifecycle marketing program. When tested with approximately 20% of our PayPal app users, we saw it drive a nearly 7% increase in weekly\napp logins and 4% increase in transaction margin per user. Introducing consumers to new products like our debit card that can help maximize the value they receive from PayPal is a major focus.\nThe enhancements our team made to our onboarding flow enabled a 38% increase in debit card first time users during the first quarter. On average, a customer who adopts the PayPal debit card is more engaged, generating a 2x lift to transaction activity, and a nearly 20% increase to average revenue per account compared to users who primarily use checkout. Approximately 4% of our active PayPal consumer accounts in the US have a debit card. While we have a lot more to do, this work is meaningful to the economics of our business. In the quarter, we onboarded BigCommerce and WooCommerce to our package tracking solution.\nIn the 12 months since launch, we've had approximately 7 million active accounts use package tracking. This is a key pillar in our post purchase strategy.\nPackage tracking not only allows consumers to track their shipments within the PayPal app, but will also enable us to make personalized purchase recommendations and present relevant offers through the app and our AI-powered Smart Receipts. We believe these innovations will drive engagement with the PayPal app and incentivize future Branded Checkout activity for Venmo. We are focused on giving our customers more ways to immediately use their Venmo Debit Card in person with Apple Pay and Google Pay, which you will see in the market in the coming months.\nIn the first quarter, we saw a 21% year-over-year increase in consumers using our Venmo Debit Card. Remember, Venmo Debit Card holders are among the most engaged accounts and, on average, drive six times the incremental revenue than that of a P2P-only customer.\nSimultaneously, we are making it easier for consumers to use their Venmo balance when making payments or sending money to friends. In the first quarter, balance funded P2P senders grew by 17%, which contributed to our overall transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. Our leadership team is continuing to go through our business from top to bottom, understanding where we can operate more efficiently and invest in the innovation that will offer the greatest impact for our customers and PayPal. This is a mindset shift we are driving throughout the entire organization.\nInvesting for durable growth, backed by a clear payback path and time horizon, remains a top priority. Investing in branded checkout and better serving our small business customers are two focus areas you heard me talk about today.\nWe are also actively evaluating and greenlighting new investments to accelerate future growth that support and strengthen our strategic priorities. A good example of this is our remittance business Xoom, which has stagnated while similar services have gained share. This business has been on a negative revenue trajectory due to a lack of prioritization and clarity about its value proposition that is now changing. We are executing the right product refinements, bundled with an enhanced and more customizable pricing model, and intended to promote growth over the long run.\nWe plan to reduce the cost of cross border transfers and provide consumers the option to eliminate transaction fees altogether when funding with our PyUSD stablecoin. We are activating those plans, and we expect to see tangible progress throughout 2024 and beyond.\nThe key takeaway here is that we are in the process of assessing a handful of areas of investment where we believe there are compelling unit economics and market upside. These may mean that we will make decisions to invest in 2024 where we believe these investments will ultimately contribute to the sustainable and profitable growth of the company. At the same time, we must maintain our focus. We are continuing to evaluate the markets we operate in, and the products we offer. Where we see areas to improve focus and prioritization, we will take action and update you accordingly.\nFinally, a few words on our continued efforts to drive operational efficiency and productivity across PayPal. We are instilling a rigorous cost benefit discipline throughout the company, and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs.\nWe are also investing in automation that will help answer our customers' frequently asked questions, simplify the integration process for our merchants, and enable our team to deploy solutions more quickly. As mentioned on the last earnings call, we have started reporting stock-based compensation as part of our non-GAAP metrics beginning this quarter. In addition to our annual incentive plan shifting to cash payment from stock, we have also better aligned our incentive programs to performance, particularly focusing on transaction margin and non-GAAP operating income growth.\nWe will continue to focus on a pay-for-performance culture that appropriately aligns pay with results.\nI'll conclude by thanking the PayPal team for continuing to innovate and serve our customers while we are still in the early innings of driving a meaningful and comprehensive transformation of PayPal to deliver the sustainable and high-quality growth we are aiming for. Our first quarter results are an encouraging indication of what our team's renewed strategic focus and persistent execution can achieve. We will continue to update you on our execution throughout the year, and be transparent about our progress. I'm confident that we are taking the right steps to build long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jamie to take you through our first quarter results.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Alex. Good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year with first quarter results that were above our expectations. As Alex mentioned, it's still early in the company's transformation. We are getting deeper and understanding both our challenges and our opportunities with much greater clarity. Our goal for 2024 is to foundationally set up the business for the future by making key decisions and aligning our investment path for growth. To do so, we are laser focused on strategic analysis and decision making, driving innovation back into the business, and executing with excellence.\nWhile it will take time for our efforts to sustainably flow through results, the speed at which the team is moving is encouraging, and we are making steady progress. Let me start with a summary of our financial performance.\nAs a reminder, our non-GAAP results now include the impact of stock-based compensation, expense, and related payroll taxes. This change is intended to enhance transparency, operating discipline, and align our performance measures to how many investors already evaluate our business. Now moving to our results. As Alex mentioned, in the first quarter revenue increased 9% at spot and 10% on a currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 4% year-over-year, improving in growth by more than 400 basis points from the fourth quarter.\nI'll walk through the drivers of that growth in a few minutes and provide context on the shape of the year, including tailwinds that we expect to be more pronounced in the first half compared to the second half. Under our updated non-GAAP methodology, earnings per share were $1.08, representing 27% year-over-year growth.\nUnder the company's prior non-GAAP methodology, which excluded the impact of stock-based compensation, earnings per share would have increased approximately 20% to $1.40, above our guidance for mid-single-digit growth. On a comparable basis relative to our outlook, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including better than expected transaction margin dollars, ongoing expense discipline, the timing of certain investment and marketing spend, and interest income. Now I'll walk through some key operating metrics that support those results.\nWe ended the first quarter with 427 million total active accounts and 220 million monthly active accounts. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the fourth quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts, in addition to other products.\nWe were encouraged to see total active accounts inflect positively in the quarter, and we remain focused on driving deeper relationships and more activity across our customer base. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 220 million, with contribution from both PayPal and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing twelve month number, was 60 in the first quarter, up 13%. Excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, transactions per active account grew 7%. Moving to volume growth in the first quarter, TPV grew 14% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $403.9 billion.\nUS TPV grew 12%. International TPV grew 17% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in continental Europe and improvement in Asia. Global branded checkout growth accelerated to 7% on a currency neutral basis from 5% in the fourth quarter.\nThe first quarter included about a 1 point benefit from leap day, as well as ongoing benefits from the growth of global marketplaces. Within Branded Checkout, large enterprise and international markets were the biggest contributors to growth. We remain laser focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small and medium-sized businesses, and improving our mobile experience, which are critical, particularly in markets like the US and the UK. PSP Processing volume grew 26% in the quarter, driven by continued momentum from Braintree, compared to 29% in the fourth quarter.\nConversations with merchants have been encouraging as we shift our focus to a more disciplined go-to-market and renewal process that emphasizes a focus on profitable growth. Merchants recognize the product and performance improvements we have already started to make, and are excited about the pipeline of upcoming innovation.\nAs I noted earlier, revenue in the first quarter increased 9% at spot and 10% on a currency neutral basis to $7.7 billion. Transaction revenue grew 11% on a spot basis to $7 billion, driven by Braintree and branded checkout, other value added services. Revenue in the quarter declined 2% on a spot basis to $665 million. Within other value added services, interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind. Our credit business performed relatively in line with our expectations, with revenue lower because of two main factors. First, we are carrying lower merchant receivables after tightening originations last year.\nSecond, we have had lower revenue share on our off balance sheet US Consumer revolving credit portfolio due to ongoing normalization of loss rates. Transaction take rate declined 5 basis points to 1.74%, driven primarily by lower foreign exchange fees and lower gains from foreign currency hedges.\nIn addition, mix shift to large merchants continued to impact our branded checkout take rate. Transaction margin dollars increased 4% in the first quarter. Higher interest on customer balances, branded checkout, better transaction loss performance, and lower credit losses were the largest contributors to growth. While the performance of the core business has been relatively consistent, we expect that a few of these tailwinds are likely to be less meaningful as we move through the year. Specifically, we expect to see lower year-over-year benefit from interest on customer balances and lower year-over-year improvement on transaction and loan loss\nperformance. Non transaction related operating expenses declined 2% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting into key strategic initiatives.\nPart of the decline in operating expenses is a result of certain corporate and marketing investments deferred to the second half, as well as lower stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating income grew 15% in the quarter to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded 84 basis points to 18.2%. PayPal generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter, or $1.9 billion excluding the impact of held for sale accounting related to our European buy now pay later externalization. In the quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5.1 billion.\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $17.7 billion, and debt of $11 billion. I'll now move to our second quarter and 2024 guidance.\nConsistent with the approach we shared in February, we will continue to provide revenue guidance one quarter at a time. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 6.5% at spot and 7% on a currency neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to increase by a low double-digit percentage for the full year. We continue to plan for a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment. With respect to earnings per share, we now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow by a mid to high single-digit percentage.\nAs Alex said earlier, we are in a transition year and we do not expect that our quarterly progression will be linear. To help bridge this outlook compared to our prior guidance for approximately flat non-GAAP EPS, there are two main factors I would point you to.\nFirst, our inclusion of stock-based compensation expense within non-GAAP results is expected to benefit EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points this year. Second, we saw meaningful outperformance in the first quarter relative to our plans. We intend to reinvest a portion of this performance back into the business. We expect earnings growth to be more muted in the second half of the year due primarily to less benefit from interest income on customer balances, normalization in transaction and loan loss performance.\nAs we progress through the year and the expected timing of investment actions underpinning our outlook, we now expect transaction margin dollars to be slightly positive for the full year. We expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly.\nEmbedded within this outlook is the flexibility to make key strategic decisions to invest and reinvigorate profitable growth within components of the portfolio, and accelerate go to market efforts for the full year. We expect other value added services revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year. This excludes any potential impact from the CFPB late fee regulation given pending litigation across the banking industry and uncertainty on both timing and implementation. As a company, we have already taken steps to mitigate the future impact, though these take time to fully take hold.\nConsistent with the approach we shared last quarter, our guidance includes minimal impact from the new innovations rolling out this year. Our focus is on execution as we begin moving from test and pilot phases into launch.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion and for at least $5 billion in share buybacks. In closing, 2024 is off to a solid start as we drive significant change across the company, we have clear opportunities to lean in further. We are doing the hard work now to position PayPal for profitable growth in the years ahead, and it has been incredibly energizing to see the team's commitment to this goal. With that, I'll now hand it back to the operator to begin Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tin Jin Wang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nTin Jin Wang\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, thanks so much for all the detail here up front. I just want to ask on transaction margin dollars, if you don't mind the acceleration there, maybe can you give us a little bit more detail on the growth across the main businesses, Branded Checkout, unbranded, and what we've been calling other. Of course, on the other side, I'd love to hear if there's any change in thinking there on the strategy to reclaim growth or even divest some of those assets. Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thank you, Tin Jin. Let me hand it over to Jamie to walk you through transaction margin, and then I'll take the more strategic piece on other and how we think about the year.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings\n\nMorning, Tin Jin. I'll just walk you through the drivers for transaction margin growth during the quarter. You know, we were happy with the positive growth progression. You know, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a lot underway to really position the company for positive TM growth over time. In the quarter, just to walk it a little bit, interest income on customer balances was the highest contributor. Branded Checkout continued to grow profitably, and was a nice contributor to our growth this quarter. We did benefit from Leap Day, we also benefited from strength in large enterprise and international.\nWe've been very focused this year on PSP profitability, and that will ramp over time. It wasn't a meaningful contributor this quarter, and we've just had small, but I'd say steady, ongoing product improvements in Venmo in P2P.\nWe saw some shifting there and better transaction and credit loss performance. Lastly, to the last point of your question, we did see smaller drag from the other smaller parts of the portfolio. I don't know, Alex, if you want to talk through that a little bit.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, let me just sort of take a step back, Tin Jin, and talk about how we've been thinking about the year. You know, you've heard us talk about this as a transition year. You know, the way we've really been focusing the team is on sort of three different components to make sure that we're set up well for profitable growth into the future. The first is accelerating innovation and ensuring that we've got best-in-class innovation, whether that's on the consumer side and ensuring that our customers have a frictionless, incredible experience in checkout to an unbranded side where we allow our merchants to have, again, best processing available.\nReally accelerating the velocity of our innovation.\nThe second is adoption and ensuring that once that innovation is actually in the market, our consumers are using it, our merchants are onboarding to our latest and greatest integrations. I'll give you an example we talked about in the last call, the opportunity for debit card engagement. We changed the onboarding flow inside of the PayPal app this past quarter and saw 69% higher debit card engagement just by changing that flow. A big focus on the team is not just delivering our innovation, but actually delivering the adoption. Lastly, as you mentioned, cleaning up some of our underperforming services. I mentioned Xoom on the call.\nThat is a business that we looked at very hard.\nIt's been underperforming for a couple of years now, and we wanted to make a decision on is this an asset that's strategic to the business that should be a profitable grower for us or not. When we looked at it, we realized that there were just opportunities where we had priced ourselves out of the market in a number of different corridors that we could make strategic decisions on and actually make this a profitable growing business. That's just an example. We're going top to bottom throughout the organization, and there will be some businesses or markets that don't meet that cut, and we'll let you know when we make those decisions.\nThere will be other ones that, with focus and execution, will turn around.\n\nTin Jin Wang\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks. You know, I think it would be helpful if you don't mind just first revisiting some of the initiatives around Unbranded and your conviction and the timing around the impact from them on perhaps on transaction margin, but maybe even more specifically if you've had discussions with Braintree merchants around pricing. I think you touched on some of the prepared remarks, but more pricing to value than pricing to win, how are those conversations going?\nI guess, Alex, market wide, when we think about the appreciation of the value added services and differentiator for PayPal's two sided network, how has that been resonating in the market lately?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah. Thank you, Darrin. Just to sort of paint the high picture on Unbranded, this is an important segment for us both for Enterprise and for small business. We have to nail the basics, right? Our customers are looking for the best auth rates, the best uptime, the best availability, the best reliability, and those are things that we are now providing. I think over the last few years as we've been building the service, whether it's Braintree or now with PPCP, we've been investing in that and establishing a beachhead for our product across the market.\nIn doing so, we also have been building value-added services that, to be totally transparent, we haven't been able to price to value or we haven't been able to ensure that we're engaged with our customers in a real end-to-end strategic conversation.\nThat's changing now. To your question, we're having great conversations with both enterprise and small business merchants around our end-to-end solutions. The value-added services that we can now bring to bear really, more strategic conversations as you mentioned, around the two-sided network, both an unbranded, a branded, and then even things like our new marketing and ad platform in the mix. We're now having really deep conversations with our merchants that again are strategic for them and extract the value of the services that we're providing. Very encouraged with these conversations.\nObviously, it's going to take time, especially for some of the largest merchants. It just takes time for them to roll out and adopt.\nOur teams right now are, as I mentioned on the call, in LA with our Customer360 conference, showing them all the innovations and having really, really good conversations. Encouraged with the start. It's just going to take time throughout the year.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy?E. Chiodo\n\nManaging Director and Lead Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question.\nI wanted to [inaudible] plain two parts really. One around mechanics, one around the uplift on the mechanics. There might be two ways to go about this. One is to make it a part of your unbranded offering, and it could be either part of your negotiations on pricing. It could be a separate fee, but any way you look at it in that scenario would be more of a if Fast Lane by PayPal, then Braintree does the processing. The alternative way would be for it to be more of a as a service and available on a processor-agnostic basis. Want to see first if you can give us color on which routes you might be able to take or maybe both.\nLastly, on the uplift, which is if we think about the range of net take rates with unbranded at the low end and branded at the high end, where do you think Fast Lane could eventually reside on that spectrum? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks, Tim. Let me take the first part and see if Jamie wants to add anything in. You know, we are really excited about Fast Lane as it now gets to market. You know, we are live with a handful of early partners, and the results just continue to impress. Just as a reminder, you know, we're now enabling 80% conversion rate for returning users through a guest checkout flow. What's even more exciting that we've now been able to start to see with these early merchants is that we're actually seeing unrecognized users. These are non-PayPal users opting in to Fastlane at a 40% rate.\nThat just shows the power of our brand, and it shows the power of what PayPal can be.\nIt goes a little bit to your question around how we think about pricing it and how we think about go to market, because it's even beyond just an unbranded processing element. I don't want to unveil exactly how our go to market will work, but that data point shows that this is not just within a PayPal ecosystem. This is allowing us to actually take the brand that we've established over 25 years and leverage that for our merchants to deliver incredible checkout conversion rate for the 60% of the market that continues to go through a guest checkout experience. We're really encouraged by the early signs there in terms of rollout and how we think about it.\nObviously on the PPCP side, as we continue to deliver Fast Lane to that platform through many of our platform partners, it becomes easy for our small businesses to one click, turn that on. That will be a big part of our rollout, and having good merchant conversations as well on the large enterprise side. Those are kicking off really in earnest this week at our Commerce360 conference. The last thing I'd say just on pricing, and then Jamie Miller, if you want to add anything, is because we've focused this year on a transition year, we may get very aggressive on the pricing side when it comes to Fast Lane for 2024 because we want to drive adoption.\nWe think this is the best in the market innovation that all merchants should have access to.\nAs they think about winning this shopping season, our encouragement is improve the onboarding for them, create low code, no code opportunities for them to get up and running as fast as possible so that they can win this season and really prove to themselves that conversion improvement and, you know, rest assured we'll be pricing to value over time to ensure that we get the right value from that. Jamie, anything you'd add?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings\n\nNo, I think you've said it all. I really think Fast Lane reinforces our holistic value prop, both for branded and for unbranded, and the focus on merchant checkout conversion. That being at our core, I think drives a strong value prop, and it will support strong pricing over time.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThe only thing that I would just last point is this conversion rate with Fast Lane. What's so exciting to me is not just the 40% that's coming in as unrecognized users leveraging our brand, and the 80% conversion rate of guest checkout for returning users. This is just early days. This is with a handful of merchants. This is a network effect. As we gain more and more users coming through, as these users now become returning users over and over again, those rates should continue to improve. This is already an order of magnitude better than anything else in the market.\nWith the network effect and scale that we have, we just expect it to continue to get better. Excellent.\n\nTimothy?E. Chiodo\n\nManaging Director and Lead Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ramsey?El?Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey?El?Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Thanks so much for taking my question this morning. Alex, could you comment on the European Commission ruling to open up the iPhone NFC hardware on the handset and whether you see that as a competitive opening for PayPal in Europe? I know there's some rumblings in the US as well about that type of opening. I mean, how ready from a product perspective are you to take advantage of a more open NFC environment? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thank you for the question, Ramsey. Let me set the context so that it's clear how we think about it. First, we must play in an omnichannel world. We have established ourselves as the leader in the market in online, and our customers love us and use us globally for online checkout.\nThey are demanding an offline opportunity, an omnichannel opportunity, and to get the value that we're able to provide. As we start to deliver not only the basics of our security and flexibility, but also as our rewards platform continues to improve, we want to be able to deliver a PayPal service for customers everywhere, anytime, every purchase. We will be playing in an omnichannel environment where there are locations where NFC opens up, that obviously becomes a very easy opportunity for us to provide a wallet in an Android or iPhone operating system. We will be ready.\nIf there are environments where it's not available, we will still operate in an omnichannel. Omnichannel is a strategic initiative for us. It's something that is customer back and delivers an incredible PayPal experience again for every purchase and every checkout.\nWe'll take advantage of whatever market, whatever features and functionality we have in whatever market we play in.\n\nRamsey?El?Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. I just have a two-part question. The first, just following up on the transaction profit, dollar growth. I know you're now expecting slightly positive for the year. I guess that would seem to imply maybe a little bit of deceleration from the Q1 levels, even though the second half comps are a little easier. Just wanted to get a sense of whether, you know, that's conservatism or just some normalization of things like transaction and loan loss that helped you in Q1. The second part is just, is there any change in your full year expectations for branded payment volume growth? Thank you.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings\n\nGood morning, Jason. Just to walk through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamics on transaction margin dollars, as I talked about before and you noted, I mean Q1 in particular benefited from a few tailwinds, and we do expect those will be less meaningful as we move throughout the year. First of all, the growth in our interest income on customer balances was the largest contributor. When you start to look at later in the year, the comps just get more challenging. Rates were rising the last half of last year. We also saw improvement in transaction loss and credit loss in the first quarter.\nTransaction loss in particular may not sustain or may not be as material as we move throughout the year. We saw, as you pointed out, a meaningful benefit in loan losses in the first quarter.\nWe don't expect that to continue either. I'd say those few things are some of the dynamic, and then our initiatives and some of the new innovation that Alex talked about will take time to ramp. Right now we're focused on execution. We want to keep expectations measured until we see really steady execution results.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nJust to underline Jamie's point, we have not put, or we have put limited upside to this innovation that we've talked about in these expectations. Again, this is about us having the flexibility, us ensuring that we take the right time and do the right thing by the customers, as well as building the long term. Those are not built into the rest of the year.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you asked about branded as well. When we look at that, we had a nice quarter in terms of TPV and revenue. It was a healthy contributor to our transaction margin dollars. You know, we did have some benefit this quarter from Leap Day, but by and large we expect branded revenue trends to be pretty consistent with last year as we look at that. I guess the other comment I might make is that when you think about take rate for us, we saw a decent drop last year. We do expect take rate will come down again this year, but not nearly to the same extent.\nA little bit of that as it comes through on the branded trend line is just that we're seeing a little bit of mixing towards large enterprise from SMB, and that's impacting the take rate side.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just two for me. First, I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the drags on the smaller part of the, from the smaller part of the portfolio and transaction margin dollars. You know, when does that kind of work itself out of the system? Related to transaction margin dollar growth, you know, you talked about balance funded Venmo transactions contributing to growth in the quarter. Could you expand a little bit on that? You know, do you see that scaling over the next couple of years? You know, what are the opportunities to improve card attach for Venmo users? Thank you.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings\n\nGreat. Good morning, Mike. On the smaller parts of the portfolio, I guess what I'd say at a macro level, we had seen a pretty significant drag on that last year. It is coming through this year at a smaller rate. I mean, part of these are products we've deprecated. Some of these are, frankly, acquisitions that we just haven't invested in. As Alex mentioned, we're going through a process of really looking hard at these. You know, candidly, some are just in decline, but the declines are smaller, and some we're investing in or making decisions to really put more in maintenance mode, which is really shifting the profile going forward.\nIt will be smaller this year, and it'll take a few years for that to burn off.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, let me talk about, you know, up level and talk about Venmo for a minute and the opportunity there. Again, you know, on the positive side, we have, you know, the leading P2P platform with incredible customer base with disposable income 22% higher than the US average, 60 million monthly active users, and 90 million 12-month actives. This is an incredible platform for us to work at. As we've talked about in previous calls, and I'll reiterate here, I'm dissatisfied in how we've really thought about monetizing the platform and really thought about delivering in many ways, just customer experiences that they're looking for. Right.\nCustomers of Venmo are looking for dollars and looking for an alternative to traditional mechanisms when dollars are flowing in, and they want to be able to use Venmo for all of their expenses.\nJust to give you, put some numbers behind it, there's $18 billion of net new funds that flow into the platform of Venmo every single month. 80% of those dollars leave within 10 days. That is just unacceptable. Our ability to provide the products and services that our customers need when those dollars come in, whether that's improving debit card penetration, which you've heard is a focus, and you've heard we already, in some of our onboarding flows, are starting to make some significant improvements on, or providing other opportunities for money in or money out opportunities and access to capital for our Venmo users, this is just a clear opportunity\nand a clear focus area for us. Again, early days, the team is focused on it.\nHopefully you hear sort of a reinvigoration in my voice of what Venmo can be, and the opportunity ahead of us, but very, very excited about where we're taking it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Keen with Georgia Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Keen\n\nAnalyst, Georgia Bank\n\nHi, good morning. Solid first quarter results here. My question is just still more on the big picture. You know, the naysayers on PayPal would say the company is structurally challenged with the rise of payment methods like Apple Pay. Alex, I know you've been at PayPal now for a little over six months. What do you think the naysayers are missing on the competitive advantages PayPal still has in the market, in particular to grow branded.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, Brian. Thanks for the question. A couple of thoughts here that I think people are maybe not appreciating enough. The first is 60% of the market is still what I would consider to be non consumption. 60% of the market still does not use any mark. That's what we're playing for. We have the best brand, the best products and services, and the best ability to be able to deliver. With products like Fast Lane, not only delivering a reboarding opportunity for our customers, but that stat that I put in earlier, around 40% of unrecognized customers coming through and taking a Fast Lane experience, now gives us an opportunity to be able to\nremarket to them and turn them into PayPal customers. Step one, 60% of the market is non consumption, and I think we've got a leading opportunity there.\nOn the other 40% we're still the leading player. To be again transparent, and I've said this before, we have not delivered the innovation and the experience that I would expect and that our customers expect. We are doing that now. An improvement in the app, an improvement in the branded experience, reducing latency by 50%, investing in passwordless opportunities, and passkeys will improve the conversion rate and improve the experience, and then creating value-added opportunities and an increased value proposition for our consumers with rewards.\nI think we're the only player out there at the scale that we have to provide that end-to-end experience. Again, we provide everything for our customers. It's rewards, it's buy now, pay later, it's a debit experience.\nBack to what I mentioned earlier on the call, with an omnichannel play, now PayPal can be the solution that you can use anytime, anywhere. Our ability to now start to play in an offline world and take the same brand and the same experience to every purchase I think is something that again gets me excited. We've got to prove it, and we've got to continue to execute and create great experiences in the market for our customers.\n\nBrian Keen\n\nAnalyst, Georgia Bank\n\nThat's great. Just that one follow up, we are getting a few questions on the pending CFPB regulation on late fees. Any impact on PayPal from CFPB caps on late fees?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO and Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings",
    "content2": "Yeah, Mike. First, while PayPal is not directly impacted by that regulation, we are indirectly impacted through our revenue share with our consumer credit partner. There is a lot of uncertainty right now around both timing and implementation of that. As I mentioned before, our guide excludes the impact of that. Given the uncertainty, the industry expects that if implemented, the impacts would be largely offset over time. We have been very focused on mitigation. We have actions underway, but really in any scenario it takes time for those offsets to fully set in. What I'd say in terms of impact is the date that's being debated right now is a 14 May 2024 implementation date.\nIf that were to be implemented, it would be approximately a 3% impact to EPS growth for the year. That is before mitigation.\nBy 2025, we would expect roughly half of that impact to be offset, and then more over time.\n\nBrian Keen\n\nAnalyst, Georgia Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames?E. Faucette\n\nSenior Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much. I wanted to go back to Fast Lane, and Alex, you made the comments around making Fast Lane available to all merchants and derive it so that they can derive the benefits of it. How should we think about that in terms of what needs to be done, timeline for progression, etc.? It sounds like you're going to start moving beyond at least those initial merchants that are using it now. Just trying to think about how that ultimately could end up with most of the first the merchants served by Braintree, and then ultimately the merchants served by PayPal more broadly.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks, James. Here's the best way to think about it. First and foremost, we have to have the best innovation in the market. It was important for us to get some early customers up and running and using it. The data continues to hold and certainly delight these, these merchants. Look, in this world, they all talk to each other, so the ability for our merchants to now be rabid fans of the checkout conversion improvement that they're seeing through Fast Lane is great proof points for us as we now start to scale it and, again, think about price to value.\nThe second leg will be okay. Now that we've proven this out and we've started to really, I mean, just to be clear, we're talking about driving conversion rate for some of the largest merchants in the world.\nWe need to make sure that this was proven and that it works before we roll this out at scale. You know, there's a lot on the line to be able to nail this, which is why we're moving at a measured pace and ensuring that in Q1 and Q2 we've really proven it out. The conversations we're having at our C360 conference right now, the conversations we're having with some of our PPCP platforms that are now rolling it out to small businesses, is okay.\nWhat is the way that as we get to the second half of the year, we can really enable the merchants to have this up and running so that they can win the shopping season and the holiday season in the back half of the year. That's how we're thinking about it. Merchant demand is very encouraging, as you would imagine.\nWhen you have a product that improves conversion rate and provides a double-digit lift in guest checkout conversion, that's a game changer, and demand is high. We want to make sure that we have as low friction an onboarding experience as possible, which is why we wanted to make sure that the ability for folks to upgrade to the new integrations would make sense and be easy for them. We wanted to make sure that customers could onboard. The plan is back half of the year, get as many merchants on so that they can win the holiday season. This will still take time.\nNot everyone will get on for this holiday season, and we expect that will continue into 2025.\nAt some point there will be a tipping point, you know, if I think about over the next year or two years, where we are going to expect all of our merchants to be on the latest and greatest integration, which includes Fast Lane, and we will then move to deprecate our old integrations. That's going to be an important milestone for us as we take what is really 15 years of legacy integrations and consolidate them on a more modern stack and a more modern integration for our customers that allows us to continue to build innovation, continue to drive the best\nexperiences for merchants, for customers, and obviously the best transaction margin results for the company as well.\n\nJames?E. Faucette\n\nSenior Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great. Appreciate the color there, Alex. You mentioned you're getting a little bit of improvement in Venmo transaction margin. How much of that is coming from increased acceptance of Venmo as a payment option versus finding ways to reduce costs in transacting Venmo and P2P transactions, etc.? Just trying to understand kind of what the drivers there are and what potential could be.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, it is a combination. What I'd say is we're seeing pay with Venmo really starting to take off. Obviously in the US, it's an incredibly well-loved brand, and when people see that button, it's an opportunity for them to use those dollars that I mentioned earlier that are in their account. That's an exciting piece online. The piece that, again, I'm sort of dissatisfied with but excited about the future, is the offline piece. Right. When I talk about omnichannel, it's for PayPal and for Venmo.\nThose billions of dollars that are coming in every month into the Venmo ecosystem, we have to continue to give our customers opportunities, whether it's debit card penetration or other innovation that we come up with for them to be able to tap and pay and check out. All of that will move towards improving transaction margin.\nThat said, we're also getting better with our risk models and leveraging AI. There's a lot of AI conversations in the market. I would say we are one of the leaders when it comes to leveraging the data that we have at scale to improve our transaction losses, improve the customer service ability for our customers, and improve our transaction margin over time. Still, again, early days. There's a lot of work to continue there. Again, my excitement for the path and the direction for Venmo is pretty high.\n\nJames?E. Faucette\n\nSenior Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call back to Alex Chriss for closing remarks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nFantastic. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can tell from our results and the comments today, we're making steady progress on our transformation efforts. We had a good first quarter, and we are deep in execution mode. With time, we will return this company to profitable growth that I know we can deliver. Thank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter 2023. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press STAR followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press STAR one again. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ryan Wallace, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Wallace\n\nHead of Investor Relations, PayPal Holdings\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining PayPal's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is Alex Chriss, our President and CEO, and Jamie Miller, CFO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast. Both the presentation and call are available on our investor relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.\nYou can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10K and quarterly report on Form 10Q filed with the SEC and available on our investor relations website. All information in this presentation is as of today's date. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. It's been a productive first four months. I'm pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in such a short period of time while delivering the solid financial results we will discuss today. More importantly, I'm excited about the foundation we're setting, and the velocity at which we're executing as we enter 2024.\nToday, I'd like to walk you through.\nThe changes we've made to the structure of our company, including several key additions to our leadership team, give a clear roadmap for how we will be executing going forward, and share our strategic priorities for 2024. Jamie will take you through the fourth quarter and full year results in greater detail, but the headline is that we delivered a solid quarter during the most important shopping season for our customers. In Q4, we delivered 9% revenue growth on $410 billion in total payment volume. Transaction margin dollar performance was better than expected in the fourth quarter, and we continued strong expense discipline, reducing non-transaction related expenses by 9% year over year. Taken together with $600 million in share repurchases in the quarter, our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% year over year.\nWhile these are solid results, we know there is still much room for improvement, and we're committed to making the necessary changes to our business and how we invest and operate to get it right. One of the key changes I talked about in our last earnings call was ensuring we have an outstanding leadership team in place. It's important to me that we have a leadership team with a broad diversity of experience, deep operational rigor, and leaders with track records of success.\nI'm thrilled with the talent that we've assembled in the last few months, with Jamie as our new CFO, Isabel Cruz leading people and places, Michelle Gill leading small business and financial services, Susan Kereere leading global markets, and Diego Scotti leading consumer and global marketing and communications. Combined with talented leaders who have risen within PayPal, we have a world-class leadership team in place to help the organization reach its full potential. Each of these leaders chose to join PayPal because they see the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us to reshape commerce, and they're already driving a renewed energy within the company. Second, we've organized our teams around the customers we serve: consumers, small businesses, and enterprises. This creates clear lines of accountability and will enable teams to focus on delivering the right solutions that address our customers' greatest needs.\nRegardless of the customer we're serving, we want to make the PayPal offering so user friendly, so rewarding, and so integrated into a customer's life that PayPal is the obvious choice. Our new structure enables that. Third, last week we announced that we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 9% through both direct reductions and the elimination of open roles over the course of the year. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, our size has been slowing us down. While this was not an easy decision to make, this change is necessary to execute with the focus and speed required to drive our next chapter of growth and allow us to invest in our future. With these changes, we continue to reprioritize and invest in the innovation and delivery of products and solutions that offer the greatest impact for our customers.\nThe team has been very focused on building out our strategy and driving focused execution for 2024. These are the most important priorities we're focused on this year: accelerating growth in Branded Checkout business, improving overall profitability, including that of our high growth PSP services, unlocking the power of data to create more value for our customers while tapping into new sources of revenue and margin, and operating more efficiently. Our first Look customer announcement two weeks ago was an initial demonstration of the importance of delivering compelling value propositions to consumers and merchants. As promised, we're doing a lot of things to drive change internally and externally. However, nothing happens overnight. It will take time for some of our initiatives to scale and move the needle, but the initial customer reaction and merchant demand for our new innovations has been encouraging.\n2024 is going to be a transition year focused on execution to position the business for long-term success. Our clear goal is to reshape the company to accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. Prioritization will be key, allowing us to move more quickly and with better results. Later in the call, Jamie will take you through our full-year guidance. We have made strategic decisions to reinvest cost savings back into our most important initiatives. It is critical that we remain on offense and position ourselves to not only innovate, but capture our share of the growth in global commerce. We want to be clear-eyed in terms of the potential near-term benefits from our initiatives, which is why our 2024 guidance includes minimal contribution from the innovations we recently announced.\nWe want to see execution and clear results prior to embedding these initiatives into our financial outlook as a company. We will build back a track record of delivering on our commitments. In November, I committed to being transparent with you all on how we will run the business. I want to spend a few minutes to share our operating principles and how we expect these will drive value creation over time. Our five operating principles are: Number one, start with the customer. I believe in working customer back. We will start by defining our customers and their most critical needs. Then we will use that knowledge to inform everything we do, including investments and innovation. Number two, focus on profitable growth. We will prioritize high-quality, profitable growth and driving improved transaction margin dollars through more rigor and discipline. Number three, drive operating leverage over time.\nWe will combine our assets and data to develop more personalized experiences for our customers and drive efficiencies across the business to leverage our cost base. Number four, set measurable goals and communicate consistently. We say what we mean and mean what we say. We will be transparent and accountable for our performance, and number five, maintain a strong balance sheet. We will be diligent in managing our resources and returning excess cash to our shareholders. These five principles will guide how we make decisions and will ultimately keep us accountable to deliver what we say we will do. Let me now take you through what this means for how we serve our customers and what we're focused on in 2024. For enterprises, we're focused on accelerating growth Branded Checkout and driving the profitable growth of our PSP services this year.\nBranded Checkout is a critical part of PayPal's value proposition. We need to ensure we have our best checkout experience available to every consumer on every merchant every time. This will be a multi-year effort. To start, we redesigned Branded Checkout experience, creating more simplicity and consistency, with the goal of optimizing presentment, increasing speed, and minimizing friction across all major checkout flows. When combined with our efforts in passwordless authentication, these new flows can result in up to an additional 50% drop in latency, allowing a shopper to check out twice as fast. Improvements like this are aimed at driving a higher selection rate of PayPal, and better conversion for our merchants. A challenge in the past has been bringing existing merchants onto our latest integrations and experiences. This is one of the reasons why our new guest checkout experience, Fastlane by PayPal, is so exciting.\nIt's truly differentiated and will provide a compelling reason for merchants to upgrade. With it, we can recognize up to 70% of guests visiting a merchant, reduce checkout time by up to 40%, and grow the top of Branded Checkout funnel. BigCommerce, one of our longtime partners, has already implemented Fastlane on their platform, and the conversion of their merchants using this new solution is as high as 79%. Combining solutions like Fastlane with a full suite of PSP offerings, and more targeted, personalized commerce experiences, creates a powerful end-to-end suite of capabilities that drives higher sales for merchants and gives them more reason to choose PayPal. We're focused on driving profitable growth, including within our PSP services like Braintree.\nThe team continues to earn market share and merchant confidence through product and performance enhancements, delivering off rate improvements of up to 240 basis points for Enterprise customers. In the US, we're continuing to build out and seamlessly integrate additional value-added services in areas like orchestration, routing, optimization, payouts, and risk as a service. In addition to serving as a seamless integration point for our Branded Checkout experiences including PayPal, Venmo, and Buy Now Pay Later, we will be able to compete in the market with a best-in-class offering and price to value. In addition, we're putting greater discipline into our go-to-market and renewal processes as we focus on profitable growth. These areas take time to scale, but we're laser focused on them and expect to make steady progress this year.\nFor small businesses, we're on a journey to move from a variety of standalone products to a modern platform with a comprehensive suite of solutions. What this means in 2024 is that we're focused on accelerating the adoption of PayPal Complete Payments or PPCP through a reinvigorated go to market approach for partners and developers. This full stack solution enables us to distribute our Branded Checkout flow to SMBs while also competing for the approximately $750 billion addressable market of processing volumes. We've had limited penetration of SMB full stack processing to date due to the lack of a strong product, but that is now changing. November and December were record-setting months for new SMB adoption of PPCP. We're seeing lower churn rates for merchants on PPCP year over year.\nWe've also seen increases in transaction volume for merchants migrating to full stack processing from our legacy products. As the year progresses, we intend to drive additional adoption through partner channels, targeted marketing, and developer friendly capabilities like low and no code integration paths available through our brand new developer portal. Over time, we want to better serve other important SMB needs, offering more ways to help them connect to new customers. It's also worth noting that all the checkout improvements I just discussed as part of our enterprise strategy can also benefit the tens of millions of SMBs that use PayPal. For consumers, we're focused on differentiating our value proposition, deepening existing relationships, and giving shoppers more reasons to choose PayPal. PayPal already has strong consumer awareness and trust, but that is not enough to compete in today's world.\nPart of a person's decision to choose PayPal comes down to presentment, ease of use, and speed, areas where we still have room to improve. We also want to give consumers more reasons to choose PayPal by delivering personalized and rewarding shopping experiences that also drive higher conversion for merchants. This year we're launching and evolving a new PayPal app to create habituation. We will also leverage our merchant relationships and the power of AI to make the e\nntire shopping experience personalized for consumers, while giving them control over their data. In addition, we will drive increased understanding and awareness of why PayPal via sustained marketing efforts. Our goal is to drive quality customer growth over time, as well as deeper relationships that include more frequent use and a greater range of product adoption.\nThe new checkout and app experiences we are rolling out this year will also create an engagement loop that will drive higher awareness of the various products we offer, and drive higher adoption of our portfolio over time. Let me give you two examples of where we have significant opportunity to drive increased adoption. In the US, we have over 27 million active accounts using PayPal Rewards. In the fourth quarter, rewards accounts had higher engagement and average revenue per account that was almost double that of non-rewards accounts. The average revenue per account of someone who adopts the PayPal Cashback Mastercard is about five times higher than the average checkout-only account. Today, only about 2% of active accounts have that card in their wallet.\nIncreasing adoption of these products will not only drive a richer experience for our customers, but improvement in customer engagement and lifetime value for us. Redesigning our app and creating improved, frictionless onboarding paths are tangible ways that we plan to drive higher penetration of these types of products. We're also bringing more functionality and better experiences to Venmo this year, like the ability to connect consumers with cash back offers from small businesses in their local communities. In addition to this innovation, we're focused on driving adoption of the Venmo debit card. Venmo debit card holders are among our most engaged accounts and drive six times the incremental revenue than that of a P2P-only customer. About 6% of our active Venmo customers have a Venmo debit card today, so there is significant opportunity there for us to focus on.\nFinally, this year we will demonstrate meaningful progress towards operating more efficiently. We've already consolidated many disparate technology services into common platforms, though we have more work to unleash the power of our data in service of our customers. We're simplifying and automating manual processes, and investing in tools and services needed to drive productivity and innovation velocity. This will reduce cost and complexity, improve the developer experience, and give more reasons for customers to choose PayPal. For example, we're converging to a single merchant reporting system so that our merchants will get consistent and accurate reports, which will make a huge difference in how they run their business. Another outcome of consolidating platforms is that we will now see one view of the customer, which allows us to more effectively cross sell the various products we offer.\nWe will be moving at lightning speed, with the weight of the company behind each of these initiatives, to deliver the best experiences possible for our customers this year. To wrap up, I am pleased with our fourth quarter results and the execution that the team delivered throughout the quarter amid an enormous amount of change. I'm excited about the year ahead and all the innovation we have in store for our customers. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jamie to take you through our results for the fourth quarter and full year.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Alex. Good afternoon. First, let me say that I'm very excited to have joined PayPal. Our new leadership team is laser focused on our customers, and I am incredibly energized to see our team come together to deliver PayPal's full potential. Before I discuss our financial results, you'll notice several things different in our materials today. First, we've redesigned our press release in a more standardized tabular format designed to allow ease of use and better consumption of information. We have also included additional supplemental metrics in our investor presentation, intended to provide greater transparency into our business. We will continue to evaluate these and other changes over time. I'll start with a summary of our financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we reported 9% revenue growth on a spot and currency neutral basis.\nFor the full year, revenue grew 8% at spot and 9% on a currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars were flat year over year in the fourth quarter and declined 1% for the full year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.48 in the quarter, representing 19% year over year growth. Higher earnings per share in the quarter were driven by ongoing expense discipline and better than expected transaction margin dollars, which benefited Branded Checkout , braintree, and interest on customer balances. We ended the full year with $5.10 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 24%. Our full year results benefited from lower operating expenses, the higher interest rate environment, and the impact of share buybacks. Now I'll walk you through some key operating metrics that support these results. We ended the year with 426 million active accounts and 224 million monthly active accounts.\nThroughout last year, we indicated that we expected ongoing churn of unengaged accounts in less developed markets, predominantly in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. This was the primary driver of our year-over-year reduction in total active accounts. We had modest growth in monthly active accounts, up 1% for both the quarter and the full year, and our active base of engaged accounts remained stable. More than 50% of our total active accounts were monthly actives over the course of 2023. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing twelve-month number, was 58.7 in the fourth quarter, up 14%. If we exclude PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, from that figure, transactions per active account grew 7%.\nPart of this growth rate is driven by the churn of unengaged accounts that I just mentioned, but we were also encouraged by the higher activity levels we're seeing among our core base of accounts. Page 14 in our investor presentation includes additional information on our historical trends in monthly active accounts and transactions per active account, excluding PSP processing. On volume growth in the fourth quarter, we saw total payment volume, or TPV, of $409.8 billion, representing 15% growth at spot and 13% growth on a currency neutral basis. This growth was driven primarily by Braintree, as well Branded Checkout and Venmo. US TPV grew 11%. International TPV grew 17% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in Europe and improvement in Asia. For the full year, TPV was $1.5 trillion, increasing 13% at spot and 12% on a currency neutral basis.\nPayPal's fourth quarter Branded Checkout volumes grew by approximately 5% on a currency neutral basis, bringing full Branded Checkout volume growth to 6%. We have seen a solid start to the year, with consistent Branded Checkout growth through January. PSP processing volumes grew 29% in the quarter, driven by ongoing growth in Braintree. The team continues to make product and performance enhancements for merchants. We are also putting greater discipline into our go to market and renewal processes as we focus on overall profitable growth. With respect to revenue, as I noted earlier, revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $8 billion. Transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.3 billion, driven by Braintree Branded Checkout . in the fourth quarter, US revenue grew 8%.\nInternational revenue increased 10% at spot and 12% on a currency neutral basis, accelerating from the third quarter. Similar to TPV, we saw ongoing strength in Europe and improvements in Asia. For the full year, US revenue grew 9%, and international revenue increased 7% at spot and 9% on a currency neutral basis. Other value added services revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a spot basis to $743 million. For the full year, other value added services revenue grew 26%, or by approximately $600 million. This growth was driven almost entirely by increased interest income on customer stored balances. Transaction take rate declined 10 basis points to 1.78% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 7 basis points of this decline was driven by lower gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue, and flat foreign exchange fees.\nIn addition, mix shift with higher volumes from large merchants continued to have a slight impact on Branded Checkout take rate. Transaction take rate for the full year was 1.76%, also down 10 basis points year over year. Transaction margin dollars were flat year over year in the fourth quarter compared to a 3.5% decline in the third quarter. This approximate 4.4 percentage point improvement was driven by a combination of the absence of merchant contractual compensation in the prior year period, and Branded Checkout and Braintree. The growth of interest income on customer stored balances, and growth Branded Checkout were the largest contributors to transaction margin dollars in the fourth quarter.\nThis growth was offset by the absence of hedge gains compared to the prior year period, as well as declines in other parts of the portfolio, including the impact of migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Fourth quarter transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 97 basis points, 4 basis points higher than the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by Braintree volume growth and was partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of PayPal volumes, and rate benefits in Venmo. Full year transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 94 basis points. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 7 basis points for the quarter, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter last year, and 8 basis points for the full year.\nCredit losses were $119 million for the quarter or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV, down 32% year over year, and 3 basis points as a rate of TPV for the full year. We have taken a prudent and active approach to managing our overall credit risk, tightening originations within our PayPal business loans portfolio, and externalizing our European Buy Now Pay Later portfolio in the fourth quarter. Non-transaction related operating expenses declined 9% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure. For the full year, the same expenses declined 11%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 11% in the quarter to nearly $1.9 billion, and for the full year by 14% to $6.7 billion.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.3% in the quarter and increased 110 basis points to 22.4% for the full year due to better operating expense leverage in each period. PayPal generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This includes a $1.7 billion net benefit from the sale of our European Buy Now Pay Later receivables to KKR, partly offset by the impact of new loans originated as held for sale. Adjusting for this impact, we generated nearly $800 million in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and $4.6 billion for the full year. Higher than expected changes in working capital and cash taxes had a negative impact on fourth quarter free cash flow in the quarter. We completed more than $600 million in share repurchases, bringing full year share repurchases to approximately $5 billion.\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $17.3 billion and debt of $11.3 billion. Before turning to our first quarter and 2024 guidance, I have two updates to our guidance approach to share. First, for the time being, we intend to move away from providing annual revenue guidance and instead provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. Given the considerable changes underway at the company, we believe it is prudent to guide revenue one quarter ahead and provide updates as the year progresses. Second, the first quarter and 2024 guidance that we're providing today excludes the impact of stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP results. This is consistent with our historical approach. Beginning in the first quarter, we will include stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. We will update our reporting and guidance accordingly at that time.\nStock based compensation is an integral part of our cost structure, and one that we believe we need to manage more directly and transparently. Including stock based compensation expense in our non-GAAP earnings will introduce more accountability and discipline, and will align our own performance measures to the way that many investors already evaluate our business. In terms of our outlook for the first quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 6.5% at spot and 7% on a currency neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter to grow at a mid single digit percentage with respect to our full year financial plan. As we have said previously, with all of the changes we are making, 2024 will be an execution year, and one where positioning the business for long term success will be critical.\nFor the full year, we are planning for a relatively consistent macroeconomic environment with some level of interest rate declines as we move through the year. We also assume that overall consumer spending and activity levels will remain relatively consistent. We expect full year 2024 non-GAAP EPS to be roughly in line with prior year EPS of $5.10. Underpinning our outlook, we expect roughly flat transaction margin dollars. Alex discussed our innovation and product enhancements earlier. Many of these are already in pilot or launch, but will require execution throughout the year before we begin to see impact. Our guidance includes minimal impact from these initiatives. We expect a low single-digit increase in non-transaction operating expense. As Alex mentioned, we announced actions last week to reduce cost, drive continued efficiencies, while at the same time investing more in our product, engineering, and platform teams to drive growth.\nThere are two factors to be mindful of that will impact our other value added services revenue. First, while we are still seeing benefit from the higher interest rate environment, we expect that this tailwind will be much less significant in 2024. Second, we continue to take an active and prudent approach to managing our credit exposure. We are carrying lower credit receivables after tightening originations last year. For our off balance sheet originations, we are planning for ongoing normalization in loss rates, which will impact the revenue share that we earn. We expect free cash flow for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion. From a financial policy perspective, we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating. Absent inorganic growth opportunities, we expect to continue allocating approximately 70% to 80% of our free cash flow to share buybacks.\nHowever, given our strong cash position as we enter the year, we are currently planning for at least $5 billion in share buybacks in 2024. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now hand it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you ask one question, then return to the queue if needed. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much. Appreciate all the details here. I wanted to dig in on the outlook for transaction margin dollars to be flat. Can you just give us a little bit more, maybe high-level thoughts on the key drivers there, and maybe some of the levers that are available to you to get the transaction margin dollar growth to accelerate beyond that in 2024? Get a lot of questions about it, obviously. I'd love to hear the puts and takes that you would underline for us. Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nSure.\nThank you, Tianjin. First, let me start just with recognizing how much change there is that we've gone through.\nYou heard it in my prepared remarks.\nWe essentially have a brand new executive leadership team. We've accelerated the pace of innovation. The first look experience you saw a couple of weeks ago really was innovation that could have taken months or years. I'm very proud of the team accelerating and getting it done in 60 days. We are at a point now where even our mindset shifts. This focus on profitable growth is something that's new for the organization, and we.\nAre grinding away every day.\nLet me unpack the components of transaction margin growth. The way I think about it is there's three levers there. The first is really around the branded experience. This is a proven experience for us. It's one that we, in some of the innovations that we put out, both for merchants that improve their experience as well as consumers with a new app that allows them to get through the experience better, that is a significant lever for us and one that, you know, to be honest, we've under invested in. You know, if I take just specifically the mobile experience for our consumers, it has been underwhelming and it's something that with the new innovations we just rolled out, I expect for us to be.\nAble to continue to see improvement there.\nThe second is around the unbranded processing. This is an area that we have invested significantly in with Fastlane. Now we have really, I believe, one of the best products in the market for our merchants. We're seeing the highest conversion rates out there, and it's something that our merchants are looking for and looking to adopt. We also are looking to move into new areas for growth that have higher margin opportunities, such as international and small business. It allows us to actually have different conversations with our customers and really.\nPrice to value the product.\nThe third is really what I'd consider a bucket of value added services. This is a combination of improving our flows with our consumers to ensure that we're attaching the products that we need to, whether it's Buy Now Pay Later or our PayPal Cashback Mastercard. These are flows that we've not optimized, and we're underperforming when it comes to really attach. Some of the new offerings that we rolled out, you saw our Advanced Offers Platform as well as Smart Receipts. These are all ways that we can monetize and improve the connection between our merchants and consumers. That's different ways I think about the components.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah.\nTianjin, I'll jump in on the 2024 specific puts and takes on transaction margin dollars. First, you heard us both say earlier that on the initiatives that Alex has been talking about, we have included limited impact on that in our guidance. If I pull back, really, we're viewing largely steady trends to what you saw last year, maybe in slightly different proportions.\nSo.\nBranded Checkout being a healthy contributor to growth. Improvement in our PSP margin profile, we expect some benefit in our interest income on customer balances, but really that should be much smaller than what we saw last year. We do expect some headwinds to our credit revenue, which as I think as I mentioned in the script on the call, with loss rate normalization happening to pre-pandemic levels and that trend starting to work, you know, we'll just see lower rev share from our partnerships in that space and then offsetting that. We really see also that some of our smaller product lines in the aggregate will be a drag on TM. This will be to a much lower extent than last year. In areas where we do platform consolidation, there are times we deprecate products to really push customers to new platforms.\ngood example of that is PPCP, where we do see some drop off, and we've got a few other products that, as you know, we have not invested as heavily as perhaps we should have in the last couple of years. As we work our way through that, there'll be some offset there.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Helpful. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to hone in on branded TPV growth a bit. I think it slowed by a point in the fourth quarter to 5%. Was hoping you could maybe take us through some of the monthly intra-quarter trends there, any market share observations you might have had from holiday season, and then just some general comments on what you're planning for on branded TPV growth in the first quarter and full year 2024.\nThank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks, Jason. Let me set the context, and I'll see if Jamie wants to pile on. You know, Branded Checkout performance was 6% for the year. It's been pretty, pretty consistent, and you know, for what we're looking going into next year, we're expecting it to be consistent as well. As we've talked about, that doesn't include, or includes minimal aspects of, the new innovations that we put out there. Let me talk about just some of the levers when it comes to the new innovations or ways that I think about Branded Checkout , because this obviously is going to be a big focus for the organization. The first is we really have to improve the value proposition for our consumers.\nThis is why you see us leaning into rewards, ensuring that we've got an improved experience that reduces latency, and really leaning in on mobile as well, so that our consumers have a Branded Checkout experience. Second, the acceleration of Fastlane when it comes to our merchants not only improves the unbranded opportunity, where we can see 70% of the customers that come through the Fastlane experience, but allows us to have a second engagement with our customers and bring them back into a branded experience at a later date. Show them all the different reasons why they should be using PayPal or getting a reward back for a purchase that they made. I think these again are just a couple of examples of innovations that we're leaning into now that allow us to really focus on that branded experience.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks Alex and Jamie.\nGuys, just to follow up a bit.\nOn some of this train of thought.\nI mean, I know you're mentioning you're not incorporating these new initiatives in your.\nTransaction profit growth thoughts for this year, but when we think about some of.\nThese, I mean, most of these, to your point, Alex, are going to be.\nBeneficial to gross profit growth.\nI guess we'd love to.\nHear a little bit more around what you'd measure as how you would measure.\nSuccess, whether it's the PPCP initiatives or.\nUnbranded as well as Branded Checkout experience. What KPIs should we look for?\nI guess a little bit more.\nOn timing, if not this year.\nWhen do you want investors to expect some traction in actual gross profit reacceleration?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, well, thank you, Darrin. Look, let me be clear. We are not putting in the expectations into the guidance until we see execution. We just think it's prudent for us to put points on the board before we put it into the guidance. That said, the teams are grinding on this every single day. We are having conversations with our merchants and introducing them. As I mentioned on the call, the reaction has been quite encouraging from the innovations. There is demand in the market, and we are starting right now. I will tell you the conversations that we're having now that we're focused on both innovations that are driving demand, as well as improvements for these merchants, are different than we've had in the past.\nI just want you to know we are working now on this, and we will update you as we start to see points on the board and adjust our guidance as needed. Secondly, back to your first question around how I think about this. Look, the thing I want you to take away from all of this innovation that we rolled out in first look is this is really changing the way we engage with our customers and our merchants. We are now creating experiences across the entire customer lifecycle, not just at checkout. We are driving not only a checkout improvement, the 50% improvement in latency, being able to improve Fastlane, but now we're starting to see a customer value proposition with CashPass giving rewards back to our customers so that they have a reason to choose PayPal at every purchase.\nWe're improving the onboarding and the reboarding as they come back into the app and start to now attach our Mastercard or debit experiences or Buy Now Pay Later. We're improving the post-purchase experience where we now have Smart Receipts or package tracking, so that we can improve the engagement between our merchants and our consumers. We now have an ongoing active use engagement, and we're leaning into demand generation and actually solving the biggest challenge that our merchants have, which is finding new customers as we think about our Advanced Offers Platform or creating shopper insights, so that our merchants can start to engage and personalize their experience through our data and through the AI that we can lean through.\nThe way I think about it is we are looking at the entire end-to-end experience, and we'll measure success through the metrics that you have. It's going to turn into what does transaction margin look like, what does active use look like from our ongoing users. That's how we'll think about it.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask a question about PayPal's commitment to durable, high-quality, profitable growth. You know, how does that impact the pricing strategy in Braintree? What unprofitable businesses and products will PayPal de-emphasize, and how does that tie into your 2024 non-transaction OpEx outlook of flat? Thank you very much.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nGreat, thanks, Mike. Let me talk about Braintree, then I'll have Jamie talk about potentially some of the other products and businesses. Let me take you back. Braintree, if you go back a few years ago, was really trying to establish.\nItself in the market.\nIt hadn't delivered at scale, and there were gaps in the product. We've invested heavily in the product and have really focused on some of the largest US enterprise customers, which now have proven the scale while we've gotten the product to parity. You look at what we just rolled out with innovations like Fastlane, and I think we've now leapfrogged the competition. What does that allow us to do? It allows us to be the one stop shop for merchants.\nIt allows us to provide a best-in-class experience on auth rates and give them the ability to have not only the best processing in an unbranded, but also package that with PayPal and with all the other ways that customers want to pay, including Buy Now Pay Later. We now are shifting towards being able to have a price-to-value conversation with our merchants and being able to really start to think about how we will ramp up go-to-market for not only Braintree but also PPCP. We also are now moving into markets that have higher margins. International and small business, with both Braintree and PPCP, allow us to now again price to value and have different conversations. That is how we think about it. We're not focused on unprofitable growth when it comes to Braintree.\nWe think we now have the profit product in market to be able to compete effectively and win.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, Mike, on the other part of your question, I guess what I'd say is we are just doing too many things, and our biggest opportunity is that we have to make decisions to stop things and to really focus. That gets into market competitiveness, it gets into pricing, it gets into really leaning into market opportunity, and really stopping doing things that prevent us from doing the right thing in those spaces. We are knee deep in that right now. When we talk about a year of transformation and execution, that's exactly what we're talking about.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Jamie.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi Alex and Jamie, thanks so much.\nFor taking my Alex.\nJamie, thanks so much for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask about how much leeway or opportunity you have to continue kind of taking out expenses while simultaneously.\nExecuting on the growth strategy.\nHow are you thinking about striking that balance, sort of cost control versus growth, and I guess how confident are you that.\nYou have room to do both?\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, I would say that is definitely an and not an or. That's exactly what we're doing with the workforce announcements we made a week ago, really taking that and putting that back into product, engineering, and marketing. We have got to invest deeply to grow this place, and it's really important for us to set the company up for the future. To do that, the innovation muscle, the commercial muscle means that right sizing our expense levels isn't going to be something that is a one and done. We know we have significant opportunity to continue to be more efficient, be that through automation, be that through driving deeper productivity. As we harvest that, that just gives us more levers to invest that are the right things for our profile as we go forward.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you so much, Jamie. Just a quick clarification, and I have a question for Alex. You said that starting from the first quarter you'll be including stock-based compensation in your non-GAAP rather than excluding it. Does that mean that, you know, if we just imagine that we fast forward a few months, the non-GAAP earnings would be reduced by roughly that $1.8 billion? Just looking for a little bit of clarification there. Alex, you made an interesting comment in terms of feeling like things are too big organizationally. I'm wondering how you're feeling about the tech stacks right now and the level of integration, and where we're at from that perspective in terms of your ability to drive the kinds of improvements and perhaps add functionality to improve the customer experience. Thanks.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, James, on your first question, you have it exactly right. Beginning in the first quarter, we'll start including stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP. Closer to that time, we'll do the look back where we'll provide, you know, the retrospective data so that we've got everything on a comparable basis. Yeah, you're thinking about that right.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nJames, on your question around the tech stack, look, I'll be transparent. The company has gone through significant growth over the last few years and a lot of acquisitions. We have not invested enough in creating a single platform. That again slows us down when it comes to innovation, and it slows us down when it comes to being able to leverage the data across the ecosystem. We are investing heavily in that now and starting to see real improvement.\nI mentioned a couple of things on the call, but really being able to put out a reporting system that now sees across the entire ecosystem, being able to see a single view of the customer so that now we can provide innovations to customers, but also actually be able to cross sell and be able to say, hey, this is a customer that has this risk profile and should be in these two or three different products, is a huge win for us as we start to consolidate. It also just accelerates our engineering velocity. Being able to have a services-based engineering team that can build once and deploy across the entire ecosystem is the.\nDirection that we're heading.\nYou started to see.\nThat.\nEven the innovations that we just put out over the last couple of weeks were not really possible without us investing heavily in the platform. I also would say we have a ways to go, so it is a primary focus for me and the organization and will drive velocity and efficiency.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon.\nA major regulatory change in payments just.\nWent through in Europe with Apple opening.\nUp its iOS and NFC chip for physical point of sale payments.\nWhat opportunity does this present to PayPal?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, David. We are tracking this closely. Apple is a great partner of ours, and our customers that love PayPal on the online e-commerce side are demanding being able to have an omnichannel and offline solution as well. We will be working closely on this, and when it is available, we will be ready to be able to deliver.\nFor our customers both online and offline.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you, Alex. One more on the initiatives, just trying to think through the prioritization of these additional investments you'll be making. You know, of those six initiatives, which do you think will sort of yield the returns quickest, and maybe a little bit more on timing of them. Maybe not 2024, but how early? Jamie, just a quick question on the interest rates. I think you mentioned you don't expect it to have a big impact or as big an impact in 2024, but is there an explicit rate forecast you have? Like, do you have lower rates in 2024? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings",
    "content2": "Thank you, Sanjay. You know, all of the innovations are incredibly exciting for us. Let me, on your question, the two that I am closely watching and our teams are executing on immediately is really a focus on the branded experience. This is both for the combination of merchants and consumers. Easing that experience for a customer to choose PayPal, have a reward that comes back to them, ensure that they're able to get through the experience with velocity, and checkout every time with PayPal is a huge focus for us. That's where we are driving a new app experience. Again, all of these innovations will be coming out over the next couple of weeks to months. We have to drive adoption, so that is having conversations with merchants, ensuring that they're upgrading to our latest innovations.\nThat's ensuring that we make it easy for them as well. That's why you've seen us launch a new developer portal. We're creating no code, low code experiences so developers can take the demand that they've shown because they have a best-in-class experience now and get it into market. Step one is I'm very focused on that branded experience. The second one is on the unbranded side, which is ensuring that Fastlane gets rolled out.\nThat to me starts to create an interesting network effect of us being able to have not only a branded experience, but for those consumers that pass a branded experience, whether it's ours or anyone else's, and want to just go through a guest checkout flow, we're able to identify them, we're able to help them and our merchants complete the transaction, and then we're able to have a follow-up conversation with that customer as well because they've gone through our fascinating experience. Those two, to me, we need to get rolled out. We need to get points on the board and show that it's driving outcomes. That is where I'm.\nMost focused on right now.\n\nJamie Miller\n\nCFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah. Sanjay, on the interest rates question, we do expect that the interest income on customer balances will have some growth this year, but really it'll be more first half focused. The second half, we do expect a series of rate cuts that is assumed in our macroeconomic scenario that underpins our guide, and that's why the second half should be much lighter on that front.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat is all the time we have for questions. I will turn it to Alex Chriss for closing remarks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nFantastic. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you all for joining us today. I want to reemphasize that 2024 is going to be a transition year focused on execution to position our business for long-term success. I'm excited with where we're positioned in the market, and I know that there. Is real opportunity to grow our role in commerce. We're driving the foundational and transformative changes that will set the company up for the future. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ryan Wallace, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Wallace\n\nHead of Investor Relations, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Alex Chriss, our President and CEO, and Gabrielle Rabinovitch, SVP and Acting CFO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast. Both the presentation and call are available on our investor relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties.\nThese statements include, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023, our planning assumptions for 2023, our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rates, operating margin impacts from our sale of loans to KKR, and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10K and quarterly report on Form 10Q filed with the SEC and available on our investor relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, 1 November 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information, and with that, let me turn the call over to Alex.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, Ryan. Thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you all on today's call, my first as President and CEO of PayPal. Before I dive in, I'd like to take a moment to thank my predecessor, Dan Schulman, for his diligence and professionalism in handing over the reins and helping me onboard quickly. Additionally, I'm very excited to welcome Jamie Miller to PayPal as the company's next Chief Financial Officer. Jamie will officially be joining PayPal on 6 November 2023. Jamie is a world-class CFO who joins us with decades of experience in both senior finance and operations roles at a number of different Fortune 100 and private companies, including GE and Cargill, and was most recently CFO of EY. Jamie is a vital addition to our team.\nUnder Jamie's leadership, I have no doubt that we will drive the financial discipline, necessary efficiencies, and operational excellence our company requires. I look forward to introducing Jamie to you over the coming months, and you will also hear from her, of course, on our next earnings call. As excited as we are to welcome Jamie, I also want to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to Gabrielle for all her hard work, dedication, and passion. As interim and then acting CFO, she's helped drive the company forward and has been instrumental in helping me get up to speed over the past couple of months. I truly appreciate her partnership as well as her commitment to PayPal, and look forward to working with her during this next chapter of PayPal's journey. Okay, let's jump in.\nWhen I was asked by the board to take on the CEO role, I was so energized by the possibilities of the impact PayPal can have on the world. I've dedicated the last 19 years of my career to fighting for the underdog, helping consumers and small businesses around the world achieve their dreams, interact with each other, and build a better life. PayPal takes that mission to a whole new level. The assets, the data, the scale, and the brand. The full foundation of what PayPal sits on today is unrivaled, and for me that is the opportunity of a lifetime. I am also walking in eyes wide open. There are clearly challenges to tackle. I am someone who speaks plainly and transparently. If we are doing things well, I will highlight them.\nIf there are things we can do better and need to fix, I will have no hesitation in calling those out too. Our innovation activity has accelerated, but we still have work to do on maximizing our impact for our customers and results. Competition and complexity have increased, and the company's focus has not been clear. We are doing a lot of things, but are we focused enough with our resource allocation? Are we executing with excellence behind the most important work to provide customers with a compelling and differentiated value proposition? Are we partnering with customers in a way that brings them deep value, but also rewards the PayPal shareholder? These are questions I am maniacally focused on answering with the team and doing a better job of executing across the board. Let me be clear, notwithstanding those realities, this is a growth company with great prospects.\nEven within the first month on the job, I am more energized and have more conviction and clarity than I expected over how we win. We have significant opportunities for growth and impact. The foundation is strong, and the value pools and growth vectors are there. We must simply execute better and with higher velocity. We will. I'd now like to share with you all my onboarding process and what I've learned and observed so far. I will describe changes you will see going forward, and lastly, I'll set expectations for what you will see from us over the next few quarters. While I have only been here a little over four weeks, I have been conducting in-depth conversations with internal and external stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, and investors, and diving into the business with our product and go-to-market teams.\nThe feedback has been encouraging, exciting, revealing, and very clear. There are two lenses I've had in synthesizing the input. First, how do we differentiate in solving the most critical customer problems? Second, what are our unique growth factors, and how do we accelerate our impact for customers and shareholders? Before I run through my thoughts after 30 days, let me say I've been surprised and delighted with how consistent and clear the answers to the previous questions have become. We are not searching for ideas for tremendous growth. Our assets and our position in the market are incredible. We know exactly what needs to be done. We simply must execute. To give you some additional context, here are a few of my initial observations on our employees. Our people are kind, caring, dynamic, innovative, and engaged.\nThey care deeply about our customers and one another, and are energized by our mission. My focus is to clearly define our mission, vision, and purpose, and unleash this team to execute a clearly defined and durable strategy. We will establish and refocus systems and processes to galvanize the entire organization behind our purpose and growth outcomes on our customers and innovation. I generally see our customers falling into three categories: consumers, small businesses, and large enterprises. When looking at our customers through this lens, each segment has unique assets and a multitude of growth opportunities. I've been encouraged by how much innovation our teams are delivering, but we have an opportunity to a focus our teams on what's most important to these customers, and b package our innovation in a way that is clear and differentiates us in the market. Let me give you some examples.\nFor consumers, we have not only tremendous breadth, mind share, and wallet share of our consumers, but these are active and engaged users. In the US alone, over 70% of the adult population has used PayPal in the past five years. Let me say that again, over 70% of adults in the US have used PayPal in the past five years, and with the recent launch of our Venmo Teen Account, we are now seeing adoption of our core products and services across the entire addressable market in the US. Additionally, we've innovated with unique products and experiences for consumers that each, on their own, provide tremendous customer benefit. For example, our PayPal Cashback Mastercard provides 3% cash back on PayPal purchases, as well as cash back on all other purchases.\nCustomers with this card make on average 56 more purchases with PayPal in the year after they adopt the product than they did the year before. Over 25 million consumers have used PayPal Rewards in the past 12 months, and we've put more than $200 million back into our customers' pockets with cash back and savings during that time. Even more interesting, through our rewards product, we have an active database of over 300 million SKUs of inventory from our merchant partners. These data points can help us use AI to power a robust shopping recommendation engine to provide more relevant rewards and savings back to our customers. We've just begun and already rolled out passkeys to more than 10 million consumers globally. To reduce friction in the sign-in experience, we've added additional security features by providing fraud alerts for all your cards in the PayPal wallet.\nWe're gaining ubiquity both online and in person as our PayPal and Venmo branded credit and debit cards can now be added in the Apple and Google wallets. We've launched the first regulated stablecoin by a global payments company in PYUSD, connecting our PayPal and Venmo ecosystems together and creating one of the most robust peer to peer networks in the world. Individually, these are each incredible innovations, but we have not yet brought them all together into a cohesive, integrated, and seamless customer experience and value proposition. As I said at the beginning, we have brand awareness and reach consumers in most markets around the world, they know PayPal, and they are rooting for us. It is our responsibility to now put together these innovations into a world-class, seamless experience. That is exactly what we're going to do.\nAs an example, we have refocused our consumer product and go to market team to relaunch a brand new end-to-end consumer experience with checkout at the center that will bring value to consumers with every single purchase. We will make it abundantly clear why choose PayPal. This is the first core priority I've asked the teams to focus on.\nNext. For small businesses, the core customer problem we can solve is helping them get more customers. From a breadth and depth perspective, we again have tremendous reach. We serve approximately 35 million merchant accounts, and the vast majority are SMBs. We have recently launched our new PayPal Complete Payments solution in the market. This solution helps small businesses sell globally and accept a range of payments, including PayPal, Venmo, and PayPal Pay Later products, to help drive checkout. We provide SMBs the tools to transact globally and are innovating for them with critical services, such as package tracking. Package tracking is now live with over 5,000 merchants on BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and Ultracart. Early results show merchants are experiencing an 80% decrease in item not received disputes, 40% higher dispute wins, and 65% faster funds release.\nThis is a good start, but what really gets me excited is how all of our profile and payment data comes together to empower each of our merchants to improve their conversion rates via our next generation checkout, while making our consumers' checkout experiences more efficient. We've just rolled this product out to a handful of pilot merchants, and with the breadth of our consumer coverage, we are able to identify the majority of consumers that visit a merchant's site. That means we can autofill payment information for consumers and streamline guest checkout for our merchants. To serve small businesses with our best-in-class product, we must get PayPal Complete Payments to scale globally. This is the second core priority.\nI have asked our product and go to market teams to rally behind, and you will see us with a concerted push to dramatically improve the end-to-end PayPal Complete Payments product rollout and adoption in the next couple of quarters. Once we've accomplished this, we will have earned the right to expand additional offerings to small businesses. As someone with deep experience scaling products and services for the small business segment, we have the right to play and win in a number of meaningful and durable businesses that will solve core customer problems and delight our users. Lastly, for our enterprise customers, we have proven that we can win in the market and take share with Braintree serving the largest enterprises such as Adobe, Booking.com, DoorDash, Ticketmaster, and Uber.\nIn the last 12 months, we processed over $450 billion in volume out of an estimated $4 to 5 trillion of global large enterprise e-commerce. That's approximately 10% flowing through us. We now have a beachhead to build upon. We will address additional customer needs such as payouts, fraud management, chargeback automation, and FX. These value-added services not only address specific customer pain points, but also help PayPal drive additional margin. To be clear, our focus here will be continuing to improve performance, provide additional services, and expand margin. Lastly, on our company as a whole, let me touch briefly on our evolution to operating as a platform company. Our ability to seamlessly delight customers end to end is a function of the quality of our technology and data platforms, which are very strong.\nWe have a significant and important opportunity to further become a platform company that builds company-wide capabilities, accelerates at scale, and drives efficiencies across the organization. Fully unlocking this will accelerate innovation velocity in the market and value. Further, our data and scale are key strengths. Our machine learning capabilities combine hundreds of risk and fraud models with dozens of real-time analytics engines and petabytes of payments data to generate insights by learning users' behaviors, relationships, interests, and spending habits. This scale gives us a very unique advantage in the market. Our ability to create meaningful profiles with the help of AI is exceptionally promising. You will see us using our data and the advances in generative AI in responsible ways to further connect our merchants and consumers together in a tight flywheel. This is essential.\nWe must build products and customer experiences that are strengthened by our unique two-sided network. Harnessing an end-to-end data platform will help us drive network effects throughout our business. In order to maximize this opportunity, it will require technology consolidation and automation across the company. Simply put, our cost base remains too high, and it's actually slowing us down. As such, I am in the process of evaluating our most profitable growth priorities and aligning our resources to those priorities. We will become leaner, more efficient, and more effective, driving greater velocity, innovation, and impact for customers. To recap my observations and focus areas, our assets and breadth are unrivaled.\nOur innovation is accelerating and will drive impact, but we must focus and execute. The weight of the organization will be squarely behind, one, reinventing our consumer experience to drive a clear and durable value proposition with checkout at the center, two, improving and scaling PayPal Complete Payments for small businesses globally, and three, driving margin expansion in Braintree and other products for large enterprises. Additionally, we will invest in our company-wide platform by driving efficiency and acceleration of innovation while right-sizing our expenses. Now I'd like to share what you can expect from me in terms of how we will communicate to all of you and the principles to which we will adhere. You'll see this starting with our next earnings call in terms of how we report our numbers and what we view as important metrics to our shareholders.\nI believe in the last several years it has been difficult to model our company consistently because the company itself hasn't provided consistent metrics to allow you to do so. That is going to change for our next earnings call. We will unpack for you the following. First, we will be clear what our operating principles are, and how these principles drive the growth opportunities we pursue, and in turn drive capital allocation, technology allocation, and talent allocation decisions across our business. Second, we will be clear about what metrics matter the most to us and how we are managing the business. I can tell you right now what I care about most is high quality customer growth and profitable revenue growth. Going forward, PayPal will be focused on generating real profit for the company. I can't emphasize that last statement enough.\nIt is key to how I believe this company should be run, and it is how you should expect us to measure our performance. Unprofitable growth is counterproductive to the long-term prospects of this or any other growth-oriented company. Third, as a management team, we will be guided by margin-accretive revenue growth over time. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to grow revenue outside of purely transaction-related volume as we continue to serve our customers' core needs. We are taking a closer look at how best to report our financial performance and which KPIs we will be focused on going forward. Once we complete this review, we will consistently use the same metrics, and it will be easy for you to model the business, judge our performance, and hold us accountable.\nNext, I want all stakeholders to be able to understand in a simple way how we do what we do and how we make money doing it. This includes our customers, as they are the lifeblood of our existence. Lastly, I am laser focused on operating leverage and making sure we manage our cost base with relentless attention and commitment. As I said before, I believe our cost base and complex structure is slowing us down. We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth while reducing our expenses, helping further drive operating leverage. In terms of a timeline, from here I can tell you that we are already hard at work determining a comprehensive plan for 2024 and ensuring we are prepared to deliver it. There are teams stacked against the focus areas I mentioned earlier, and they are deep in execution mode.\nOur core execution and fast twitch operating muscles are building by the day. In parallel, the leadership team and I are refreshing our strategic priorities and focus areas for 2024, and we'll be sharing them with you in our next earnings call in February. I will unpack for you then the clarity of our strategic focus, our focused growth priorities, and how we will achieve durable, profitable growth, adjustments we will make to drive efficiencies across the organization, and guide what you can expect us to deliver in 2024. It is clear to me that the things we need to do better are not all going to be achieved overnight. Of course, business, like life, is not a straight line. However, I can tell you one thing for sure, we are going to move at lightning speed to get there as quickly as possible.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call over to Gabrielle to take you through the Q3 results, and then we'd be happy to take some questions.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Alex. It's great to have you on board. The past few weeks have been incredibly inspiring and invigorating. There's renewed energy and excitement at PayPal with you leading us forward. I look forward to welcoming Jamie and working with you as we enter this new chapter of growth for PayPal. I share Alex's enthusiasm for our increased pace of innovation, and the outstanding opportunities we have given the power and scale of our global franchise. I agree that with increased focus and improved prioritization, accelerating our growth and delivering operating leverage are mutually reinforcing. Importantly, we're committed to increased transparency and improved consistency in how we discuss our business, and the ongoing enhancement of our disclosures. I would also like to thank the entire PayPal team for their steadfast focus on delivering for our customers and executing our priorities. First, several highlights from the quarter.\nWe're reporting 9% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis, and 20% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, both of which are ahead of our guidance. In the third quarter, we again demonstrated strong expense discipline and our ability to operate our business with improved efficiencies. In addition, we continued to make progress in the quarter across our long-term strategic initiatives, which are focused on driving more profitable growth moving to our customers. We're encouraged by new cohorts coming in. Retention and active use based on product innovations are starting to pay off. That said, during the quarter, active accounts declined by 2.8 million as we continue to flush out low-quality customers, predominantly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. As a reminder, we said this would be a year where we churn off lower-quality actives and in which total accounts would decline.\nYear to date, churn has been lower than our expectations. Customer growth is a vital pillar of our growth agenda. We're an organization focused on serving our customers and improving our value proposition, and we're positioning ourselves for a return to growth in our customer base. Turning to volume growth, we're reporting total payment volume of $387.7 billion, representing 15% growth at spot and 13% growth on a currency neutral basis, with that growth primarily driven by Braintree. US TPV grew 10%. International TPV grew 19% currency neutral, accelerating five points sequentially, primarily driven by strength in Europe as well as improvement in Asia. I would now like to comment on our branded checkout performance. PayPal's global branded checkout volumes grew approximately 6% in the quarter on a currency neutral basis, relative to 7.5% growth in Q3 last year.\nGrowth accelerated in July to 8% but moderated as we move through the quarter to date. In Q4, branded trends have stabilized and are tracking in line with the first half of the year. As I mentioned, revenue increased 9% on a currency neutral basis, and 8% at spot to $7.4 billion. Transaction revenue grew 7% to $6.7 billion, driven by Braintree and PayPal. Branded checkout hedge gains for the quarter were $7 million, $149 million lower than Q3 last year. In Q3 of last year, we also benefited from approximately $75 million in contractual compensation for merchants, which did not contribute to our revenue this year. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services was also a drag on the growth in transaction revenue.\nOther value added services revenue grew 25% to $764 million, almost entirely driven by increased interest income on customer stored balances. In the third quarter, US revenue grew 7%. International revenue increased 10% at spot, and 11% on a currency neutral basis, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year. As with TPV, we saw strengthening performance across Europe, which was most pronounced in the early to mid summer, and in China our seller business improved as well. Transaction take rate declined 13 basis points to 1.72%, similar to our Q2 results. Approximately 70% of this decline was driven by, one, lower gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue; two, a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility; and three, the headwind from lapping elevated contractual compensation for merchants last year.\nIn addition, the mix of volumes from large merchants continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate. Our total take rate declined 12 basis points to 1.91% and was affected by the same factors as transaction take rate. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 93 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q3 last year. This increase was primarily driven by Braintree volume growth and was partially offset by the geographic mix of PayPal volumes and rate benefits. In Venmo, transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points. For the quarter, flat to last year, credit losses were $117 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 21% in the third quarter.\nConsistent with our expectations going into the quarter, Q3 saw a higher level of pressure on transaction margin, dollar, and rate performance due to several lapping and more transitory factors that we've discussed on past earnings calls. Transaction margin dollars declined 3.5% to $3.4 billion, and transaction margin declined 558 basis points to 45.4%. In the third quarter, we delivered 540 basis points of operating expense leverage. Non-transaction related operating expenses declined 12%. We've been actively managing our cost structure, and in Q3, reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories contributed significant leverage. Non-GAAP operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $1.6 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin declined 18 basis points to 22.2%, with operating expense leverage largely offsetting transaction margin compression. For the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 20% to $1.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.06.\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $15 billion. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, which represents a 30% decline from the third quarter last year. As a reminder, last quarter we classified the European installment loans that we intended to sell to KKR as held for sale. All loans subsequently originated in this portfolio are also classified as held for sale and are reflected as outflows within cash flow from operations. In Q3, this dynamic reduced free cash flow by $810 million. In future periods, we will recognize the cash from proceeds of sales as an offsetting inflow to cash flow from operations. Adjusting for this temporary impact, free cash flow grew 21% to $1.9 billion. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation are competitive differentiators and provide us with significant optionality for value creation.\nWe have also made progress this year executing a disciplined approach to capital allocation and managing our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we completed an additional $1.4 billion in share repurchases through 30 September 2023. We've now returned $4.4 billion to shareholders for the full year. We continue to expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our share repurchase program. Given our conviction in our business relative to its valuation today, we've taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program and have reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by 7% over the last eight quarters. We believe that share repurchase remains an optimal use of capital, allowing us to retain the flexibility to continue investing opportunistically in our business.\nIn addition, as a result of our decision to sell our European Pay Later receivables to KKR, we ended Q3 with $5 billion in net credit receivables, a 16% decline year-over-year, and a 9% decline sequentially. Two weeks ago, we closed on the first step of this commitment, receiving approximately $1.4 billion in proceeds. Later this month, we will close on the next tranche of our back book sale of credit receivables. We are also maintaining a tightened origination strategy for the PayPal business loans portfolio. Principal and interest receivables declined nearly 30% in the quarter, and this portfolio now represents approximately 12% of our overall credit receivables portfolio versus 21% 12 months ago. As you heard from Alex, we're evaluating our growth priorities and aligning our resources to accelerate our velocity. With greater focus, we can be more effective. Consistent with this approach, we're divesting Happy Returns.\nIn September, we entered into an agreement to sell Happy Returns to UPS for $465 million in cash, meaningfully higher than our acquisition price. We're thrilled that following a rigorous process over many months, our team was able to find Happy Returns the right long-term home with UPS. This sale, which is expected to close in the current quarter, will enable us to put even more focus on our core business and priorities. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Relative to the plan laid out on our earnings call three months ago, branded checkout growth has been lower than expected. As I mentioned earlier, after an acceleration in the summer, we've seen a return to growth that is more in line with trends throughout the first half of 2023.\nWe now expect fourth quarter revenue to grow between 7% and 8% on a currency neutral basis, or approximately 6% to 7% at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP EPS in Q4 to be approximately $1.36, representing 10% growth relative to 2022. Our guidance contemplates a sequential improvement in transaction margin dollar performance. That said, on a year-over-year basis, we now expect transaction margin dollars to decline. In addition, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to contract from the fourth quarter last year. For 2023, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 8.5% on a currency neutral basis and approximately 7.5% at spot. The ongoing strength of Braintree volumes, in conjunction with lower than expected Branded Checkout trends, are resulting in incremental pressure on our non-GAAP operating margin.\nRelative to the 100 basis points of expansion previously expected, we now expect approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion. We're slightly increasing our expectations for full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS, which we now expect to be approximately $4.98, representing 21% growth from last year. This increase reflects the benefit of Q3 outperformance, and changes to our tax rate assumption. In addition, we now expect free cash flow for 2023 to be at least $4.6 billion. In closing, we believe that we're well positioned to navigate the road ahead. As Alex noted in his comments, we're working on our plans to accelerate profitable growth, and we'll share our progress with you along the way with consistency and transparency. We're committed to building PayPal for the future, and guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers. Backdrop continues to be complex.\nWe're taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business, and with that, Alex and I are happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and then return to the queue. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks so much, and Alex, appreciate your observations and priorities here. Can you maybe share a little bit more on your early impressions of the assets and the portfolio products at PayPal? I'd just love to hear what surprised for the upside and maybe what assets could require more work to turn around than what you thought. If, for example, Happy Returns being sold as you called out last week, we see more sales, divestitures, replatforming, that kind of thing. Thank you.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thank you, Tien-tsin, and good to hear from you. You know, it's been exciting to come in. I would be remiss if I didn't say this wasn't a surprise, but has delighted me from an asset perspective. The first I'd highlight is our employee base.\nThis is a tremendous team that is energized, has welcomed me to the team, and is fired up to go tackle all the opportunities ahead of us. You know, if I think about the different components, I've been really impressed with all the different pieces that we have to deliver for consumers. We have a ubiquitous platform that's globally recognized with PayPal, Venmo is a verb, and it's something that is tremendous in the US and has opportunities beyond. If I think about all the different core problems that we can solve with the assets that we have for customers—rewards, buy now, pay later, cash back cards—all of those are tremendous and within our grasp. We just, as I mentioned earlier, just have to put them together into a core value proposition, and that's what the team's working towards right now.\nOn the merchant side, again, we have tremendous penetration into small businesses and enterprises. We have a beachhead now with Braintree, which I'm really excited about. I think we've earned the right now to expand margin and make sure that we're really pricing to value, ensuring that we're delivering what we need to across the board. If I really think about the biggest surprise that I didn't realize before coming in, it is probably around the data. When we look at the data that we have across this two sided network, it allows us to do things that I think others just can't.\nWhen I think about how we can personalize branded checkout, how we can recognize people at checkout with our data and create an experience that is frictionless, that is personalized, that drives conversion for our merchants, I think we're just scratching the surface of the opportunity there. That is a big opportunity that gets me very excited in terms of opportunities where we have more work. I think you saw it with the Happy Returns divestiture, and what I would say overall is we have lots of opportunities, but we're doing too many things, we're spread too thin, and we have an opportunity to focus the organization on what matters the most, on the most impactful opportunities to customers, and to growing the business. We'll be looking at that over time.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi Alex and Gabrielle, and appreciate all the clarity you guys provided on your priorities. You gave us some great detail also on your approach to the SMB side of the business, such as some commentary on PPCP. I guess the question is, given your prior experience with SMBs, do you see SMB becoming a more important part of PayPal's strategy relative to the past? I guess which areas of the product or innovation roadmap get you most charged up at this point?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah. Thank you, Ramsey. Small businesses are a passion of mine. It has been for the last 19 years, and you know, it's very personal. I used to run a small business, and so it's in my DNA and something that not only is important to PayPal and has been in the past, it's really been the lifeblood of the organization. It absolutely will be a priority going forward. You know, when I think about small businesses in general, there are two really core customer challenges that small businesses have. The first is getting customers and growing their business, and the second is managing cash flow. On the getting customer side, we have a tremendous opportunity with PPCP to help them convert customers, to find customers, to drive new customer acquisition, and really help them over time. This is a data play, it's a ubiquity play.\nWith our two sided network, it's where we're focused right now. Once we do that, I think we earn the right to expand into their second challenge of cash flow. Cash flow is all about money in, money out, and access to capital. We play in all three of those areas. We just have to put together the assets that we have to be able to help small businesses again manage their cash flow in a way that helps them grow their business and get past any ups and downs in the market. Very excited about small businesses going forward.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nFantastic. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Alex, congrats again on the new role, and Gabrielle, thanks for everything. Obviously, we know you'll be missed by your investors. I know you lowered your outlook a bit for revenue in fourth quarter, and I think you said you continue to see a decrease in gross profit for fourth quarter. Can you just give us a bit more color on what you're seeing in the environment on e-comm, both US and perhaps globally, and just if anything you're seeing in the trends is what led to a more cautious outlook, either on the holidays or anything more broadly. Thanks, guys.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, Darrin. You bet. Thanks for the question. Overall, I'd say we're seeing very healthy trends in our checkout business. We're heading into the heart of Q4, and we really see no meaningful shifts in our performance or our demand environment. We have taken an appropriately prudent approach to planning for Q4, and obviously we've contemplated a range of outcomes. As you know, headed into Q3, we had expected to see Branded checkout accelerate through the back half. Branded did bump up in July, and as I discussed a few minutes earlier, it moderated through Q3. Overall, we've seen very solid performance in Branded. When we think about what we're seeing in the back half relative to the first half, very consistent performance in global Branded checkout, but it's just not as elevated as we'd planned. That's really what's informing the outlook.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Thanks, Gabrielle.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Eng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMike Eng\n\nSenior Software Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. First, Alex, congratulations on the new role. Gabrielle, thanks for everything. I appreciate your comments around managing the cost base and it being too high. Could you talk a little bit about how you think about balancing the need for investment versus efficiency? The company previously talked about the opportunity for OpEx to keep declining in the years ahead. Is that how we should still think about the future? Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks, Mike. You know, first, let me say, as I mentioned earlier, this is a growth company, and we are going to assess the focused priorities where we will invest in growth, and we will make sure those are funded for success. I think about that separately than also being able to manage OpEx. On the expense side, we have an opportunity to continue to manage OpEx efficiently.\nWe have a lot of acquisitions that we've done over the past few years. We have a lot of duplication and a lot of manual work that we have an opportunity to invest in automation. We have an opportunity to invest in a platform that allows us to build services that can be reused and leveraged across the organization, which will, again, as I mentioned earlier, actually accelerate us and speed the company up. I think about them differently. We will absolutely invest in growth and make sure that the levers that we have to continue to delight customers and grow the business are funded for success. We will work on building a platform that drives automation and continues to drive down our cost base.\n\nMike Eng\n\nSenior Software Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Alex, welcome. Gabrielle, best of luck. I wanted to actually ask about the transaction profit, dollar growth in Q4. Will that year-over-year decline be more or less than it was in Q3? How should we think about the potential for this metric to see improved growth into 2024? Maybe you can comment on which of the initiatives that are in place offer more potential than others to move the needle on transaction profit, dollar growth next year. Thank you.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet, Jason. Maybe I'll start. Well, as you heard Alex discuss and I commented as well, our focus really is on driving profitable growth, and we're putting the weight of the organization against initiatives consistent with that objective. That said, we did see a decline in our Q3 transaction margin dollars. We do expect them to decline again in Q4, but to a lesser extent. I really view Q3 as the low point, and we'd expect to see an improvement in the profile in Q4. In addition, obviously we're not guiding 2024 on this call. Longer term, our success will in part be determined by our ability to reaccelerate profitable growth in the business, and we expect to be able to do that. Alex, anything else you want to add?\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYou know, I just want to underscore. I know I said it in the comments, and I just want to underscore it again. We have every opportunity to drive profitable growth. It's just a focus and a discipline that we will bring to the organization. It will take time. There will be a sequential performance improvement over a number of quarters. When we make it the focus of the organization, we have enough levers at our disposal to be able to deliver on that.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much for the question. I want to add my welcome to Alex and thanks to Gabrielle for all the work she's done in the CFO seat. One of the assets that you talked about within that population of the US is Venmo. I'm wondering how you're thinking about expanding its acceptance and kind of the to do's around that. It seems like it's really important. Demographically, you have at least a foothold at Amazon, but expansion of acceptance elsewhere, online especially, has been pretty slow. Just wondering how you're thinking about that as part of the asset pool and the to do list there. Thanks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thank you James for the question. You know, it is pretty rare to be able to have an asset as powerful as Venmo when something again becomes a verb. Language is a tremendous demographic. You know, you saw with our launch of Venmo Teen, we continue to expand the opportunity set there. You know, as you mentioned, we're in early stages with Amazon. That is going well, and we expect that both from a customer demand perspective, as well as a merchant demand perspective, we will continue to drive acceptance ubiquity for Venmo. I think that is very important for us, as well as just driving additional services that our customers are demanding for the Venmo app. Again, as we think about providing different services, expanding the opportunity for our customers to be delighted and use Venmo for all aspects of their spending and managing of money, I think we're just again scratching the surface of what's possible with an app that is clearly loved in the market and has created viral growth.\nVery excited to accelerate investment there and see where we can take that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I will now turn the conference over to Alex Chriss for closing remarks.\n\nAlex Chriss\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nGreat. Thank you, Krista, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Hopefully, you can see how serious we are about growing and improving PayPal across the board as quickly as possible. Before we close, I want to leave you with three thoughts you've heard in my voice today. Both a confidence that we will make this company excel, and a determination to do it as quickly and thoroughly as possible. We have an excellent business, but it needs to execute better and with greater clarity and focus. It will. We will impact the go-to-market strategy and financial focus of the company in ways that are immediately impactful. It won't happen overnight, but we will get PayPal to the kind of consistent growth profile we all expect.\nAs I've said already, it bears repeating one last time, what I care about is profitable growth that is going to be our true north and receive our total focus. I've spent my entire career focusing on making sure we delight our customers and solve their most critical problems. We must ensure we serve all our stakeholders, and lastly, our employee base is fired up and motivated to win in the market. In addition, you can also expect us to add additional senior talent to our team, who I believe can help significantly accelerate our growth trajectory. We are future proofing this business, and we know what needs to be done. We are playing to win in the weeks and months ahead. We are going to be moving with velocity to deliver for our customers and our business.\nI look forward to talking to you all on our next call in February, and laying out our clear plan to win. Thank you, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our investor relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties.\nThese statements include, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023, our planning assumptions for 2023, our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rates, operating margin, impact from our sale of loans to KKR, and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10K and quarterly report on Form 10Q filed with the SEC and available on our investor relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, 2 August 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Gabs, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. I'm proud of the PayPal team as we delivered another solid quarter. Revenues came in above the top end of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS grew 24% to $1.16, in line with the midpoint of our guide. We are reiterating our guidance for non-GAAP EPS and operating margin expansion for the full year. Encouragingly, E Commerce growth appears to have stabilized in the mid-single digits, substantially above our estimates when we entered 2023. Our branded checkout volumes grew roughly in line with the industry in Q2 and accelerated to nearly 6.5% growth in the month of June. In July, our branded checkout volume growth accelerated again to over 8%, our highest monthly growth rate since the end of the pandemic.\nWe expect branded checkout volumes will strengthen throughout the back half of the year, supported by traction from our key strategic initiatives. Of course, we still face a fluid global macroeconomic environment. However, it is quite encouraging to see core inflation rates continue to come down. As inflation cools, we would expect to see discretionary spending rise, which we believe will support, and possibly accelerate, the overall growth of E Commerce spending. As a market leader in digital payments, any uptick in E Commerce will accelerate our growth. Revenues in Q2 grew by 8% on a currency neutral basis to approximately $7.3 billion. It is instructive to note that we are lapping certain items that provided an outsized benefit to us in Q2 and Q3 last year. Consequently, those items pressure our revenue growth rate by approximately 1.25% in each of those quarters this year.\nExcluding these items, our growth in Q2 would have been between 9% and 10%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect our revenue growth in the second half of the year to be roughly the same as, and given recent trends, may be a bit better than, the first half. We expect Q3 revenues to grow approximately 8% on a currency neutral basis. I would highlight that July was a very strong start to the quarter, with currency neutral revenue growth of 9% and TPV growth accelerating into the low teens. For the year, we anticipate our revenue growth to be between 9% and 10% on a currency neutral basis. We continue to exercise good discipline in managing operating expenses for the quarter. Non-GAAP non-transaction related expenses fell 11% year-over-year.\nAs a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.4%, up approximately 230 basis points from a year ago. We expect to increase our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year by at least 100 basis points. As we look ahead to the rest of 2023 and into 2024, we expect to drive meaningful productivity improvements. Our initial experiences with AI, and continuing advances in our processes, infrastructure, and product quality, enable us to see a future where we do things better, faster, and cheaper. These overall cost savings come even as we significantly invest against our three strategic priorities. We know exactly what we need to do as we look towards 2024, and as you can see in our results, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor.\nWe understand that over the medium to long term we need to deliver growth in our transaction margin dollars to ensure we sustainably grow our earnings, and we are beginning to see clear signs that our initiatives will yield notable traction against that objective over the next several quarters. As I mentioned, we expect our top line to accelerate to low double-digit growth by Q4. We expect transaction margin dollars to increase, while our operating expenses continue to create significant leverage that, in connection with our share buybacks, enables us to target low to mid-teens EPS growth for the remainder of 2023, even as we begin to lap the increases we enjoyed on our interest income. I'd like to now turn to our three strategic priorities in which we are investing our resources and energy: brand at checkout, our PSP merchant solutions, and our digital wallets.\nAs I've mentioned in the past, all three of these are critical and interrelated. They are essential for us to increase our share of the e commerce market, as well as accelerate our margin dollar growth. As we discussed in our June investor meeting, we are meaningfully accelerating new product innovations into the market, scaling our A/B testing, and significantly improving our time to market. We are now consistently delivering against our roadmap on schedule. This is the result of significant investments in our platform infrastructure and tools, an enhanced set of measurements and performance indicators, hiring new talent, and early successes using AI in our software development process. We continue to ramp our test velocity, with more than 300 experiments launched across our product experiences in the first half of the year.\nEvery successful test leads to incremental customer benefits, and the cumulative effect of those changes leads to noticeable improvements in our key metrics, including the gains we are seeing in branded checkout growth. For instance, our Buy Now Pay Later traction has meaningfully accelerated with the introduction of pre-approved amounts to our consumers. Our work in onboarding and onboarding new experiences has driven new monthly cohorts with higher engagement and lifetime value. This month we are expanding the rollout of passkeys in the US and Europe, which will greatly simplify the branded checkout login experience and drive improved authorization rates that will further extend our lead over our competitors. Our goal is to continually close the gap in our login and checkout experiences every quarter and to be equal to or better than any competitor within the next year.\nWe simultaneously aim to drive differentiated wallet experiences across both PayPal and Venmo. We believe that only those companies with unique and scaled data sets will be able to fully utilize the power of AI to drive actionable insights and differentiated value propositions for their customers. We are already experimenting internally with an AI-driven PayPal Assistant. We envision that a version of this will be part of our consumer app, and we plan to introduce it later this year. We continue to see impressive traction in our PSP business, with our growth rates nearly 30% on a currency-neutral basis. Many of the largest tech companies in the world are now either using our Braintree capabilities or are in deep strategic negotiations with us to do so.\nWe are in the process of rolling out high-margin value-added services, expanding internationally, and making noticeable progress with in-person payments. We continue to receive exceptional interest in our next-generation checkout solution, which will leverage the scale of our network vault, our deep understanding of our two-sided network, and the development of proprietary AI models. I couldn't be more pleased with the initial rollout of PayPal Complete Payments, our PSP merchant solution for channel partners and the SMB market. We are seeing tremendous interest in the platform, with a substantial pipeline of completed sales and a backlog of deals that continues to grow. Importantly, our major channel partners are enthusiastic about its capabilities. We have already implemented PPCP with leading channel partners like Adobe, Lightspeed, Recurly, Shift4, Shopify, Stacks Payments, Ultracart, Wix, and WooCommerce.\nWith more than 25 additional channel partners scheduled to be live by the end of the year, this not only demonstrates the strength of our platform capabilities, but will also enable a meaningful number of SMB merchants to access our latest checkout experiences. There is a remarkable sense of energy, excitement, and enthusiasm among our leadership teams as we see clear and distinct signs of reinvigorated success in the market. We are now able to take advantage of many of the investments we have made over the past years to deliver a best-in-class experience for our customers, leveraging a modern infrastructure and our scale in the age of AI. We have successfully recruited a large number of external talent to complement our internal teams in both AI and machine learning, as well as throughout our product, engineering, and technology groups.\nIn order to build upon our success and maximize our opportunity, I'd like to end my remarks talking about our CEO succession plan. We are in the very final stages of the process with several outstanding candidates, all of whom are highly qualified and excited to lead PayPal as we go into our next chapter of growth. I'm eager to welcome PayPal's next CEO, to work with them on a seamless onboarding, and to support them and the amazing PayPal team as I transition to my role on the board. As you can hopefully tell, we have a lot of energy and confidence that we are on the right path, with good momentum. Many of the headwinds we faced are now turning into tailwinds, we are executing with a high degree of excellence.\nWe have a firm handle on our business model and can point to numerous successes already making a real difference in the market, which will only continue to compound over time. PayPal is in an increasingly strong position, and we are poised to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you, and with that, let me turn the call over to Gabrielle.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serving our customers and executing our priorities. PayPal delivered another solid quarter in a dynamic environment. We're reporting revenue at the high end of our guidance range, and earnings per share consistent with our expectations. Our results are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations. We continue to invest in our key initiatives while demonstrating discipline in delivering on our operating expense commitments. In June, we were delighted to share more about our long-term strategic plan and product roadmap at our investment community meeting. Importantly, the product launches we discussed are on track, and we continue to gain conviction in our ability to accelerate our branded checkout volumes and drive greater profitability across our PSP services.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to announce a multi-year agreement to sell both our existing European Buy Now Pay Later receivables, as well as future originations, to KKR. During my remarks, I will discuss the impact of this externalization on our financial results. We have also included additional details in our Investor Update presentation. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis and 7% at spot to $7.3 billion. Transaction revenue grew 5% to $6.6 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and PayPal branded checkout.\nHeadwinds to growth in the quarter included the lapping of $75 million in contractual compensation from merchants last year, which was de minimis this year, $72 million less in hedge gains relative to Q2 last year, and the impact from migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Other value-added services revenue grew 37% to $731 million. This performance was predominantly due to increased interest income on customer stored balances, and to a lesser extent, revenue growth from consumer credit products. In the second quarter, US revenue grew 9%, and international revenue increased 5% on a currency-neutral basis. International revenue increased 7%, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year. Transaction take rate declined 11 basis points to 1.74%. Approximately 2/3 of this decline was driven by a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility.\nA decline in gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue, and the headwind from lapping elevated contractual assessments for merchants last year. While merchant mix continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate, the second quarter was an improvement from Q1. Our total take rate declined 6 basis points to 1.94%, affected by the same factors as transaction take rate. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 94 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q2 last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in Braintree volumes, partially offset by rate benefits in core PayPal and Venmo. Overall, transaction expense dollars grew 16%. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, a 3.6 basis point improvement versus last year. Transaction loss dollars declined 25%.\nThe decrease this year was primarily due to an atypical merchant insolvency last year, which drove a sizable loss in the second quarter with no comparable exposure this year. Our ongoing risk mitigation activities and mix of volumes also contributed to this performance. Credit losses were $112 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV on a dollar basis. Credit losses increased 65%. Provisions in the quarter were driven by a build of $146 million, partially offset by a $33 million reserve release from the reclassification of our European Buy Now Pay Later portfolio to Held for Sale from Held for Investment. The operating income benefit from this release of reserves was entirely offset by the fair value discount on the portfolio classified as Held for Sale.\nThe increased provisioning resulted from increased expected losses in our PayPal business loans portfolio, as well as growth in our US pay later portfolio. Like the broader industry, we're seeing a normalization of our credit portfolio to pre-Covid delinquency levels across our consumer and PayPal working capital portfolios. That said, we have seen some deterioration in our business loans portfolio. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net credit receivables, and as we discussed last quarter, we have taken remedial actions to address this performance. We've tightened originations and have already seen improvement in new cohorts. We'll be managing the book with similar rigor as we move through the remainder of the year.\nAs a result of designating $1.9 billion in pay later receivables to assets held for sale, we ended Q2 with $5.5 billion in net credit receivables, a 3.5% decline year-over-year, and a 26% decline sequentially. The decline in receivables due to held for sale accounting also contributed to an increase in our reserve coverage ratio. This ratio increased to 10% from 7.8% in Q1. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 13% in Q2 relative to an increase of 30% in the second quarter of 2022. Transaction margin dollars grew 1% to $3.3 billion, and transaction margin was 45.9%. While our transaction margin declined in the quarter, the rate of decline slowed considerably from both Q1 and the second quarter of last year, and we're executing on our strategy to grow transaction margin dollars.\nWe're encouraged by the progress we're making against our longer term initiatives that will support improved transaction margin performance over time. Q2 marked the third quarter in a row that we've delivered meaningful expansion in our operating margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Ongoing discipline in managing our cost structure allowed us to more than offset transaction margin compression with operating expense leverage on a non-GAAP basis. Non-transaction related operating expenses declined 11%, with reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories, contributing significant leverage. Strong expense performance resulted in 20% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth in operating income that we've delivered in more than two years. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 228 basis points to 21.4%, which was slightly below the guidance we gave for the quarter.\nThis is principally attributable to our credit portfolio, where we earned less revenue than expected and increased loss provisions. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 24% to $1.16, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $14.4 billion. The net cash outflows for originations of loans held for sale reduced cash flows from operations by $1.2 billion in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of negative $350 million. Later this year, when the sale of the European BNPL back book closes, the proceeds will be recognized in cash flows from operations and offset this decline.\nWhile the timing of accounting treatment will affect the quarterly profile of our free cash flow, there is no change to our outlook for the year, and we continue to expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. We completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases for the full year. We now expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our buyback program. Our recently announced credit externalization will help optimize our balance sheet and improve our capital efficiency. Given our desire to return capital to shareholders, and the confidence we have in our business, we've taken a more aggressive approach to share repurchases. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has declined 6%. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023.\nAs Dan shared, based on our results through the first half of the year, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year for non-GAAP operating margin expansion and earnings per share in the aggregate. For the first and second quarters of 2023, we've delivered revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency-neutral basis. We expect revenue growth in the back half of the year to be in line with this performance, if not slightly ahead, given the momentum we're seeing in the business. In addition, we're on track to meet our expense guidance for the year, and are committed to delivering at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We also continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.95, representing 20% growth from 2022. We're reiterating our full-year guidance while absorbing incremental pressure from our credit portfolio.\nGiven strengthening business performance driven by checkout initiatives and our ongoing realization of productivity gains, for the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 8% on both a spot and currency neutral basis to approximately $7.4 billion at current spot rates. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.22-$1.24, representing growth of approximately 13.5% at the midpoint of the range. In summary, we're proud of our solid operating results this quarter. PayPal's unique competitive advantages, including our portfolio of differentiated assets, and our global scale and ubiquity, continue to drive us forward. We're committed to investing in our core strengths and building PayPal for the future, and we're guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers.\nOur revenue momentum and customer engagement trends position us well to achieve our growth objectives this year and beyond. Given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on managing the things we can control and allocating capital with discipline to ensure we optimize for long-term value creation and resiliency. Dan and I are happy to take your questions. Sarah, please go ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, then return to the queue. If you have a follow-up, we'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Chin Jin Huang of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (JP Morgan)\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nHey, thanks a lot. I want to ask a question on E Commerce health and Dan, I know you talked about it up front. We're just getting a lot of questions on the E Commerce industry in general. You mentioned inflation easing should help. I'm curious about other trends like shift from services to goods, like our economists are talking about, which I think would also be a tailwind for you versus a headwind previously. Is this something you're seeing or maybe is that changing how you're thinking about the second half versus a quarter ago? It seems like there's some room for upside in your outlook here given the exit growth rate and what you talked about for July. Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks. It's great to hear your voice, and thanks for the question. I think the story of the quarter is really sort of the shape of the results inside the quarter, then the strong exit as we went into July and seeing July results. You know, in our view right now, we are beginning to see an inflection point. We're seeing our results on a slightly different trajectory for sure. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're clearly seeing a lot of headwinds begin to shift towards tailwinds. E Commerce is definitely one of those. We see E Commerce growth accelerating. We think it is at least in the mid single digits right now. That's substantially above what we thought when we entered the year, where we thought it might be flat year over year.\nI would say got a slight bias that that will continue to accelerate. You've got a range out there from, you know, low of zero to high of 10%. We think it's probably right in the middle of that. We think it is being driven by a shift from travel and services into goods, into fashion, more coming into retail pieces of that. Clearly, as inflation cools, we would expect to see more discretionary spend rebound, and that will help drive E commerce. One of the headwinds we face was E commerce growth slowing. Now it's accelerating again, and that clearly will be meaningful for us. We're also seeing improvements, as Gab's mentioned, in Cross Border. That's beginning to accelerate again. That's obviously a very meaningful thing for us because, one, our value proposition is perfect for Cross Border.\nIt's consumers buying from merchants that they don't really know, but they trust PayPal to make sure that that payment will be protected for them. It's obviously extremely high-margin business for us, and that seems to be accelerating nicely right now. PPCP, which was, you know, a really important introduction for us for numerous reasons, could not have had a better reception in the market. We've got tremendous momentum there. Braintree continues to go from strength to strength, and we're seeing a lot of our value-added services now start to take hold. I can talk about some of that later in the call if somebody wants to ask about that. Obviously, branded checkout is accelerating. That 8%, you know, is the highest we've seen since the end of the pandemic, and we continue to expect to see that strengthen as we go through the year.\nAs many of our initiatives are really taking hold in the last quarter, we've got another 200 plus experiments that are going to happen in Q3. That's all adding to momentum, and I guess at the end of the day what that's adding up to when we look at our net promoter score, we're now at a seven-year high in that. There's clearly a lot of momentum in the business right now, and we just want to double down on that. We do obviously feel a lot better today than we did 90 days ago. I think that's just going to continue when you ask that same question a quarter from now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darren Peller with Wolf Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarren Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolf Research\n\nHey, thanks guys. You know, revenue growth was obviously sound, but we still saw transaction profit dollars a little less pronounced versus revenue. I think it actually may have decreased a bit year over year. You know, Gabrielle, I know you talked about some one-time growers and hedging differences, and I'm sure the mix between branded, unbranded continues to have an impact given the growth of Braintree. If you could just help us understand the moving parts in the quarter and the trends into the second half as far as gross profit or transaction profit growth goes, that'd be great.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYou bet. You bet, Darren. For the quarter, transaction margin dollars grew 1%, which is essentially in line with Q1. That said, when we look at the underlying performance of our business, we're very encouraged by the stronger results we're seeing. In my prepared remarks, I called out several items that created headwinds to growth in the quarter due to lapping. In addition, we actually had some benefits that we saw in the quarter as well from the release of reserves, from held for sale reclassification, as well as from lapping that large merchant exposure last year. When we adjust for all these items, both the benefits and the drags on a more normalized basis, we actually see transaction margin dollars in the quarter growing several points faster than the reported 1%. What we're really encouraged by is the strengthening profile of the business.\nWe're actually starting to see the benefits of our initiatives. As we get through some of the noise from lapping, we do expect to see improving transaction profit growth. When we think about the back half in Q3, we'll still see some pressure on transaction margin performance. In Q4, we expect to see an improvement. Over the longer term, our TM profile in the future will certainly be benefited by the acceleration in branded checkout, by E Commerce, acceleration by the improved cross border trends that Dan referred to, as well as from the value-added services that we're adding on the PSP side.\n\nDarren Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolf Research\n\nThat's really helpful. It sounds like some of these initiatives are third, fourth quarter events, but they could move the needle. Starting then.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nWe expect to exit the year in a much stronger position from a TM trajectory than where we are right now.\n\nDarren Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolf Research\n\nOkay, very good. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Fauscette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much. I wanted to follow up on Darren's question. I know that Unbranded seems to be a drag or dilutive to margins right now overall, which is a little bit surprising given just kind of how margin structure tends to be throughout the industry. I know you've talked a little bit in the past about adding incremental services to Unbranded that could improve that structural margin component in Unbranded. Can you talk a little bit about what that may look like, timing, and if any of those initiatives will play a role in improving the transaction margin that you're looking at for the latter part of this year? Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, I'll take a crack at that. James, thanks for the question. You know, our PSP business does continue to go from strength to strength. As we talked about, our overall TPV was nearly 30% in the quarter. That's despite, as Gabrielle mentioned, deprecating some of our older PSP flows. You know, things coming off of our PayPal Pro. We actually migrated about $5 billion of TPV from our legacy stacks onto PPCP in this past quarter. You know, it's a bit of a drag in the quarter, but we're going to be done with that by the end of the year. We continue to win marquee accounts in the business, whether that be Booking.com, Meta, or Allstate Insurance. You know, these are big accounts that we are winning, because winning PSP is a strategic imperative for us.\nIt allows us to have our latest checkout experiences with the largest, most important merchants in the world across PayPal, Venmo, and Buy Now Pay Later. We capture 100% of the data flows, which really is feeding our AI engines. It's fueling what will be our next generation checkout, and most importantly, it's fueling kind of our ability to have best-in-class auth rates in the industry and the lowest loss rates in the industry. In terms of the higher margin services that we're going to be putting out there, you know, we are seeing a lot of traction on that right now. For instance, we are moving into in-store. That's always been an area of opportunity for us. We are now fully implemented with 20 marquee merchants in over 1,000 in-store locations.\nOver 2,500 POS systems will continue to do quite well there and push significantly in that we're making good progress in selling things like payouts, risk as a service, disputes automation. We're seeing our largest customers begin to adopt that right now, whether it be SHEIN or Meta, or TikTok. Really, these are some of the bigger clients that we have adopting our value-added services. I'll just give you one example. We just started doing orchestration in six additional LATAM countries with much higher margins, and where we're doing that orchestration for our largest customers, we're seeing like 190 basis point auth rate improvement. You're seeing kind of this win-win as we're doing this, and then of course PPCP as it goes down market is a much higher margin product for us.\nYeah, I talked about all of the channel partners that have already implemented that or are in the middle of implementing, and we've got another 25 more partners by year end. In the US, another 15 EU partners by year end. We're seeing a tremendous amount of scaling on that. We've also enabled here in the US 1.2 million SMB merchants to basically do a one-click migration into PPCP. We've already done all the risk assessment for them. They're on the right platforms for us to be able to seamlessly transition them onto that platform. I think we're going to see a large amount of volume moving into PPCP. That's obviously higher margin. The high value-added services on Braintree will also help, and those will develop over time.\nClearly every quarter they will add, and the sum cumulative total will start to feel as we kind of exit the year, and certainly as we go into 2024 with that. I hope that helped James a little bit.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nNo, that's great, thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question this evening. In terms of operating margin performance, were there any factors besides credit that had a bigger impact than you expected in Q2? Separately, can you just talk about the overall health of the credit business? Give us more color on the steps you're taking to maybe manage it a little bit differently? It sounded like that was the plan.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nAbsolutely. For the quarter, we expanded our operating margin by about 228 basis points to 21.4%. This was a slight miss to our guidance of approximately 22%, and it was predominantly driven by increased pressure from PayPal Business Loans. There is no other item that really contributed to that miss. Overall, PayPal Business Loans was about a 90 basis point drag to transaction margin and to operating margin. This is approximately two times what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. It really was a real impact as it relates to our broader credit business. We are in a really good position. Like the rest of the industry, we are seeing some reversion back to pre-Covid levels of performance, but across our diversified portfolio of consumer and merchant credit, we are seeing relatively stable delinquency and charge-off trends.\nThe largest growth area for us continues to be our Buy Now Pay Later solutions, where our performance continues to be very strong. Of course, going forward, given our partnership with KKR, the majority of the originations are going to be funded off balance sheet for us, and we'll be able to support the sustained growth of that business. On the PayPal business loan side, this is really the part of our portfolio where we have seen deterioration. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net receivable. We've historically seen consistently strong performance in this book, and last year we widened the credit box, and the performance has not been within our expected risk appetite. We've taken steps to improve performance. We significantly tightened originations.\nToday the book is down about 30% in total receivables, and we expect this pressure to continue through the back half of the year, but then really to abate as we move into next year. That said, the overall strength of our business and the momentum we're seeing is allowing us to maintain our operating margin and EPS guidance for the year while we're absorbing this credit pressure.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks so much. Very helpful. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, guys. I wanted to come back to branded TPV growth. You had 6.5% in the month of June. You were over 8% in July. You're expecting further acceleration during the balance of the year. Can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of and the visibility on that ongoing improvement, like how much of it is better macro, how much is traction with PayPal's own branded checkout initiatives, and you know, which among those branded checkout initiatives is moving the needle most materially here in 2023. Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, I'll take a crack at that. Jason, thanks for the question. It's an important one. We are really pleased, obviously, to see branded checkout accelerate like it is, and we have good confidence that the initiatives that we're putting into place are going to continue to drive that growth. You know, as I think about what is driving that growth, it's hard to delineate exactly what is happening because of macro in terms of E commerce improving in general. As I mentioned to Chin Jin's first question around E commerce and what is due to our initiatives. We are clearly putting a lot of time, effort, and resource into improving the checkout experience. My hats off to that entire checkout team for all that they've done here.\nI say look, first of all, as E Commerce is growing, we're going to grow with it because we are clearly one of the market leaders, if not the market leader, in digital payments. Around that, we do have a scale advantage over anybody in terms of 30 million plus merchants that we have out there, 80% of the top 1,500 Internet retailers. We have a performance advantage in checkout. You know, we're up to 600 basis points better in auth rates than the industry average, and we have a trust advantage. You know, when small businesses put PayPal on their site, they see their online sales go up by almost 44%. Those are things that we are building upon. As we mentioned in our Investor Day on 8th June 2023, the amount of acceleration in the amount of innovation we're putting into the market has improved dramatically.\nWe did 100 A/B tests in the first quarter. We did 200 A/B tests, an incremental 200 in the second quarter. We're going to do another 200 coming here in the third quarter. In general, about 30% or so of those A/B tests that we run actually create positive benefit coming out of them. What that means is we're going to have like 150 or so improvements in checkout in our digital wallets running through our metrics as we go through. Some of those are one or two basis points difference. Some of those can increase TPA by 10 or 15 basis points. When you put all of those together, it's extraordinarily powerful. We are definitely seeing that in our results. We also are beginning to see a lot of our merchants move to our latest integrations.\nWe know that when we're native in app on the mobile that we hold or gain share. You know, we talked like a quarter or two ago about 33 of our top 100 merchants had our latest checkout integrations, and we had an aspiration to be at 50 by the end of the year. I'm pleased to report that now 43 of our top 100 merchants are on our latest checkout integration, so we're making really good progress around that. We're not, we're not above doing just like the basics. We are improving availability, latency is now improved by 45% year-over-year. Every couple of milliseconds increases conversion rates on that, and passwordless is really important for us.\nYou know, the rollout of passkeys, some other authentication methodologies that we're using now, except the EU, which has SCA, strong customer authentication, we're at about 70% of our checkouts that are passwordless. That's going to continue to go up as we push passkeys. We're now taking passkeys into the EU, which will be very beneficial because you can actually take out the friction of SCA in those conversions as well. We're going to push that really hard. You see all the other big initiatives that we're doing. The pre-introduction, you know, pre-approved amounts for BNPL. By the way, in the US, we've rolled that out to 60 million of our customers.\nWe are seeing a 25% to 30% increase in first time users of Buy Now Pay Later, and those are using it 5% to 10% more in terms of the overall TPV than those that did not have the pre-approved amounts. We are going to roll out another 50 million pre-approved into the EU at the beginning of this quarter. We are taking our rewards up, our rewards and cash back. We saw a 20% increase in the number of people using it from Q1 to Q2, and are now up over 10 million people using our rewards. When they use our rewards, their TPA goes up by 32%. These are some of the things that we are doing that are making a big difference.\nWe've got a lot of things planned for Q3, and we're beginning to see it in the results. We hope to be able to continue to point that out and continue to highlight what we hope to be increased growth in branded checkout.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for all the thoughts.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Thank you.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nStock Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nCan you provide an update on your cost takeout plan for 2023, the progress you've made, and do you have any preliminary thoughts quantifying how OpEx reductions will carry into 2024?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, thanks for that, David. I'll start and then probably Gab's will jump in on this. Look, we're going to continue to do surgical discipline in our cost structure. It was down 11% in Q2 for the full year. We still expect that to decline consistent with what we talked about by 10%. Therefore, when we think about our operating margin expansion coming up by at least 100 basis points and some of that incremental pressure that we're absorbing on the credit side that, as Gab's mentioned, will kind of move through our numbers by the end of the year. You're obviously seeing, you know, growing margin expansion driven by some of the top line enhancements we're doing, not just the cost discipline that we've demonstrated.\nI would just say that this is not just about efficiencies, but this is about doing things faster and accelerating the velocity of our innovation. You know, it's not about trade-offs, it's about lower cost, but higher performance. You're seeing that because I look at our NPS being at seven-year highs, look at the amount of innovation that we're now pumping through the system. Right now, we're getting more done more efficiently. There's no question that AI is going to impact every single company and every function, just as it will inside of PayPal. We've been experimenting with a couple hundred of our developers using tools from both Google, Microsoft, as well as Amazon, and we are seeing 20% to 40% increases in engineering productivity.\nJust imagine that in terms of how much more product we can get into the market and how efficiently we can do that. I think we've always known and anticipated that AI will drive productivity improvements, really, for the foreseeable future. I think the exciting, more unexpected result is that we think it's going to transform our value proposition as well. Things like enabling us to look into all of our transactions, look at early fraud metrics, be able to feed that back to customers with early fraud alerts that assure them that we are protecting them, enabling them to add more and more financial instruments to us as well that we can protect. This PayPal Assistant that's gonna, that's really an AI chatbot. We've been using it internally inside our consumer app. It's pretty amazing what it can do. Obviously, our advanced checkout, things like customized rewards.\nAI is gonna be a thing that not only drives productivity improvements for us, but really importantly, value proposition improvements for us. We're surgical in our cost thing. We've been very disciplined in it. We're quite pleased with it, and I think we'll see productivity improvements over the years to come.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you know, as Dan said, we're on track for a 10% decline in our other opex for the year. The first half is down kind of low double digits, call it 11.5%, 12% in the back half of the year. Of course, we begin to lap some of the cost savings that we began to take out last year, and so the decline in other OpEx declines a bit. We'll be in sort of the high single digits then, you know, building on what Dan said just around delivering better experiences to our customers, and the productivity gains. It's also coming from the platform migration and consolidation work that we're doing, and that too allows us to scale more efficiently over time.\nYou should expect to see us continue to look for ways to deliver better experiences to our customers and scale them efficiently on our platform.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nStock Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line. Sorry, we have time for one last question. It comes from the line of Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys, thanks for. How you doing? Dan, thanks for letting me ask a question here. Wanted to ask about the consumer value prop. A big piece of that is going to be the wallet and the enhancements of the wallet, including offers. Can you just talk about some of the initiatives you're doing there that's going to improve the digital wallet going forward?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously increasing the number of consumers who use our digital wallet is one of our most important initiatives because we feel it's going to drive both engagement, ARPU, monthly active users. The app user today, the typical app user, has a 35% greater ARPU, 60% greater TPV, and 25% less churn. The more we can put on that, the better. About 55% of our base today uses the app, just to give you an idea of that. The app, to your point, you know, is designed to enable the full shopping experience from discovery, which is like the deals and offers that you just mentioned, to flexible payments.\nYou know, the widest array of funding choices, things like Buy Now Pay Later, split tender that enables you to utilize two different funding sources to buy your purchase to post purchase, which includes, you know, package tracking, returns management, refunds directly into your PayPal wallet. I won't go in again to all the experimentation we're doing, but you can see kind of the tremendous amount of velocity there. The new features that are coming into the wallet include this early fraud alert. We've scaled that now to 10%. That's really designed to protect our customers. We can see fraudulent signals well before others. We can let a consumer know that their card has been compromised. We can simultaneously let the FI know so that that card can be reissued instantaneously. We're seeing early but really positive response to consumers from this.\nIt causes them to kind of these alerts that come. It causes them to open the app. The more they open the app, the more they do with us. I think I mentioned on the rewards cash back, that will be something that we'll be putting some resource into because we're seeing a tremendous interest in it. You know, these users are up 20% quarter-over-quarter. The TPA is gigantic improvement, as I mentioned, about a 32% improvement on that package tracking. We're now 100% ramped across iOS and Android. It scrapes basically your Gmail account to look for any of your e commerce orders. They don't even have to be through PayPal. We consolidate them all into one place, into our PayPal app. We're seeing a 20% app engagement uplift. For those who sign up for that, a 10% improvement in TPA.\nThings like savings, you know, that's now at a 4.3% interest rate. When somebody does that, their ARPU goes up $26, and their login to the app goes up 16 times. Those who don't have a savings account with us, I mentioned Buy Now Pay Later preapproval. That's, you know, 50 million more to come this quarter in the EU, and we'll start things like our advanced AI checkout with our first clients later this year, and our PayPal Assistant using AI technology as well. Those are just some of the things to come. There's a lot of innovation, and as I mentioned, my hat's off to the team because I think they're just doing a great job, hitting their schedule, doing constant experimentation, and really making our experiences much improved and moving towards best in class. Thanks, everyone, for your great questions. I really appreciate it.\nI want to thank everybody for your time, and we look forward to speaking to all of you later. Take care. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nSa.",

Please go ahead.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you. Sarah, good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our investor relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we'll refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties.\nThese statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2023, our planning assumptions for 2023, and our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rates, operating margin, and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our investor relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, 8 May 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Gabs, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a good start to the year with stronger than expected growth across our key financial metrics, and I'm particularly pleased to see the TPV from our branded checkout meaningfully accelerate to 6.5% growth FXN, up 200 basis points from Q4, while our unbranded TPV growth also accelerated from Q4 to post year-over-year growth of 30% FXN. Even with this strong start, there remain many challenging issues to navigate as we look forward. Both the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments are complex and difficult to predict. In these times, the strong message I'm giving the PayPal team is to focus on the things we can control. We know that job number one is to invest and innovate to improve our value proposition to our merchants and consumers.\nSince we honed our strategic priorities last year, we have consistently executed and delivered against our roadmap, and this work is beginning to reflect in our results. Of course, we still have room to improve in multiple areas, but we are making large strides in upgrading our merchant and consumer experiences, which are both significantly strengthened from a year ago. We are focused on executing in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. As you can tell from our non-transaction-related OPEX performance, we are more than delivering against our plan. As encouraging as these early results are, I would point out that we are just at the beginning, and as a multi-year efficiency journey. For several years, we've been at the forefront of advanced forms of machine learning and AI to combat fraud and to implement our sophisticated risk management programs.\nWith the new advances of generative AI, we will also be able to accelerate our productivity initiatives. We expect AI will enable us to meaningfully lower our costs for years to come. Furthermore, we believe that AI, combined with our unique scale and sets of data, will drive not only efficiencies, but will also drive a differentiated and unique set of value propositions for our merchants and consumers. Despite the fact that today's macro environment is difficult to forecast, we believe we are well positioned to deliver a strong year and enter next year poised to reap additional revenue streams from the investments we are making in our products, while continuing to drive efficiencies and reduce our overall cost structure. Let me now turn to our Q1 results. As I said, we were quite pleased with the quarter.\nOur revenues grew by 10.4% FXN to $7.04 billion in Q1, nearly 1.5 points better than our guidance. Consequently, we anticipate our full year revenues to be stronger than we expected, with the back half of the year being roughly similar in growth to the front half. We processed $355 billion of TPV, an acceleration of nearly 300 basis points sequentially from Q4 to 12% FXN, driven by 5.8 billion transactions in the quarter. With our branded checkout growing by 6.5%, we believe we improved our global share of checkout and gained share in unbranded processing. We saw our monthly active base slightly increase in line with our expectations, while TPA grew by 13% year-over-year. Importantly, our core PayPal consumer transactions per user improved throughout the quarter, and in March was 400 basis points higher than in March of last year.\nIn addition, we saw consistent improvement in the quality of new cohorts in Q1 versus last year. For instance, our March cohort of new accounts had 24% higher TPA and 40% higher ARPA than in March of last year. These results strongly reinforce our decision to focus our resources on engagement and driving high value accounts. Driven by continued discipline and execution, our non-GAAP EPS for Q1 grew by 33% to $1.17, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.07. As a result, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year to $4.95, up 20%. Our three strategic priorities remain consistent, improve our core checkout proposition, grow our unbranded processing, and drive adoption of our digital wallets. We are making good and steady progress on each of these interrelated goals.\nI'd like to highlight our unbranded suite of services, including Braintree and our newest platform for SMBs and channel partners, PayPal Complete Payments. Within the highly fragmented processing ecosystem, our PSP offering across unbranded and other merchant services is growing faster than the market, and we are taking share. We believe that in an apples-to-apples comparison, our volumes in these areas are now roughly equal to that of Adyen and Stripe. There are four points I want to make regarding our unbranded momentum. First, unbranded processing is a strategic imperative for us. Enabling our merchants with our unbranded service helps ensure that we have a deep relationship with our most important merchants. It enables us to bring our latest and most technologically sophisticated checkout integration across PayPal and Venmo, and our Buy Now Pay Later service to our merchant base.\nGoing forward, we will primarily focus on enabling unbranded processing and our latest branded checkout experiences through Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments. Based on our early observations, our share of branded checkout stabilizes or grows when our latest checkout integrations are in place. Second, we will continue to invest to help ensure our unbranded platforms are best in class, enabling our merchants to reduce fraud and increase their sales conversion rates. We will do this while providing a comprehensive orchestration layer that enables our merchants to have a single point of contact and integration in a multi PSP environment. Our platform reliability is now amongst the best in class, and our integrated servicing capabilities are increasingly differentiated. Third, we are focused on substantially improving the margin structure of our unbranded business.\nOur PayPal Complete Payments platform opens a new $750 billion TAM in the small and mid-sized business market with a significantly enhanced margin structure compared with our largest enterprise customers. Our Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments platforms are also expanding overseas, where we can drive higher margins, and we are adding value-added services to our platform like Risk-as-a-Service, full omnichannel capabilities, payouts, and FX-as-a-Service to both enhance functionality and add incremental margins. Finally, enabling merchants with our unbranded services will provide a constant stream of incremental data to feed our AI engines and fuel our next-generation checkout platform.\nWe believe no other company will be able to replicate the unique nature and scale of our data set, and in the future, our AI engines will use that data to drive differentiated capabilities to improve the entire checkout experience for our merchants. We anticipate that this combination of initiatives will enable our unbranded services to become a clear market leader, drive additional growth in our branded checkout, enable our next generation of checkout, and provide new sources of margin growth. I would add that we continue to win and expand services with new marquee customers like Live Nation, Booking.com, and Adobe. Our focused efforts in improving our brand at checkout are clearly making a difference in the market and in our results. Our product and engineering teams have driven substantial improvements in availability, latency, and passwordless login.\nWe also expect that our in-app native checkout solution via our APIs and SDKs, along with the deployment of our PayPal Complete Payments platform to our largest channel partners, should begin to bear significant fruit in bringing our legacy base to our latest integrations. Buy Now Pay Later continues to provide meaningful value to both our consumers and merchants. Over 32 million consumers have used our Buy Now Pay Later service since inception. At nearly 3 million merchants, we are now one of the most popular Buy Now Pay Later services in the world. With $6 billion of TPV in Q1 growing at 70% on a currency neutral basis, consumers spend 30% more on our branded checkout when using Buy Now Pay Later, and we believe we have amongst the highest authorization rates and lowest loss rates in the industry.\nVenmo continues to grow its revenues by double digits, and we were pleased to see its TPV accelerate 550 basis points from Q4 to $63 billion. We're continually working to improve the Venmo P2P experience. This quarter, we launched an easier, more intuitive way to split P2P payments across multiple people, and we also increased the add funds limit for Venmo to $10,000. We recently added the ability for Venmo customers to transfer crypto to other users and external wallets, bringing it on par with the experience on PayPal. Later this year, we will add the ability for a Venmo user to pay a PayPal user and vice versa, bringing more utility to both customer bases. We are currently piloting the upcoming launch of Venmo Teen Accounts, which have been requested by both parents and teens for some time.\nOur Amazon and Starbucks experiences continue to grow nicely, and we recently launched PayPal and Venmo with McDonald's, and just signed a deal with Microsoft to launch both Pay with Venmo and Buy Now Pay Later for Microsoft's Xbox Store. Finally, I'd like to briefly touch on the search for my successor. The board has formed a subcommittee, and we are working with a leading search firm. We have detailed sets of criteria and skill sets to assess both internal and external candidates. We still plan to announce my replacement before year end, and the process is well underway. One of the most important criteria influencing my decision to retire was that I felt that PayPal was on the right path to emerge from this economic climate in not only strong financial health, but also as a clear market leader in payments.\nOur results this quarter are another solid proof point that we are on that path. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and excellent execution. We still have a lot to accomplish and prove, but our customers are responding to our efforts, and that is and will always be our North Star. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gabs.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners, and global team for helping us to deliver a great quarter. Our results demonstrate the relevance, diversification, and strength of our payments platform. We are reporting healthy volume and revenue growth. This solid top line performance, in conjunction with strong expense management and efficiency gains, resulted in outstanding earnings growth. Notably, we accelerated our revenue and earnings growth on both a year-over-year and sequential basis relative to the first quarter targets we shared with you in February. Both our revenue and EPS outperformed. The foundation we established last year for cost discipline and to realize productivity gains allowed us to expand operating margin and deliver profitable growth. Before discussing our outlook for the second quarter, I'd like to review our first quarter results.\nAs Dan mentioned, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis and 9% at spot to $7.04 billion. This represents a three-year revenue CAGR of 15%, and 20% excluding eBay. Transaction revenue grew 6% to $6.4 billion, driven primarily by our unbranded processing volume. Other value-added services revenue grew 39% to $676 million, predominantly due to higher interest income on customer stored balances, and to a lesser extent, solid performance from consumer and merchant Credit. In the first quarter, US revenue grew 13%. International revenue grew 3% at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis, accelerating both year-over-year and sequentially. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 93 basis points, 5 basis points higher than Q1 last year. This increase was primarily driven by 30% growth in our unbranded processing volume.\nThese volumes grew approximately three times faster than our overall TPV growth. As a result, transaction expense dollars grew 17%. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, a 2 basis point improvement versus last year. Transaction loss dollars declined 7%. Our ongoing risk mitigation activities and our mix of volumes drove this improved performance. Credit losses were $142 million or 4 basis points as a rate of TPV. We ended Q1 with $7.5 billion in net receivables, flat sequentially. Originations were primarily driven by the strength of our Buy Now Pay Later franchise. As we have discussed, later this year we plan to externalize a significant portion of this portfolio, reducing our balance sheet exposure, and securing a long-term partner to support sustainable and healthy growth.\nOur reserve coverage ratio increased sequentially to 7.8% in Q1 from 7.4%, reflecting growth in the consumer receivables portfolio and some deterioration in our PayPal business loans portfolio relative to Q1 2022. Our reserve coverage ratio improved 50 basis points. Similar to the broader industry overall, we're seeing a normalization of our credit portfolio to pre-Covid delinquency levels. We continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our credit portfolio, and are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment while making appropriate adjustments to ensure we continue to perform within our internal risk appetite. Continuing the trend from 2022, growth of unbranded processing volumes outpaced growth in branded volume, resulting in slower transaction margin dollar growth. Volume-based expenses in the aggregate increased 17%, and transaction margin dollars grew 1% to $3.3 billion. Transaction margin declined to 47.1% from 50.9% in Q1 last year.\nWhile we do anticipate ongoing mix shift, we believe that this performance will improve as we execute against the strategies that Dan outlined to drive increased profitability across our unbranded processing volumes and accelerate growth of our branded franchise. Strong discipline across non-transaction related operating expenses more than offset the contraction in transaction margin. On a non-GAAP basis, non-transaction related operating expenses declined more than 12%, with reductions in sales and marketing, technology and development, and customer support and operations expenses contributing significant leverage. This expense performance resulted in 19% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth in operating income that we have experienced in eight quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin reached 22.7%, expanding 201 basis points from the first quarter of 2022.\nIn addition, we're pleased to be reporting $1.17 in non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1, representing 33% growth year-over-year. We continue to be in a very strong position from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, ending the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $15.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow. Cash taxes related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property reduced operating cash flow by approximately $430 million, and in Q1, we allocated $1.4 billion to share repurchases for the full year. We continue to expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow and to repurchase roughly $4 billion of our shares. I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the second quarter and update our outlook for the full year.\nFor the second quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 7.5%–8% on a currency-neutral basis and 6.5%–7% at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15–$1.17, representing growth of approximately 25% at the midpoint of the range for the full year. Given our earnings outperformance in the first quarter, we are raising our outlook. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 20% to approximately $4.95, an increase of 2 points of growth from the guidance we shared in February. At the start of the year, we indicated that our framework for 18% non-GAAP EPS growth in 2023 contemplated revenue growth coming in as low as mid-single digits. We also shared that our objective was to deliver revenue performance that exceeded this baseline.\nOur first quarter performance and the guidance for the second quarter are meaningful steps towards achieving this objective. As Dan indicated, assuming that current macro conditions continue, we now expect our back half revenue growth to be roughly in line with our performance in the first half of the year. Additionally, based on the expected contribution of unbranded processing volumes to our growth, we now expect at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2023. We are encouraged by our start to the year, and at the same time mindful that the environment remains dynamic. We're focused on execution and will be agile and responsive to how the macroeconomic environment is playing out, and we plan to continue to guide revenue one quarter at a time. To wrap up, we entered the year as a more focused business with strong fundamentals.\nWe're off to a great start in 2023 and believe we're well positioned to deliver revenue and earnings growth, expand margins, and generate strong free cash flow. We're continuing to invest to accelerate our growth and capture the meaningful opportunity ahead of us. In addition, our expansive scale enables us to realize additional efficiencies and productivity gains. We believe our digital payments platform is unrivaled in breadth and depth, which creates a powerful competitive advantage for us. We have conviction that our strategies to accelerate our branded checkout franchise, improve the margin profile of our unbranded processing platform, and strengthen our digital wallet will result in significant and enduring value creation for our shareholders. We look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Sarah, please go ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We request that you limit yourself to one question, please, and if needed, return to the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Nice performance here on revenue. I'll ask my one question there. Looks like Q1 clearly ahead. Like you talked about, the second quarter revenue growth is in line with what we have in the model. It's 3 points lower, 3.3, than what was just reported here. You're calling for second half to be in line with the first half, which is better than what we modeled and better than what you guys talked about before. My question is how much of this change is macro related versus maybe some momentum with some of the new products and integrations that Dan, you were talking about, as well as curious on share gains if your thinking is different there.\nWe've been curious if you've seen any sort of benefit from flight to quality with all the stresses in the banking system. Some of our survey work suggests that. Love to hear your thoughts on all that, if you don't mind. Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nSure. That was one question.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, no, it's worth it. Sorry.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, let me start with that and then Gabs can come in. First of all, obviously we had a real strong start to the year. We're stronger than our expectations, but we just missed around 11% FXN revenue growth. You know, at 10.4%, it's still 150 basis points better than our expectations on that. I think what really pleased us on that is all parts of the business accelerated. You know, you had TPV going up 300 basis points sequentially from Q4 to 12%. You know, branded grew by 200 basis points to 6.5% growth. Unbranded, you know, just continues to fire on all cylinders at 30%. Even Venmo was up almost 600 basis points. You know, it's a good, strong start.\nThe other thing that we didn't mention is our net promoter score, which is kind of, you know, how do our customers feel about us, is at a five-year high this quarter. Obviously, a lot of things are, you know, going the way that we hoped they would be. I think, you know, if you look at second quarter coming down, third quarter, and then fourth quarter, we're lapping some one-time events in Q2 and Q3 that put pressure of about a point to a point and a half on our growth. Normalized, you'd have, you know, Q2 off of those one-time things growing, you know, 8.5%, 9% or so. That's kind of the normalized growth in the quarter.\nAs we look out to the rest of the year in the back half, you know, what's changed in our outlook? First of all, we're 1/3 of the way through the year as opposed to just coming into the year. You know, there are two things that we think are happening right now. First of all, our initiatives are taking hold in the market. You know, there's no silver bullet on any one thing that comes in. These are a number of small things, whether it be improving latency, you know, 40% in the last year. You know, our goal is to improve it like 50% by the end of this year. Our availability being at an all-time high, you know, we are pretty much at five nines almost all the time.\nYou know, we're fixing bugs all over, we're reducing friction. There are less calls coming into service unbranded. We put a lot of investment in that, and it is taking off. We have very high expectations for what PPCP can do in the small and mid-sized market, and with our channel partners as well. We're seeing things like new cohort strength, as I mentioned in my remark, that are significantly higher than cohorts we've seen in quite some time. We know we still have a lot to go do there. When you have scale like ours and you start making small incremental improvements, it adds a flywheel effect. We're pretty pleased with what we're seeing there. The other thing is, look, we came into the year with really muted expectations around E-commerce, global E-commerce growth.\nWe thought it could be anywhere from -2% to maybe +2%, call it flat. In general, we saw that pick up in the first quarter. We think it could be low single digits, maybe as high as mid single digits. Clearly, consumers are turning more of their spend to E commerce than I think many of us expected. As long as we continue to see those trends, you know, we think now, which is very different than what we thought coming in, that the back half growth is going to be equal to our front half growth. It's a much improved outlook than we had before. Jackson.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks so much.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep, you betcha.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nTerrific. Thanks for taking my question, and thanks for all the detail on the unbranded strategy. Just a couple of follow up questions there, Dan, for you. One, can you elaborate a little bit on what's driving the 30% growth in unbranded TPV and how sustainable that is? Meaning, like, is it a couple of large clients that will eventually lap, or is this, you know, more broad-based growth? Second, can you just talk a little bit more about PayPal Complete Payments, competitive positioning down market, and, you know, where exactly you think that's going to win, and, you know, how quickly that will ramp. Thank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, Braintree continues to do extraordinarily well, and it's not just winning incremental clients, but we are growing our share of the overall PSP volume in our largest clients as well. Look, you know, we did expect Braintree and we do expect Braintree to moderate its growth, lapping some big deals last year. Honestly, we're working on some big deals this year too. We got a lot of momentum in Braintree, and I think its success, it's differentiated, it's driven by an open architecture where we are perfectly willing to orchestrate transactions to third party services and other PSPs. Now we've got integrated servicing, we've got our availability, I think now is amongst best in class. I think we've got the lowest loss rates, fraud in the industry, some of the highest auth rates, maybe up to 390 basis points better than others.\nWe've got a number of great value-added services, you know, that others have. We're expanding too, whether they be APMs, vaulting, real-time card updaters, or payouts. We're adding more and more that are really valuable to clients and also are very high margin, like FX-as-a-Service. If you look at, you know, Adyen's results and you see how much of their profits come from FX-as-a-Service, you can see why we're eager to add that. On the PPCP side of it, there are obviously some benefits as you move into the small and mid-sized market. First of all, you obviously have a higher margin structure than you do with your large enterprises. We clearly see that even in the PayPal button dynamics that we have. It's a really flexible, simple integration. It's fully featured as well.\nIt's got all the APMs, including Apple Pay. It's got vaulting, IC, real real-time account updater, and it's got all of our latest integrations in it. It's integrated with Zettle for omnichannel capabilities, and it also is targeted at channel partners, and that's a really important thing. We're making some really good progress in our initial conversations with a lot of our major channel partners. If those channel partners are hosted, they run their services as a hosted service. Once we upgrade them to PPCP, our latest checkout integrations very quickly move into that merchant base that's part of those channel partners, and it's a way of moving our long tail of merchants onto our latest checkout integrations. We're now fully live with PPCP here in the US. We'll expand to the EU and Australia next quarter.\nThe other really important thing about our unbranded services, besides the fact that we've got a deep relationship with our most important clients, is they drive a ton of data into our machine learning and AI engines. It's why we have amongst the lowest loss rates in the industry, the lowest instances of fraud, and the highest conversion rates. When I look at all that together, it's why I really spent time calling out, you know, why unbranded is a strategic imperative for us. You know, people have asked us about our transaction margin, what's happening with that? Looking at our growth of unbranded, to me that is a high class problem for us to have. We are winning in that market faster than we anticipated. We have a very well thought through strategy and set of actions to drive margin in that business.\nWe're very focused on making that happen. We're seeing the beginnings of that already happening. I appreciate the question, Lisa. I think it's a really important one.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys. Thanks. Braintree growth and mix obviously were a factor on the pay grade and margins, but if you could just help us understand the dynamics of margins in the second half. I know you're lowering your lower margin guidance by 25 basis points to 100 basis points despite, with obviously very strong expense management results. Maybe you could just help us understand how much of that is related to either the Braintree mix versus any other variables in the second half we have to keep in mind. Just as a quick add on to that, you know, when would we expect the strength of the Braintree volume we're seeing to actually translate to some higher margin offerings at a faster pace? Thanks again, guys.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet. I'll start. You're right. We have some margin dynamics that are worth calling out as it relates to first half versus second half performance, specifically as it relates to operating margin. Our Q1 operating margin performance is very, very strong with about 200 basis points operating margin expansion. In Q2, our expectation is actually that it would be ahead of that from an expansion standpoint. We're really delivering the vast majority of the margin expansion on the year from an operating margin standpoint in the first half of the year. The back half, we actually have some lapping dynamics and some nuances that will result in much more modest operating margin expansion for H2 overall. Within that, I would say it's worth highlighting that Q3, I'd expect to see some pressure on operating margin, maybe some slight pressure.\nIn Q4 we'll see expansion again, but more modest expansion than you're seeing in the first half of the year, and really sort of what the drivers of that are. Dan highlighted a few of them. We do have some lapping dynamics in the back half of the year. In Q3 specifically, there were some benefits on the TE side. We're also beginning to really lap the benefits from increased interest rates and the increased revenue that we earn on customer store balances that really starts in Q3 and continues in Q4. As we lap that, we don't expect to see as much operating margin expansion in the back half. In addition, we begin to really lap a lot of the cost savings work that started in the back half of last year.\nWhile we do expect to see meaningful declines in non-transaction related operating expenses in both Q3 and Q4 from a percentage decline standpoint, it will not be as great as what we're seeing in Q1 and Q2. All that taken together will result in that differential between the first half and the back half OP margin expansion for the full year. Again, we do expect to see at least 100 basis points of OP margin expansion. That change that you called out between the 125 and at least 100 is predominantly driven by the fact that when we're talking about our revenue being slightly ahead, a lot of the benefit that we're seeing is coming from the Braintree business and having a lot more visibility in that pipeline and that contributing to our top line, but also having some margin impact.\nDan, do you want to talk a little bit about the strategies in unbranded?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, I think maybe I'll just take a step back for a second. I mean, I think look, our strategy on average and over time is to deliver double digit EPS growth year after year after year. We've had a good track record in general of doing that. We've got a well thought through strategy and a set of actions that's going to deliver increased transaction margin dollars along with OPEX reductions to make sure that we do that. You know, we've talked a lot about the initiatives that we're focused on and we've been focused on the same thing for over a year now. It's drive branded checkout. That's our number one priority. All of our initiatives are linked to that. It's our highest margin service, it's our bread and butter, and we're absolutely determined to have that be best in class.\nYou know, we want to drive unbranded because of all the things I talked about in my remarks. It helps us unbranded share of checkout, it helps us in our data collection, and all of the things we can do with those unique sets of data. Unbranded will be a new source of margin generation for us. Without question, we are beginning to put those services already into place. Many of them will go into place by the fourth quarter, and I expect to see the majority of those things start to take effect in 2024. Clearly, we're managing our OPEX extremely well. I mean, I can talk in more detail on that if anyone has a question on it, but we said we thought it would be negative high single digits this year. It's likely to be -10%, 10%+.\nYou know, if anybody thought costs were going to be going up, they'll go down again next year as well. I can talk more about that. We've got a real set of initiatives and strategies focused on this. We're executing against it, and I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver on what we set out to do.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful, guys. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, guys. Good to see the improved revenue outlook here. I actually wanted to switch over to the branded side of TPV growth. As you mentioned, you had a couple of points of acceleration there. Wanted to understand which countries, or verticals, or other drivers, you know, what was behind that. Would you attribute any material amount of the improvement through the rollout of advanced checkout, and then just any directional comments on how branded checkout TPV growth may trend during the balance of the year in support of the revenue outlook you talked about. Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks for that, Jason. I think maybe I'll grab that one. If I just take a step back for a second, we are the market leader in online checkout, right? We've got 35 million merchants who accept us. 80% of the top 1,500 online retailers in the US accept us. There's no other digital wallet that comes close to that acceptance. In general, our auth rates are about 600 basis points better than the industry average. That means every time 100 things that a consumer does to buy from a merchant, we approve six more of them. You know, we've got consumer trust and brand trust in that when a small or mid-sized merchant puts PayPal on their website, they see a 44% conversion lift by doing that. These are really strong advantages that we're going to leverage going forward.\nObviously there's a ton of stuff we can still do. We're optimizing presentment, we're making sure that our best-in-class integrations are out there, whether that come through our branded checkout, whether that come through the new SDKs and APIs that we have, or whether that come through PPCP going into channel partners. We know when we have our best-in-class integrations, we either have stable share or growing share of checkout. Our availability, as I mentioned, is closing in on Five Nines. Our latency improved by 40%. We'll improve it up to 50% better. Makes a giant difference in conversion rates. Our passwordless login improved by 10 full points last year. We intend to grow that again this year, whether that be through passkeys, tethered ID, or forms of biometrics.\nBuy Now Pay Later, we're taking share there, and we are intending to continue to take share there. Our auth rates are higher, we think, than anyone else's because we know the customers coming in. Over 90% of the customers coming in to Buy Now Pay Later are already PayPal customers. That's why we think we also have the lowest loss rates. We know somebody mentioned flight to quality, that people are coming to PayPal and our Buy Now Pay Later services. We are targeting all of the largest merchants. We know when our competitors' contracts are up, and we are going after that business because we see a clear shift in market share as well as spend when we have Buy Now Pay Later in our checkout flows. Obviously, we're now full GA on our mobile checkout with our SDKs and APIs.\nWe are now beginning to experiment with the first generation of what we call AI powered checkout, which looks at the full checkout experience, not just the PayPal checkout experience, but the full checkout experience for our merchants. We have a lot of things underway in our branded checkout. I will just say this, the team is executing extremely well here. When they say they're going to get something done, they do. They have a roadmap that they are consistently executing. What they think will happen is happening in the market. I've got a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see branded share checkout be strong. We saw, by the way, in U.S., UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, most of the EU markets, and Australia, an improvement in our share position. Of course, there's not one uniform measure of market share.\nAny way you look at it, when your branded share or your growth goes up sequentially by 200 basis points, that's a lot of momentum.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Tognetti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Tognetti\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. How are you thinking about the opportunity for cost savings and OPEX reduction beyond 2023, and in particular, if you could, you know, maybe weigh that against potential, you know, transaction margin dynamics as well, to the extent those will continue next year based on the trend we saw in Q1.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, I'll start off and then Gabs can attack the last part of your question. First of all, obviously we had good, solid progress against what we said we were going to do. You know, -12% in Q1. I think our OPEX for the full year could decline as much as -10%, which is a bit higher than we expected. As I said in my remarks, we're just beginning on this efficiency journey. I think you're going to see our costs continue to come down year-over-year.\nThis is not just about efficiencies, by the way. It's not about cost reduction, it's about doing things better. I think, you know, there's no question that AI is going to impact almost every function inside of PayPal, whether it be our front office, back office, marketing, legal, engineering, you name it. AI will have an impact and allow us to not just lower cost, but have higher performance and do things better. This is not about trade offs, it's about doing both in there. The other thing that the teams are doing and doing extremely well is they're improving processes right now. They're removing friction. We've got a much simpler onboarding process. First, transaction resolution. We're seeing better engagement as a result. Fewer calls, as I mentioned, higher NPS. You're seeing that in our newest cohorts coming in with significantly higher TPA and ARPA.\nI think this is going to be a cost journey that we will be on for a long time to come. I think at the same time we will just be doing things better than we have ever been doing them before as well.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah.\n\nDavid Tognetti\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. Yeah.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nOh, please go ahead, David.\n\nDavid Tognetti\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, no, just the second piece of that as well, Dan, which is, is there an inflection point you see coming in terms of transaction margin dollar growth accelerating at some point later this year or in early 2024.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah. I really think about it as a multi-year journey that we're on to continue to transition the business and really drive more profitable volumes through the unbranded processing sector, while at the same time accelerating the growth in branded. We're off to a really good start. Q1, we saw acceleration in the branded business. It was very broad-based in terms of what we were seeing. We continue to see very strong growth on the unbranded side of the platform. Sequential acceleration in unbranded, given its size and scale, is very impressive given the base of business that we run. It will take some time to see what I would deem an inflection point in the overall sort of TM dynamics. I would say Q1 did have some nuances to it, which included about 130 basis points of impact just from normalizing our credit provisions.\nThat's not specifically related to unbranded branded mix. It really was sort of credit loss provisioning that impacted the TM rate as well. To your point, as we move through the year, we do continue to expect to see a continuation of the TM dynamic that played out in Q1. There are some exciting trends that we're seeing in the business, however. I'd say what we saw in cross border in Q1 and the growth in that business is quite encouraging. It was the strongest quarter we had for cross border really since Q4 2021. That, of course, has a higher yield to it overall. As we start to see some of those pieces of the business pick up, that will also help.\nFrom a TM standpoint, we did see some pressure as well in Q1, specifically on the unbranded side for PayPal. This is not Braintree business. The transitioning of our unbranded processing on the PayPal side to PPCP has created some pressure in the quarter, which we do not expect to be ongoing as we think about how we exit the year, given what our expectations are for PPCP. We are continuing to be disciplined about the growth of the business. We do expect all these strategies to start to play out and start to help turn the overall TM profile. I would expect it is going to take a number of quarters before we see what we would call an inflection point.\n\nDavid Tognetti\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nSure. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good afternoon, Dan, Gabrielle, thanks a lot for time this afternoon. I wanted to follow up on one of the comments or topics you've mentioned quite a bit in this call, Dan, and that's around engagement. I wonder if you can give some update. You mentioned that there's been some improvement in engagement, but wonder if you can give some update on those initiatives more specifically, you know, how that's helping engagement and conversion, especially things like advanced checkout, et cetera, and what kind of lifts you're getting from that, and maybe give a little more detail of how we should think about the tie into some of the unbranded initiatives, and if we think there can be further, at least improvement in those engagement levels or uptake by merchants, etc. Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nSure. First of all, as I mentioned, we've got these three initiatives. They all tie together, and they all lead to driving more share and volume of branded checkout. As we do more and more on our unbranded, we put out our latest integrations into the market. When we put out our latest integrations in the market, we take away friction, we take away latency, and we see more engagement and a lot more checkout go through our latest integrations. One of the initiatives that we haven't really spent time talking about is what we're doing on our digital wallets. Those are the three, right? Drive engagement and monthly active users and ARPA through our digital wallets, drive our checkout, drive our unbranded, and they're all linked together, and then keep a tight envelope on our cost structure.\nThose are the four things that we're focused on in the wallet. You know, we're making good, solid progress, whether that be on our Venmo wallet or on the PayPal side of it. Look, the PayPal app is already one of the largest commerce and payments apps in the world. It's used by about 55% of our base right now, up about 600 basis points year-over-year. Our app users are predominantly our monthly active users, and they're our power users. They've got 35% more ARPU, they've got 58% greater transactions per active on it, and their churn is at least 25% less than the rest of the base.\nYou know, the thing that I'm really pleased to see what John Kim and his team are doing is that the velocity of experimentation in our wallets now is like nothing that we've seen in quite some time. We have constant champion challenger hypotheses going out, replacing challengers that have been overcome by the champion, and that just starts to lead to more and more engagement going through. As I mentioned, on the consumer side, we saw a consumer transactions per user increase every single month in the quarter in March. They're 400 basis points better than March a year ago. The whole idea of the apps right now are three specific areas. One, upfront pre purchase, call that shopping, where it's really about discovery, saving, and rewards. We introduce rewards recently. We have over 6 million monthly active users in our rewards right now.\nThose that are using it have an increase in those 6 million of 45% in their transactions per active. I mean, these are huge numbers. They obviously need to go from 6 million to 10 billion to 25 million. That will happen over time. We have purchase, which is all about being the most flexible, easy way to purchase. Buy now, paid later really plays into that. There we're clearly taking share, we clearly intend to drive that. We have post purchase, which is like things like how do I track my packages, how do I get refunds easily, how do I put that right into my wallet? I talked about this last earnings call on package tracking. We're now 100% ramped in iOS. We do all the package scraping now off of Gmail.\nIn one place you can see all of your PayPal purchases and non-PayPal purchases. You can track all that in one place. For those users that have started to do that, their app engagement is up 32%, and their transactions are up 20%. All of these things, James, when you think about what we're doing on just being better in checkout, driving unbranded so that we can drive better integrations going forward, and what we're doing in the wallet, they all link together to really drive our MAUs, which are our most valuable customers by far and away. They went up slightly in Q1. You know, they're like 20x–30x more valuable than just an active user out there, and to drive, you know, transactions and ARPA. This is a flywheel. As Gab said, it takes time to drive it.\nA lot of the things we're seeing right now, the reason, you know, we are taking up our expectations for what we think our revenue growth will be, taking up kind of our, our, our EPS as well, is because we're seeing distinct improvements take place in the market.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's awesome. Thanks for that, Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet. My pleasure.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one last question from the lineup. Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank",
    "content2": "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about credit. Are you managing the book any different on credit, given the macro and exposure to BNPL and merchants? Just thinking about maybe the impact of provisions for credit losses for the rest of fiscal year 2023, maybe as a result of managing the book any different.\nThanks.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet. Thanks, Bryan. You'll see in the queue, which will be filed tomorrow, we did increase the provisions on the PPBL portfolio, which is a PayPal business loans portfolio. Overall, that portfolio is about 17% of our overall receivables, so sort of a sliver of our overall book. We did widen our credit box in the middle of last year. We have seen some performance that was less strong than we would have liked that is working its way through our system. We increased the provisions. We've already started to see an improvement overall. We tighten the box, and that's something that will just work its way through our systems. We'd expect delinquencies to worsen through Q2, peak in this quarter, and then improve throughout the remainder of the year based upon the origination strategy.\nThat piece of the book is a very small component of the overall portfolio. I'd say more importantly, the area that we're really growing, where the originations are quite strong, continues to be the buy now, pay later portfolio. There we've seen very broad-based strength, and that's a really important part of our strategy. It supports the improved checkout performance in our business on the branded side, and we're excited about the continued growth of that business overall. We did mention in the prepared remarks that our expectation is to externalize part of that portfolio during this year and work with a partner to really provide sort of longer-term, sustained support for growth in that portfolio. I think overall we continue to be very pleased with our credit portfolio. We've seen very good performance across the book.\nWe are seeing some normalization, which we expected to see as it relates to just sort of post normalization, post Covid, and really getting back to what we historically seen in terms of performance. In terms of reserve coverage, when we take a look at reserve coverage today versus when CECL started, which was the first quarter of 2020, we're actually a few hundred basis points better overall. The book itself continues to be quite healthy.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it, thanks so much.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYou bet.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nAll right, well, I think we're at the top of the hour, so I just want to thank everybody for your great questions. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thanks everybody. Take care. Bye bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."

Please go ahead.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, Briana. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties.\nThese statements include our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our preliminary framework for 2023, and our comments related to anticipated cost savings, operating margin, and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, 3 November 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligations to update this information.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased to share that our results in the third quarter exceeded the guidance that we announced in August, marking the third consecutive quarter of delivering on our non-GAAP guidance. Before reviewing our results and operational progress, I want to share two exciting developments that we believe will enhance our long-term strategic position. First, I am very pleased to announce that we are working with Apple to enhance our offerings for PayPal and Venmo merchants and consumers, leveraging Apple's Tap to Pay on iPhone functionality. Merchant customers in the US will soon be able to accept contactless debit or credit cards and mobile wallets, including Apple Pay, using an iPhone and the PayPal or Venmo iOS app. This will allow PayPal's merchant base to easily use their iPhone as a mobile point of sale without the need for a dongle or other payment terminals.\nWe believe that this, along with our other in-store initiatives, will continue to accelerate our opportunity to seamlessly process payments in the physical world for our merchants. We are also adding Apple Pay as a payment option in our unbranded checkout flows on our merchant platforms, including our PayPal Commerce Platform. We are already in beta with several e-commerce platforms and merchants, and anticipate a broader rollout in the coming months. Next year, US customers will be able to add their PayPal and Venmo network-branded credit and debit cards to their Apple Wallet and use them online and in-store wherever Apple Pay is accepted. We anticipate this to be available in the first half of 2023, expanding the opportunity for our consumers to transact in-store.\nThis is a significant step forward in our relationship with Apple, and we are excited to work closely with them to bring these new capabilities to our mutual customers. Second, I'm excited to share that we continue to ramp Pay with Venmo on Amazon, and we plan to be fully ramped in time for peak holiday shopping. This partnership is a reflection of Venmo's scale and ubiquity, particularly in younger demographics. We look forward to working closely with Amazon on this new offering to drive results. These relationships are aligned with our practice of working collaboratively with the major players across technology and financial services to provide more choice, and superior experiences, to our mutual customers. We are regarded by many as a partner of choice due to our scale and ubiquity, enabling us to create unique value for our customers.\nWhile we continue to enhance our strategic position, we remain focused on the operational initiatives that we shared last quarter. Our efforts to reduce our cost structure and drive productivity gains are yielding strong results. We remain on track to drive over $900 million in cost savings across our operating and transaction expenses this year and at least $1.3 billion in cost savings next year. This focus on efficiency, while continuing to invest in key growth areas, is a high priority for us. We now expect to grow our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 to approximately 22.5%. We further anticipate that in 2023, we will deliver at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion.\nLet me now turn to our results. Our revenues in the third quarter were $6.85 billion, up 12%, FXN and 11% spot, exceeding our guidance. I'm pleased to say that eBay's migration to managed payments is behind us and will be inconsequential to our results in the fourth quarter. Normalizing for eBay's migration to managed payments, our Q3 revenues grew approximately 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.08, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. The cost containment actions we discussed on last quarter's call have slowed the growth of our year-over-year non-transaction-related expenses to 4%. We now expect that non-transaction-related operating expenses for Q4 will be flat to slightly negative year-over-year, and we are planning similar levels in 2023. We are pleased with this execution, particularly as we are driving reinvestment in key growth areas, and continue to enhance our strategic position. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and an all-time record for us on an organic basis.\nWe added 2.9 million NNAs in Q3, and we expect to add another 3 to 4 million NNAs in Q4. I'm also very pleased to report that our transactions per active account in the quarter grew by a record 13% to 50.1x per year. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing our progress on checkout. With 35 million active merchant accounts and nearly 400 million active consumer accounts, our scale is like few others in the world, and represents a substantial competitive advantage in a business that is driven by network effects. In addition, we have built a high level of trust with our customers that drives significant preference to use our branded marks for online transactions. We have continued to grow faster than overall e-commerce in Q3, with our total TPV up 14% FXN, demonstrating the competitive differentiation and diversification of our global platform.\nWithin our PayPal-branded checkout business, we believe we held or gained share in the United States, with PayPal-branded checkout volumes up 4% year-over-year. While there is not a standard proxy for e-commerce growth, I would point to Bank of America's credit and debit card volume data, which highlights 2% US e-commerce growth in Q3, a full 200 basis points below our 4% branded checkout growth rate. We do expect we will continue to grow at or above the rate of e-commerce growth. However, we know there are still substantial opportunities for us to pursue. We have three major areas of focus for checkout: first, elevating and optimizing the consumer experience; second, providing merchants with a seamless integration experience and a one-stop shop for payments; and third, innovating new checkout solutions. As consumers move towards mobile shopping, we are focused on creating the simplest mobile checkout experience possible.\nThese enhancements include allowing customers to check out without leaving the original merchant point of interaction. For example, our recently updated mobile SDK allows merchants to provide a seamless in-app checkout experience. We are also deploying the latest secure user authentication standard for our consumers, enabling Passkeys on all iOS devices to drive speed, simplicity, and conversion. Our latest innovation is Accelerated Checkout, which will provide merchants with a robust solution and enables one-click checkout. This simplified consumer experience is achieved by leveraging vaulted credentials within our network to authenticate and approve customer purchases without the need for a password. This enables seamless guest or account checkout experiences by removing obstacles, which currently cause abandoned sessions. We are currently piloting this with several key partner platforms, and we look forward to expanding this initiative as we move through 2023 and beyond.\nFor each segment of our merchant base, we are implementing detailed processes, go-to-market plans, and KPIs to measure our migration from legacy integrations. Moving more of our merchant base to our latest and most advanced integrations will take time. This will clearly be a multi-year initiative, but it represents a significant opportunity for us, and we are putting resources, process, and discipline in place to assure our execution. We continue to see good momentum with our unbranded payment platforms. We believe we are well-positioned to help merchants orchestrate payments, leveraging our insights and machine learning to route traffic between multiple PSPs, resulting in increased approval and retention rates. Braintree is a key growth area for us, and we will continue to invest to further enhance the platform. Braintree TPV grew 38% in the quarter.\nOur Braintree momentum is driven largely by recent merchant wins and share of wallet expansions. We recently signed an expanded agreement with Live Nation, which establishes Braintree as their primary card processor across the globe and includes an extended marketing partnership with PayPal and Venmo at some of Live Nation's largest festivals. Buy now, pay later continues to be a major asset to our checkout experience. PayPal was just ranked as the best overall buy now, pay later value proposition in the United States by the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, we processed nearly $5 billion in volume, up 157% year-over-year, with over 25 million consumers using our buy now, pay later services approximately 150 million times since launch.\nAs a result of this robust growth, we believe we have become one of the largest buy now, pay later providers in the world, with a unique competitive advantage derived from our two-sided network. Our upstream presentment continues to grow, with over 280,000 merchants displaying our buy now, pay later on their product pages. The size of our active account base, and the years of transaction data we have on our customers, provides us with an additional competitive advantage from an underwriting perspective. As of the end of Q3, our loss rates remain among the lowest in the industry, with no observable deterioration to date. Venmo continues to be a significant asset in our portfolio, with much untapped potential. We have almost 90 million Venmo active accounts, including 57 million monthly active accounts. Total payment volume on Venmo grew 6%, while Venmo commerce volumes grew 150% in Q3.\nWe began to onboard charities to Venmo this quarter, which we expect will encourage more giving as we enter the holiday season. As I shared earlier, we are obviously enthusiastic about our partnership with Amazon and look forward to working with their team. In October, we announced the launch of PayPal Rewards, which unifies our Honey and PayPal Rewards programs, and customers now can earn, track, save, and redeem cashback rewards and merchant offers in their PayPal app. In addition, our customers can also combine the benefits of their existing card rewards and offers, allowing them to save even more. PayPal Rewards is ramping in time for peak holiday shopping, and we have a robust roadmap to extend and enhance the program throughout 2023.\nIn closing, I'd like to underscore that we are confident we have turned a corner in our transformation. We will continue to drive cost savings and streamline our processes to improve productivity while investing to differentiate our value proposition, drive market share, and deliver on our commitments. Given a challenging macro environment, slowing e-commerce trends, and an unpredictable holiday shopping season, we are being appropriately prudent in our Q4 revenue guide. At the same time, we are raising both our full-year and Q4 EPS outlook, and expect EPS growth in Q4 to be positive 6% to 8. Given our commitment and focus on driving continued operational efficiency and earnings leverage, we plan to deliver no less than 15% non-GAAP EPS growth next year. While there are a number of unknowns regarding the macro environment, we can largely control our spend and its implication on earnings growth.\nOf course, we are also focused on investing for growth, and we are balancing efficient spend with continued investment to drive future top-line growth. We are excited by the operational initiatives, product enhancements, and new strategic partnerships that position PayPal in a substantially stronger position from when we started the year. I want to thank the PayPal team for the work they do every day to support our merchants and consumers, live our values, and drive our results. I'm also pleased that John Kim has recently joined us as Chief Product Officer. He has deep technical and operational expertise, with extensive experience overseeing product and engineering teams, and has driven customer-focused innovation at scale. We are fortunate to have the chance to work with him to drive this next chapter in PayPal's story.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Gabrielle.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners, and global team for helping us to deliver a great quarter. The strong results we're reporting today demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy to deliver long-term, sustainable growth. Our teams are proving our ability to navigate a dynamic operating environment while also staying focused on our key priorities. We once again demonstrated our resolve, combining execution and focus with growth in our core business. Our results reflect our operating discipline, diversification, and resilience. The power of PayPal is the scale of our global franchise. Our investment and innovation are making us stronger, and we're excited by what we see as we execute against our growth opportunities. I share Dan's enthusiasm for our growing relationship with Apple, and the rollout of Pay with Venmo on Amazon.\nWe believe we will continue to extend and reinforce our leadership in payments, and we are confident that our competitive positioning with unparalleled scale across our two-sided network will allow us to emerge from this period of economic uncertainty stronger. We're proud of the quarter we delivered. We surpassed the third-quarter financial targets we shared with you in early August, and delivered on our commitment of sequential acceleration in our revenue and earnings growth. We're also on track to build upon our operating margin performance in Q3 to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our teams are energized by the progress we have made, and by the increased operational rigor we're bringing to running our business and investing in our priorities.\nAt the same time, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be complex, and we're focused on taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business for profitable growth at scale. This year, we will process nearly $1.4 trillion of payment volume, an increase from $1.25 trillion last year, and a 25% compound annual growth rate from $288 billion in 2015. At this massive scale, we are not immune to macro headwinds. As we close out 2022 and prepare for the year ahead, we're intensely focused on doing everything within our control to anticipate and mitigate ongoing macro risks, and drive robust earnings growth. Given the breadth of our two-sided platform, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we believe we are well-positioned and have the levers available to successfully navigate an economic cycle.\nWe remain committed to meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023 and a significantly stronger non-GAAP earnings growth profile. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our third-quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 12.4% on a currency-neutral basis and 10.7% at spot to $6.85 billion, with each of these metrics exceeding our guidance. The dramatically strengthening dollar has been an increasing headwind as we've moved through the year, and we expect this condition to persist in the fourth quarter. Transaction revenue grew 11.2% to $6.23 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue grew 6.4% to $612 million. This performance, relative to last year, resulted from higher interest income on customer stored balances, offset by lower credit revenue as we lapped higher-than-normal loan servicing fees.\nIn the third quarter, US revenue grew 14.4%, while international revenue increased 6% at spot. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue increased 9.4%, and excluding eBay, 11.7%. Additionally, eBay marketplace's revenue declined 38% to $145 million and represented 2% of our total revenue. Our take-rate performance was very strong, with both transaction and total take-rate improving approximately 4 basis points. Transaction take-rate was 1.85%, and total take-rate was 2.03%. Both transaction and total take-rate benefited from gains from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue, as well as Venmo monetization. Interest income also benefited our total take-rate. Transaction expense came in at 89 basis points as a rate of TPV, relative to 83 basis points as a rate last year. This result was largely driven by the increase in the contribution of Braintree volumes, which are predominantly card-funded, to our overall mix of payment volume.\nTo a lesser extent, funding mix also contributed to higher transaction expenses from more normalized debit card usage relative to 2021. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points versus 9 basis points in Q3 last year. In addition, credit losses were $113 million, or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2021, we released $63 million of credit reserves, which benefited transaction margin and operating margin performance in the prior period by 100 basis points. We ended Q3 with $6.5 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 4%. The growth in global pay later receivables was the largest driver of loan originations.\nThe mix of shorter duration originations from our pay later products and strong performance of our loan receivables portfolio resulted in a reserve coverage ratio of 7.4% compared to 7.3% last quarter and 11.6% in third quarter last year. Transaction margin dollars grew 4%, a reversal from year-over-year declines in the first and second quarters of 2022. Excluding the benefit from the reserve released last year, transaction margin dollars increased 6%. This quarter, we began seeing benefits to our transaction expense from leveraging our scale across the network ecosystem. We expect this trend to continue in Q4 and into 2023. In addition, we're making progress in rationalizing non-transaction-related expense growth. In the third quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, these expenses grew 4% year-over-year, relative to 17% growth last year, driving 180 basis points of operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating income also grew 4% year-over-year to $1.53 billion.\nImportantly, this is the first quarter since Q2 2021 in which we delivered operating income growth. Our operating margin was 22.4%, which was approximately 2 points better than our outlook provided at Q2 earnings. We're particularly pleased by this operating margin outperformance, and look forward to building on this track record of cost prudence as we enter 2023 and beyond. For the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS was $1.08, nearly 15% stronger than our outlook. Discrete tax benefits in Q3 2021 of approximately $0.10 per share created a headwind to EPS growth. Our outperformance relative to our expectations was predominantly driven by the actions we took to increase efficiencies within non-transaction-related operating expenses, and improve transaction loss performance. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $16.1 billion. During the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $4.1 billion.\nRelative to last year, Q3 free cash flow grew 37%. We consider our balance sheet and cash flow to be competitive differentiators, which provide us with significant optionality for value creation. In the third quarter, we completed an additional $939 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have now returned $3.2 billion to shareholders, representing 78% of the free cash flow we have generated. Given our conviction in our business relative to its valuation today, its long-term competitive advantages, and ability to deliver sustainable value creation, we have taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program this year. We believe that share repurchase remains an optimal use of capital for our shareholders while allowing us to retain the flexibility to continue investing opportunistically in our business. We now expect to complete an additional $1 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter.\nAs I discussed during our earnings call last quarter, we've been assessing opportunities for additional credit externalization. We have made progress on this initiative and are committed to securing off-balance sheet funding for a portion of our global pay later portfolio next year. Before I cover our guidance, I'd like to discuss the incremental disclosure that we are sharing this quarter to disaggregate our TPV. In our investor update, we're providing additional information related to our volume mix and how it has evolved over time. We believe sharing this detail is helpful for investors to better understand our business trends. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year and our preliminary thoughts for 2023. First, some context on the trends we're seeing and how these are shaping our outlook.\nAs Dan mentioned, overall, we saw US e-commerce growing in the low single digits in Q3, with deceleration into the close of the quarter. This trend persisted in October. On our platform, as well as in third-party data, we have not seen the early start to the US online holiday season that we saw in 2021. Our guidance contemplates holiday e-commerce ramping through November. Overall, our expectations for holiday e-commerce are consistent with the recent spending forecasts from Adobe, Mastercard, and Salesforce, with growth in the low single digits. We are also closely monitoring channel mix between in-store and online, as well as the mix of services and goods spending. From a market perspective, the US continues to outperform international, and we are seeing weaker performance in the UK, our second-largest market. These factors, combined with the broader macro trends, have been incorporated into our revised outlook.\nWe are lowering our full-year currency-neutral revenue expectations by 1 point, and at the midpoint, raising our non-GAAP EPS expectations by $0.16. Given the current uncertainty in the global macro environment, we believe this is an appropriately sensible and prudent approach to our revenue outlook. That said, our earnings guidance reflects the resilience and power of our franchise. In raising our EPS outlook again, we're demonstrating our control over operating expenses, the diversification of our business, and the benefits from scale to our operating model. We believe that our ability to raise our earnings guidance in this environment is especially distinguishing relative to other public company guidance we've seen for Q4. For the full year, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 10% on a currency-neutral basis, and approximately 8.5% at spot.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency-neutral basis, and approximately 7% at spot. We believe our Q4 and full-year revenue growth guidance is strong given our scale and the macro backdrop. We also expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin of at least 21% this year. For the first three quarters of 2022, our operating margin has declined year-over-year. Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we expect this trend to inflect, and to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion. Our guidance contemplates Q4 operating margin of approximately 22.5%. In addition, we're raising non-GAAP EPS to $4.07 to 4.09 for the year. As we noted entering the year, discrete tax benefits and reserve releases last year in the aggregate benefited 2021 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.54, and are a headwind to our EPS growth profile this year.\nBased on our expectations for revenue and operating margin in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.18 to 1.20. We expect to finish 2022 in a stronger position than we started it, with greater operating discipline and focus. Dan and I are pleased with our improving execution, and we're confident there will be room for continued improvement. However, with our most important weeks in the holiday season ahead of us, as well as ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe it is too early to provide a detailed outlook for 2023 on this call. That said, as we're planning for the year ahead, our framework currently includes the following assumptions. First, that our overall volumes will continue to grow faster than e-commerce across our core markets, and that we will continue to take market share.\nAt the same time, we expect inflationary pressures alongside slowing global growth to weigh on discretionary e-commerce spending, which could continue to be pressured in 2023. Second, we will deliver at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion next year, an improvement from our 50 basis point commitment when we reported results last quarter. Third, our commitment to drive solid growth in earnings per share. Taken together, we believe that our cost savings initiatives, and benefits from higher interest rates, will enable us to deliver non-GAAP earnings growth of at least 15% next year. We believe this outlook for next year contemplates a sufficiently wide range of revenue outcomes. We are firmly committed to executing on the operational initiatives we discussed last quarter, and are highly confident that we will deliver on our 2023 framework.\nFinally, from a capital allocation standpoint, we plan to take a similarly aggressive approach to share repurchases in 2023 as we have this year. In closing, despite the many challenges of today's environment, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate the road ahead. We cannot have more confidence in our people and in the priorities we're executing against. We are just beginning to scale several of our newer consumer and merchant experiences, and work with several important strategic partners in the ecosystem. For our shareholders, we continue to achieve significant growth while returning capital in the form of share repurchases. We're confident that our earnings power and strong free cash flow generation will allow us to continue to invest in our business and extend our leadership position. We are completely focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders and look forward to updating you on our progress.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions. Brianna, please go ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, you must press star and the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. Exciting announcements for sure with Apple, etc. Just wondering on the margins, though, can you talk a little bit about how you're approaching next year? Obviously, as you indicated, Gabrielle, there's a big range of potential scenarios, especially around revenue, but you seem fairly confident in your ability to deliver that 100 basis points of margin expansion, which is a little more than we had modeled. You can talk about what's going into that, what the levers you can pull to make sure you can deliver that, and how that translates into that 15% EPS growth. Thanks.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nHey, James. It's Dan, I'll start off, and then maybe Gabs can fill in around the edges here. First of all, we do feel quite confident in our ability to raise our EPS for the year, and off of that higher total, generate at least 15% EPS growth, which gets you to about, as a first step for us, $4.70 next year. This is really being driven by taking a very prudent approach to what could happen next year from a macroeconomic perspective. There are a wide range of scenarios on that, and everybody has an opinion, but we think it is prudent to plan for a difficult economic cycle and have our cost structure be in line with that so that we can deliver robust EPS growth. Our cost and productivity initiatives are still well underway.\nI'm really pleased with the execution that we've had over the last several quarters. We've been anticipating a difficult economic environment. The team's taken a lot of action across non-transaction-related OpEx. As we said in our remarks, we expect in the fourth quarter, that's going to be flat, and probably slightly negative as we look ahead. As you look into 2023, you see no reason why it will come off of those levels of being flat to slightly negative. If you think about it, our non-transaction OpEx has traditionally been in the mid-single digits for a long time. During the pandemic, that jumped up to 17% in 2020 and about 20% in 2021. We have plenty of headcount. Our headcount is going to be down at the end of this year from where we started at the beginning.\nWe have a lot of efficiencies as our processes get better and better. We are clearly leveraging our scale with our suppliers as well, whether those be our network partners or others on transaction-related expenses. We feel very good about delivering at least 100 basis points of operating margin improvement next year. By the way, at the same time, investing in our high growth, high conviction areas, check out Digital Wallet and Braintree. We think this is a time where market share leaders get stronger. We want to take advantage of this environment that we're in. We are already seeing some of the investments we're making in those areas pay real dividends in our ability to satisfy our customers. We think this is an opportunity for us to take share going forward. We're in a rising interest rate environment. That's a tailwind for us.\nFor many of our competitors, it's a headwind on it. We just think there's opportunities for us to operate more efficiently and effectively, invest, and continue to take market share. Really pleased with the focus and the commitment from the team, making real progress on the cost side and the productivity front, and we'll continue to do so as we go into next year.\nNext question, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, guys. Wanted to talk about the top-line outlook for Q4, currency neutral. We're looking at 9% revenue growth. I know last quarter we were thinking more like 14%, obviously linked to the softer TPV outlook. Can you just walk us through perhaps pieces of that bridge, what you thought last quarter versus what you're thinking now for Q4, given the context of the softer macro? Thank you.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet, Jason. You're right. We took down our full-year revenue guidance by about a point, and at the same time, of course, raised our EPS at the midpoint by $0.16. We had a strong Q3, and obviously, we delivered on all of our commitments. At the end of the quarter, we started to see some slowing, and that came right at the very end. In October, in addition, we didn't see the early start to the holiday season that we'd seen in 2021. We brought down our internal forecast for US e-commerce growth commensurately with that. In the middle of the year, we were thinking about US e-commerce growth for the fourth quarter in the mid-single digits. That's now come down to low singles. That's pretty consistent with what we see from other third parties, and that really is the predominant driver of the change in our guidance.\nNow, in conjunction with that, similar to earlier this year, when we took down some of our expectations around initiatives in conjunction with a lower growth environment, we've done the same. That is also contributing to the 9% FX-neutral expectation on Q4. Of course, we're raising EPS overall. In the quarter, we expect to deliver about 75 basis points of op margin expansion. We continue to deliver on our efficiencies, despite the slower growth environment.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nI think you're also seeing any report that comes out on the macroeconomic environment reaching all-time high. The inflation report in the Eurozone was not great. You're seeing in countries like the Netherlands, which is so conservative, a 17% inflation rate. The UK, which is our second largest market, is really suffering. Our view is that we're still going into winter. Energy costs are going to go up. The low-end income levels and middle income levels are beginning to cut back on their discretionary spend. They're spending so much more on food, on energy, on gas, on rent. We're beginning to see that impact those segments of the market. The high end of the market, by the way, is still spending quite freely, and we're seeing that also in our results.\nThe other thing is we did expect quite a number of live-to-site implementations on Braintree in the fourth quarter, almost a full point of growth that are being pushed into next year. We'll capture that revenue. We just won't capture it this quarter. I think, as Gab said, there are certain things we can control. Those are our expenses, where we're investing, how we're doing in those investments. There, I think the team is doing an excellent job. There are certain things like the macro environment that we can't control, but we need to be ready in a wide range of scenarios. That's what we're laying out for you: a firm commitment around at least 15% EPS growth, operating margin expansion, and continued investment in our high growth, high conviction areas.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAll makes sense. Thanks, guys.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks very much. Obviously, it's a fluid environment, but maybe following up the last question, I think it'd be helpful to know for context how you're thinking about the overall e-commerce environment into next year, how that impacts the 2023 framework, including the underlying volume or revenue growth assumptions that you have to get to those targets. Thank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nLet me start off. Gabs can come in. First of all, Colin, look, I think it's a little bit too soon to have strong visibility into what 2023 will look like. Typically, in a quarter, when you're 1/3 of the way through it, you have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, that's not the case. It's really all about the holiday season and what happens in a five or six-week period that's still ahead of us. Based on what we're seeing right now, based on external reports, based on our conversations with other e-commerce players, you saw another very large e-commerce player take down their revenues in the fourth quarter, we think that e-commerce is going to be pretty muted in the fourth quarter.\nRight now, we are not planning that that comes back for any reason as we look into 2023. I think baseline e-commerce growth will be subdued, but I fully expect that we will outpace it. We've got quite a number of Braintree live-to-site with very large merchants coming up. Our checkout and digital wallet improvements are quite strong right now, and I'm really pleased with the indications from those initiatives. Obviously, Amazon, we'll see what happens with that, but we have a lot of hope for that. Our deal with Apple will certainly be meaningful over at least the medium term on that. Still too early to call. We're going to be very conservative on our top-line assumptions, but we're going to build a ton of resilience into our model. We'll adjust to potential lower growth environments. We can keep our OpEx very well controlled.\nWe've demonstrated that now, we'll continue to enable operating margin expansion next year. If the macro picture gets better, these numbers could improve dramatically, but we're anticipating a difficult economic cycle and preparing for that so that we can invest and deliver robust EPS growth at the same time.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Look, it's really helpful to have the volume breakdown by PayPal, Braintree, more. I know you said, I think you said 4% core PayPal growth, and you're saying you're expecting that it'll be in line with the market. If you could just touch on the assumptions and drivers of PayPal core engagement growth and what you can do there, it obviously looks like you're making progress around initiatives like Passkeys or the Venmo Amazon partnership or obviously Apple. All that should help, I assume, on the checkout experience, but maybe we can have some more color on how much room there is to improve that experience and what that can mean.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, sure. I'll dive really quickly into both checkout and a little bit on what we're seeing on digital wallet. As you know, Darrin, we're already the leader in branded checkout. I mean, we have 8x the footprint of the next closest digital wallet. Consumers are twice as likely to spend online when they see the PayPal button. 80% of the 1,500 largest online retailers across the US and Europe accept us, and our auth rate right now is 600 basis points above the market average. For every 100 transactions, PayPal is going to approve six more than traditional card networks. Obviously, as we've talked about many times, we can do a lot more here. One, we've improved customer perceived latency by 40% in the last 12 months. Our uptime and availability has gone up by another nine. We're approaching five nines of availability.\nWhen we're doing in-app, our early indications from in-app with the mobile SDK is that conversion rates increase between 3% and 10%. Again, it's early days on that, but imagine how significant that improvement is. On the authentication side, Passkeys is a very big deal. Passkeys are going to be accepted not just with Apple. We're integrating through iOS on Passkeys initially, but Google and Microsoft are also enabling Passkeys. That basically enables authentication through biometrics fully embedded into the OS. It eliminates the need for weak or reused credentials, and it removes the frustration of having to remember a password. In one of our recent surveys, 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase due to a password issue. That Passkey could be a very meaningful piece of conversion uplift for us. Of course, we're moving into vaulting and accelerated checkout.\nI've mentioned this already on our digital wallet stats, but it's up 50% of our base now plus is using our digital wallets. That's up over 13% year over year. We're seeing much reduced churn on that, 25% to 33%, 50% greater ARPU, 60% more checkout transactions. We're seeing a lot of our new products in the wallet gain a lot of traction. I mean, savings is early. It's got a 3% APY, but we're seeing a 20% lift in ARPA for those who come into our savings program, 30% lift in checkout. Even things like just like our new 3-2-1 card, because cards are an important part of our strategy, that's off to an incredibly strong start. We've acquired more accounts in the first six months of that launch than we did in the previous 22 months with our 2% cashback offer.\nA lot of things to be excited about in terms of what we can do with our initiatives. That's why we're investing heavily in them, as well as returning operating margin performance and EPS performance to our investors.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep, you bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Good to hear your voices. Hey, Dan, I just wanted to follow up on the Apple-related announcements that you made or highlighted on the call. Certainly, some good progress there. Can you talk a bit more about what you think this unlocks for PayPal in terms of better serving both your merchants and your consumers? Are there any aspects of this relationship that you think could be more impactful, perhaps over time? Where could it go? Also, could you talk a little bit about how that relationship dynamic is, how collaborative this relationship is with Apple? Thank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep. Well, first of all, I think the agreement's quite important strategically. Our two companies have been working on that together for quite some time. I think there are three areas that this really helps unlock. I mean, first of all, enabling our merchants to use their iPhone without any incremental dongle or point of sale terminal around that. All they need to do if they have a business profile on Venmo or PayPal is give us three pieces of information: their mobile phone number, their birth date, and either their Social Security number or their tax ID. That's it. Then they're set up to receive payments in the offline world. Our payment rate there is 2.29% plus $0.09. That is a really competitive rate versus others in the market.\nWe think this can be really especially significant for the millions of customers that have Venmo business profiles and allow us to compete aggressively in an omnichannel world in there. I think there's a big unlock on that. Second, adding Apple to our unbranded flows. As you know, Apple's already on Braintree and on our unbranded flows, but that's just going to make us well more competitive as we go out and sell PayPal Commerce Platform further down into middle market and smaller businesses. It enables us to sell PayPal Commerce Platform more completely. It enables us to offer more choice to our merchants, which is something we've been focused on for years and years now. It also enables the very best integration of our PayPal-branded and Venmo-branded checkout buttons.\nThe ability for our consumers to add their PayPal and Venmo credit and/or debit card into Apple Pay in the US or to use that anywhere Apple Pay is accepted is probably a bigger deal than most people realize. We've been doing this with Google Pay for quite some time, and we've seen, for instance, that Google Pay users in Germany, when they add their PayPal credentials there, there's a 20% increase in their branded checkout transactions. We also have the ability to create temporary digital cards that can even allow us to bring our buy now, pay later from branded checkout online to everywhere a consumer shops. I think there's a lot of really nice unlocks. Apple and PayPal have been working closely on this.\nWe're both excited to put these into the market, dedicate resources to assuring that they're successful, and just create a better value proposition for our mutual customers.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nTerrific. Thank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks, Dan and Gabs. Any more clarity on the at-least part of the $1.3 billion in cost efficiency next year? I'm just curious if that's more likely to come from cost cutting or maybe less investing. How quickly also can you pull the levers to deliver on the 15%? Thanks.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nYeah, you bet. When we talked last quarter about driving at least $1.3 billion in cost savings next year, nearly half of that was coming on the transaction expense side, with the other half coming from non-transaction-related OpEx. I'd say in addition to thinking we can do more, I think the balance weighs more in favor of non-transaction-related OpEx than it does TE at this point. Some of that's based on the fact that with a slightly lower growth environment, some of the benefits that we derive on the TE side are really volume-based in nature. If those volume expectations come in a bit, we would be driving more on the non-transaction-related OpEx side. That said, I think we see a lot of room to go in terms of our initiatives there.\nJust sort of taking a step back, last year, our non-transaction-related OpEx grew about 20%. That was on top of about 17% growth in 2020 over 2019. This year, we're spending about $2.5 billion more in our non-transaction-related OpEx bucket than we did in 2019. We see an opportunity to be a lot more productive and drive more savings there. You'll see this year's marketing dollars coming down. They came down again in Q3 about 1% after coming down considerably more than that in Q2. We'll end up the year with low single-digit non-transaction-related OpEx growth, and I'd expect next year we'll do better than that. I'd expect it to be closer to flat, if not a decline year on year. We're looking for the opportunities we can to continue to drive operating margin expansion even in a lower growth environment.\nWe think that the savings we're finding are really sustainable, and it's a lot more about productivity and using our scale to benefit us. We think we emerge from this environment much stronger as a result of the work that we're doing.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nUnderstood. No, that's all useful. Thanks. Got to say, thank you for slide 6, including the calgary stuff. That's great to have. Is that a one-timer? I'll jump off. Thanks. In terms of disclosure.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSVP and Acting CFO, PayPal Holdings\n\nWe will continue to provide updates. I don't know that we're committed to doing it on a quarterly basis, but we'll continue to update on the mix of our TPV, as it's quite important to understanding the performance of the business. We'll take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one last question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nPayments and Financial Technology Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks so much for squeezing me in. You've announced a number of new omnichannel initiatives, whether it be the announcements with Apple today, the rollout recently of PayPal Zettle terminal in the US, and, of course, continued expansion of your BNPL products. Can you help us think about what all the omnichannel initiatives might mean over time for revenue? Sort of broadly, what are the costs associated with expanding omnichannel? You've talked about freeing up investment dollars from your cost reduction initiatives. Thanks so much.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings",
    "content2": "Yeah. I'll start on that, David. BNPL is an integral part of our checkout strategy. We know if we go into upfront presentment with buy now, pay later, somebody puts us on their product pages as opposed to checkout, our share of checkout goes up quite dramatically. As you saw and as you heard from me, it's growing by leaps and bounds. We're approaching 300,000 upstream presentment. We're one of the top players in any market. Two years after launch, 150 million different loans at over, by the way, 2.2 million unique merchants. What I didn't say in my script is it drives a halo spend of greater than 20%, and +90% of that is incremental to us.\nNot only do we have a great value proposition, but we have a real competitive advantage in knowing our customers. 90% of the people that use buy now, pay later, we have history on, and our loss rates remain low and stable. Today we're live in eight markets. As I mentioned when Lisa asked her question, we think that the ability to take buy now, pay later anywhere you want to shop, whether that be online or in store, is a really exciting part of the evolution of buy now, pay later. As part of being able to put a branded debit or credit card, PayPal or Venmo branded debit card, into Apple Pay, we can also provision a digital buy now, pay later for somebody going in store so that they can pay in store using one of our buy now, pay later solutions.\nWe are also now linking our card strategy, which is a very important part of our in-store. We are moving away from going heavy into QR and doing much more with cards. Imagine paying for something in store and then coming back into your PayPal app and deciding, okay, I paid for that, but now I want to pay for that in four installments or split that payment with rewards or fiat currency. We are really trying to imagine buy now, pay later as being fully omni as a capability, and we think that will unlock quite a bit for us as we look forward.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nPayments and Financial Technology Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal Holdings\n\nThank you, David, for that. I want to thank everybody for the time, for your great questions. We look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Again, thanks for your time. Take care and bye-bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

My name is Savannah, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter 2022. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. And I would now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nInterim CFO and Senior VP of Corporate Finance & IR, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Savannah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website.\nIn discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2022 and comments related to anticipated cost savings, operating margin and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.\nYou can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, August 2, 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel H. Schulman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased to share that in the second quarter, we met or exceeded our expectations announced in April, marking the second quarter in a row of hitting our non-GAAP guidance. We are well underway in a deep transformation of our business to regain our momentum.\nThis transformation is supported by 3 major initiatives. The first is to seize the opportunity to grow our market share as many of our competitors retrench and reorient their business models. We are focusing our investments in the areas where we have tremendous advantage due to our scale and the inherent network effects driven by our 2-sided network. We are doubling down on checkout, our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets and our Braintree platform. These efforts are having their anticipated effect as we, once again, took share in Q2.\nSecondly, we are meaningfully reducing our cost structure. I will discuss this in detail, but over the past 6 months, we have taken action to exit the year with operating margin leverage that will continue to grow in 2023. And third, we have reinvigorated our organizational operating model, and we are recruiting world-class talent to our product, engineering and technology functions. And later in my remarks, I'll expand on our progress in these areas.\nWith that in mind, I'm very pleased to announce that Blake Jorgensen will be joining us as PayPal's new Chief Financial Officer starting this week. Blake joins us from Electronic Arts, where he was CFO and Chief Operating Officer, driving extensive operational excellence and shareholder value. He has also been CFO at Yahoo and Levi's and was co-Founder and President of the investment bank, Thomas Weisel Partners. I am looking forward to working with Blake as we enter the next chapter in PayPal's journey.\nI would also like to thank Gabrielle for all she has done to support me and the PayPal team in her role as interim CFO. I can't say enough good words about her performance, and I'm pleased to announce that she will be taking on the additional role of Treasurer as well as our investor relations and corporate finance responsibilities.\nLet me now turn to our results. Our revenues in the second quarter came in at $6.81 billion, up 10% FXN and 9% spot. Importantly, the shape and dynamics of the quarter reflect the trends we anticipated in our full year guidance. April revenue growth was 7% FXN, May was 10% and June was 12%. And our preliminary revenue growth rate in July further accelerated to north of 14%. eBay payment intermediation was a 400 basis points drag on revenue growth in the quarter, and we anticipate that will drop to approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter and be inconsequential to our results in the fourth quarter.\nNon-GAAP EPS of $0.93 exceeded our guidance by $0.07 as actions we have taken slowed nontransaction-related expenses to 6% year-over-year in Q2. As we discussed during our last call, we have been working to drive productivity improvements across all functions. Our strategy shift to focus on customer engagement from our unparalleled network of consumer and merchant accounts led to significant opportunity for greater efficiency and, importantly, deeper investments in our world-class portfolio of assets. We have narrowed our focus, driven greater productivity and increased our market share gains with profitable growth.\nWe are leveraging our enhanced scale coming out of the pandemic to drive meaningful reductions in unit costs across our supplier base. As a result, we will realize our target of approximately $900 million of savings in 2022 across our OpEx and transaction expenses, which was contemplated in our reset guidance last quarter. We anticipate this reduction in our cost structure will result in at least $1.3 billion of cost savings in 2023, which will result in operating margin expansion next year. These cost savings are not onetime in nature and will continue to benefit the company on a run rate basis.\nWe are also still sharpening our pencils to identify additional areas of productivity improvements across our servicing, marketing and engineering functions as well as opportunities to rationalize our real estate footprint and shift our hiring to lower-cost geographies. These efficiency gains will allow us to increase our investments in our highest conviction growth opportunities, which, as I mentioned, include checkout, Braintree and our digital wallets.\nImportantly, as a result of this exercise and disciplined leadership from our team, we are targeting nontransaction-related operating expenses to be roughly flat as we exit 2022. Consequently, we expect operating margin expansion beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and continuing in 2023.\nAs we said last quarter, NNAs for Q2 will represent our low watermark for the year. We are reiterating our full year guidance of approximately 10 million NNAs. However, as with all of our forecasts, NNA growth could be affected by broader economic factors, given the channels that drive organic customer acquisition may be negatively impacted by falling consumer sentiment and reduced demand for discretionary goods.\nThat said, almost 80% of our volume is driven by 30% of our active accounts, which is why our primary focus is on driving engagement across our base. And here, I'm pleased to report that our transactions per active account, or our TPA, grew 12% to 48.7x per year. And our core daily active users are up over 40% from Q2 2019, a 3-year CAGR of about 13%.\nSignaling its confidence in our business, the PayPal Board of Directors has authorized an additional $15 billion share repurchase plan. We expect the pace of our share repurchases to remain aggressive as we believe there's currently a unique and attractive opportunity to return capital to our shareholders. Our Board is committed to evaluating all options for return of capital to our shareholders. And we expect to share a financial and strategic update, including capital allocation, at an Investor Day in early 2023.\nPayPal is one of the most trusted consumer brands in the world, and we have built a diversified platform with unparalleled global scale. We believe the recent turmoil in both the e-commerce and fintech sectors has created an unparalleled opportunity for PayPal. In contrast to others in the industry, our strong financial model, which will generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow this year, provides us the flexibility to invest and strengthen our competitive position.\nWe are clearly seeing a flight to quality in the market and we expect to continue to drive market share gains. Our share of branded checkout grew in Q2 and remains strong with leading retailers, where we are retaining the share gains we drove over the last 2 years. We continue to leverage our inherent strengths in checkout, which include our base of more than 35 million active merchant accounts with billions of financial instruments vaulted across PayPal and Braintree.\nWe are currently testing our new mobile SDK, software development kit, which enables native in-line checkout, removing friction to make our payment experiences faster and more convenient. And we are also enhancing our checkout user experience to better serve our nearly 400 million consumer accounts by surfacing the most relevant funding instrument based on past purchase behavior, merchant category and purchase price, among other attributes. We believe innovations like these will continue to differentiate our value proposition and drive increased conversion for our merchants.\nWe are making great strides in the presentment and global distribution of our branded marks. We have expanded our relationship with Shopify, and we are now powering Shopify Payments in France. In addition, we continue to win large and significant full-stack processing deals with leading merchants across the world, including Shein, Zappos, BetMGM and Carrefour. We intend to press the advantages we have in scale with our portfolio of payment assets to take additional share in this challenging macro environment.\nOur Buy Now, Pay Later products continue to distinguish themselves from our competitors. In the second quarter, we processed $4.9 billion in volume, up 226% year-over-year with over 22 million consumers using our Buy Now, Pay Later services over 100 million times since launch. Our upstream presentment continues to grow with over 200,000 merchants displaying our Buy Now, Pay Later on their product pages. We recently expanded our offerings with the launch of Pay Monthly, which gives U.S. consumers the ability to spread payments over longer periods of time.\nA key competitive advantage for us is our deep expertise and experience lending through all types of credit environments. We benefit from both our scale and long-standing relationships with our customers. We know who we are lending to, and as a result, we have high approval rates and loss rates that are among the lowest in the industry.\nOur PayPal and Venmo digital wallets are formidable assets that drive engagement across our commerce and payments platform. Digital wallet users are twice as likely to choose PayPal at checkout. And we have an opportunity to increase both engagement and ARPA by continuing to invest in commerce tools. As macroeconomic factors such as inflation impact our customers, our services like PayPal Honey are helping consumers make their money go further. Through the browser extension, PayPal Honey serves up targeted coupons and rewards at checkout and through our digital wallet shopping hub at the beginning of the shopping journey.\nWe are working hard to help our customers save money. Already this year, we've helped consumers save over $100 million. In an inflationary environment, these products are increasingly sought after and valuable. In fact, the PayPal Honey browser extension increased selection and conversion at checkout by 18%. And in the second half of this year, we are focused on driving even more savings for our customers by redesigning the shopping hub and our digital wallet and unifying our rewards programs.\nVenmo remains a key growth driver for our business with nearly 90 million active accounts, driving revenue growth in Q2 of more than 50%, with the revenues exceeding $100 million last month alone. We continue to see increased commerce transactions on Venmo with commerce volumes growing more than 250%. In Q2, we signed or launched Pay with Venmo with leading merchants, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, DraftKings, Booking.com and The Washington Post. And of course, we look forward to launching Pay with Venmo on Amazon.\nWe are also hard at work on new initiatives that will increase both scale and engagement, including allowing teens to create their own Venmo accounts. And in September, we plan to launch the ability for charities to establish a profile on the Venmo app to encourage more giving ahead of the holiday season.\nAs I shared last quarter, we are meaningfully streamlining our organizational structure to simplify decision-making, drive end-to-end accountability and make it easier for our teams to rapidly bring innovative products to market. Our new operating model is oriented around our customers. Our consumer business is led by Doug Bland, and Doug joined PayPal through our acquisition of Swift Financial, where he was Chief Operating Officer. He has been leading the rapid expansion of our global credit products, overseeing the introduction of a wide range of products, including our Buy Now, Pay Later services. And he has deep expertise in navigating challenging credit and economic environments.\nOur merchant business is organized into 2 primary areas of focus: enterprise and merchant platform led by Frank Keller and small- and medium-sized businesses and partner channels led by Dan Leberman. Both Frank and Dan have been with PayPal since before separation in various leadership capacities and have extensive product and operational expertise. These changes will ensure we make the necessary decisions and trade-offs to accelerate our delivery of the highest-quality products while driving our operating metrics.\nMark Britto, our Chief Product Officer for the past several years, will retire from PayPal at the end of the year. I'm very grateful for Mark's leadership, counsel and friendship during a period of tremendous growth for PayPal and for the strong bench of talent he has cultivated. An external search to replace Mark is well underway, and we expect to announce his replacement in the near future.\nIn closing, I'd like to acknowledge again that it has been a volatile time for our sector, for our shareholders, for the market and the global economy at large. But we feel this is a unique opportunity for high-quality market leaders like PayPal with strong business models to increase their market leadership. We are laser-focused on delivering on our key initiatives. We continue to take share. While others pull back, we are investing to improve our value proposition.\nWe are finally moving beyond the lapping of both the pandemic stimulus payouts and eBay intermediated payments. And our increasing revenue growth rate in each successive month of Q2 and July reflect this, setting us up to deliver on our second half expectations. We're driving meaningful productivity and cost improvement in OpEx and our transaction expenses, and we expect to see these actions result in increased operating margins as we exit the year, setting us up for a strong 2023.\nAnd we've made significant and positive changes to our organizational model with several additional talented leaders joining our senior leadership team. I want to thank our PayPal team for their continued dedication and commitment. I'm grateful for the outstanding support you provide each other and our customers each and every day.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Gabrielle.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nInterim CFO and Senior VP of Corporate Finance & IR, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. PayPal delivered another solid quarter, meeting or surpassing the second quarter non-GAAP financial targets we shared with you in April. We delivered on our commitment of sequential acceleration in our revenue growth and slowed our nontransaction-related operating expense growth.\nOur results are indicative of the strength, diversification and breadth of our 2-sided global payments platform. Our team remains focused on what we can control. And more importantly, we're committed to accelerating our core strengths and building PayPal for the future. We are guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers and value for our stakeholders.\nOver the past 2 quarters, we have seen even stronger opportunities to advance our leadership position in payments and add to our momentum with our digital wallet, checkout and unbranded processing strategies. Of course, unlike everyone, we're closely monitoring the impact of high inflation on economic growth, consumer demand and sentiment as well as broader global macroeconomic indicators. The backdrop continues to be complex, and we're taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business.\nPayPal's unique competitive advantages continue to drive us forward. Today, we believe we are better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. At the same time, we're increasing our rigor in managing our cost structure and prioritizing higher-return strategic initiatives. We are focused on improving our operating margin profile while investing in our key priorities.\nOver the years, PayPal has experienced serious business and macro challenges and has emerged stronger every time. As we look ahead, we're confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook. We believe we are operating in an environment in which strong and enduring platforms like ours get stronger. That has never been more apparent than it is today.\nBefore discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 10% on an FX-neutral basis, more than 0.5 point ahead of our guidance and 9% at spot to $6.8 billion. At the time we provided guidance, there was an approximately 30 basis point difference between our spot and FX-neutral growth rates, which essentially doubled during the quarter given dollar strength. We expect FX to continue to be a headwind as we move through the back half of 2022.\nTransaction revenue grew 8% to $6.3 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue grew 21% to $534 million. This performance resulted from solid growth of our credit products as well as increased interest income on customer stored balances.\nIn the second quarter, U.S. revenue grew 18% while international revenue declined 1%. In addition, on a currency-neutral basis, international revenue increased 1%, and excluding eBay, 8%. On both a spot and currency-neutral basis, international revenue growth accelerated 5 points sequentially. Additionally, eBay Marketplaces' revenue declined 60% to $166 million and represented less than 2.5% of our total revenue. Our revenue, excluding eBay, grew 14% at spot.\nTransaction take rate was 1.85% and total take rate was 2%, both essentially flat to last year and to Q1 of this year. The blended take rate on eBay volumes declined to 2.13% from 3.22% in Q2 last year. This was offset by an approximately 5 basis point increase in the take rate on non-eBay volumes, resulting from gains from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue, Venmo and lower P2P volumes.\nTransaction expense came in at 90 basis points as a rate of TPV relative to 81 basis points as a rate last year. This result was largely driven by the increase in contribution of Braintree, which is predominantly card-funded, to our overall mix of payment volume. To a lesser extent, funding mix also contributed to higher transaction expenses as a result of more normalized debit card usage relative to 2021.\nTransaction loss as a rate of TPV was 11 basis points versus 9 basis points in Q2 last year. In addition, credit losses were $68 million or 2 basis points of the rate of TPV. In the second quarter of 2021, we released $156 million of credit reserves, which benefited transaction margin and operating margin performance in the prior period by 250 basis points.\nIn the quarter, loan originations increased and we ended Q2 with $6.2 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 9%. The growth in global Pay Later receivables was the largest driver of originations. The mix of shorter-duration originations from our Pay Later products and strong performance of our loan receivables portfolio resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 7.3% from 8.3% at the end of the first quarter.\nOverall, our volume-based expenses grew 30%, which in conjunction with 9% revenue growth resulted in a transaction margin of 48.7%. This was 814 basis points lower than last year and represents a 7% decline in transaction margin dollars. Excluding the benefit from reserve release last year, transaction margin dollars declined 2% or 564 basis points as a rate, which was primarily driven by TPV mix.\nStarting in the back half of this year, we expect to begin seeing benefits to our transaction expense from leveraging our scale across the network ecosystem. In addition, we have directed our focus on rationalizing nontransaction-related expense growth. In the second quarter, overall, these expenses grew 6% year-over-year, relative to growth of 27% in the second quarter of 2021.\nNontransaction-related expenses represented 29.6% of revenue, an improvement of approximately 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. The growth rates for customer support and operations, sales and marketing and technology and development expenses were meaningfully lower than last year. Notably, sales and marketing spend declined 7% year-over-year in the second quarter, following a 68% increase in Q2 last year.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $1.3 billion. Our operating margin was 19.1%, which is nearly 1 point better than our outlook going into the quarter. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS was $0.93, $0.07 stronger than our expectations. In the quarter, we faced an approximate $0.11 per share headwind from the release of credit reserves last year. Our outperformance was predominantly driven by lower nontransaction-related operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate.\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.6 billion, which includes approximately $6 billion of cash we estimate is needed to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements. Our cash position is inclusive of $3 billion in proceeds from debt we issued in May. Approximately half of the proceeds from this offering were used to refinance upcoming maturities coming due in September 2022 and June 2023. Importantly, through this transaction, we were able to extend our weighted average maturity by approximately 5 years while increasing our average bond coupon by only 70 basis points.\nDuring the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $2.3 billion. In the second quarter, we also completed an additional $750 million in share repurchases, bringing 2022 year-to-date repurchase activity to $2.25 billion, representing approximately 95% of free cash flow generated so far this year. We have taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program over the past several quarters. We continue to believe that share repurchase remains an excellent use of capital for our shareholders.\nAnd as Dan mentioned, our Board recently approved a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with the $2.8 billion remaining on our 2018 repurchase authorization, this brings our aggregate outstanding authorization to nearly $18 billion. Given our desire to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our business, we will continue to be opportunistic with the pace and quantum of our share repurchases.\nOverall, this year, we plan to return 75% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, as we look to optimize our capital allocation and increase our flexibility, we are renewing our focus on credit externalization opportunities. Our last significant credit externalization event occurred in July 2018 when we closed the sale of our U.S. consumer revolving credit portfolio to Synchrony.\nSince that time, the composition of our on-balance sheet credit portfolio has changed meaningfully. While today, credit receivables represent about 7% of overall assets versus 17% at the time of the Synchrony transaction, funding our credit products continues to require an increasing amount of our free cash flow.\nOur credit products are an important driver of customer lifetime value and engagement. In addition, we believe they represent best-in-class products in each of the key credit categories in which we compete. That said, to optimize the use of our balance sheet and remain maximally capital efficient, we're assessing opportunities for additional strategic credit externalization. And we'll update you on our progress as we move through the back half of the year.\nI would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. When we provided guidance last quarter, we contemplated that there would be a challenging macro environment for the balance of the year. As everyone has seen across the market, macro conditions remain highly dynamic. We guided last quarter to a range of 11% to 13% revenue growth, and given today's environment, we think it's important to be conservative.\nAccordingly, I would point you to the lower end of that range on a currency-neutral basis. While the macro remains uncertain, I also want to underscore that we have strong momentum across the business with accelerating revenue growth from April to May to June and now through July, and the team is focused on achieving our targets for the year. We expect third quarter revenue growth to accelerate 2 points to 12% on a currency-neutral basis and that we will exit the year with revenue growth of approximately 14% in the fourth quarter.\nIt is important to note that we had a 150 basis point headwind in the third quarter related to revenue we recognized from the PPP lending program in the third quarter last year. Excluding this impact, we expect our third quarter revenue growth to reach nearly 14%, which results in relatively consistent growth in both the third and fourth quarters. The vast majority of the expected acceleration in our top line performance from the first half of 2022 relates to finally having the tougher eBay compares behind us.\nIn addition, we expect the diversification of our platform and the contribution from new initiatives and our merchant pipeline to allow us to exit the year with our business in a stronger position than how we entered 2022. We are also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance and now expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.87 to $3.97. Our cost discipline in conjunction with our efficiency and prioritization initiatives are enabling us to drive this improved earnings performance.\nWe also expect that this progress will allow us to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2023. In addition, we remain on track to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow this year.\nIn closing, we're pleased with the progress we're making across many fronts. We're advancing our strategic priorities and, at the same time, sustainably improving our cost structure. The cash flow generating power of our business is a strategic competitive advantage and continues to give us a high degree of flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline. We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.\nAnd while we are not immune to economic headwinds, we will continue to deepen our focus, invest for the long term and strengthen our competitive advantages. Finally, I'd like to welcome Blake to PayPal. I'm absolutely thrilled that he'll be leading our finance organization and I look forward to supporting him.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Dan.\n\nDaniel H. Schulman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gabs. So before we start the Q&A section, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide some color on the discussions we've had with Elliott Investment Management. First of all, the discussions have been both constructive and collaborative, and we appreciate the partnership we've built with Jesse Cohn and his team. We are completely aligned in our mutual goal to maximize shareholder value, and we are substantially aligned on the areas of focus for achieving our objectives.\nOur discussions are focused on operational improvements, revenue-generating investments and capital allocation, and they are consistent with our short- and long-term objectives and plans. We've been working on a number of initiatives such as improved profitability and return of capital and we appreciate Jesse's collaboration and input on these important topics.\nAnd as we discussed, we're pleased to announce the following: approximately $900 million of cost savings in 2022 across operating and transaction expenses, with savings potential of at least $1.3 billion through fiscal year '23; an invigorating capital return program, including a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, full evaluation of capital return alternatives; and an upcoming Investor Day in early 2023 to share operational, capital allocation and strategic updates.\nWe continue to engage with Jesse and his team at Elliott, and they have communicated that their investment is a vote of confidence in our strategy, in our management team and our ability to generate long-term value for shareholders. We have also entered into an information sharing agreement to maintain our collaboration across the previously mentioned initiatives, and we look forward to our continued partnership.\nThat's the extent of our comments on Elliott's position in PayPal. And now I'd like to turn it over to the operator to hear your questions on other areas of our business. Thanks very much, and operator, let's open it up for questions.",

Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSenior VP and, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, PayPal\n\nThank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's Earnings Conference Call for The First Quarter of 2022.\nJoining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO, and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures.\nYou can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022, and our medium-term outlook. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.\nYou can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 27, 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nThanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We obviously have a lot to cover today, but before I begin my formal remarks, I want to start by saying how dismayed we are at the atrocities happening in Ukraine. Early on, we suspended our transactional services in Russia and worked quickly to enable PayPal's send and receive services in Ukraine.\nSince then, our platform has enabled approximately $100 million to be sent to Ukrainian citizens and refugees. In addition, thanks to the generosity of our community, nearly half a billion dollars has been sent over our platform to leading nonprofit organizations supporting Ukraine. It is in times like these that we are most reminded of the essential role our platform and services provide to those most in need.\nThis afternoon, in the interest of time, I'm going to briefly cover our first quarter results before I provide a strategic update and discuss our outlook for the quarter and year ahead. We have provided additional coverage of our Q1 results in our investor update presentation. As all of you know, after almost seven years at PayPal, John Rainey will be leaving the company to join the leadership team at Walmart.\nI'm happy for John, and I'm not surprised that the Fortune One company has recognized all that John has done to help build PayPal into what it is today. John, I'm going to miss you, and I wish you the very best of success and happiness in your next chapter. I also want to say that I'm thrilled that the board has appointed Gabrielle Rabinovitch as interim CFO. The three of us are here together, and we will be handling Q&A as a team. I want to begin my prepared remarks by acknowledging that our shareholders expect more from us than our track record over the past several quarters has delivered, and I take full accountability for that.\nNavigating through the pandemic and an uncertain macroeconomic environment with resulting shifts in consumer behavior has made visibility more challenging, but we need to do better, and you will hear more from us today about delivering on our commitments. Before we talk more about our go-forward focus, let me touch on our Q1 results. I'm pleased to report we delivered solid results that exceeded our guidance on revenue and earnings.The first quarter of 2021 was the strongest in our history, with 31% spot revenue growth and 84% non-GAAP EPS growth.\nAnd despite lapping this growth, revenues increased 7% to 6.48 billion and increased 15%, excluding eBay. US revenues grew 20%, and international revenue decreased 5%. Ex-eBay international revenue grew 5%, which was on top of 47% growth in Q1 last year. Volume-based expenses increased 25% and represent 49% of revenue versus 42% of revenue last year.\nThis uptick of approximately 700 basis points resulted from increased funding costs driven primarily by volume mix and lapping the release of $84 million of credit reserves. Non-transaction-related expenses grew 8% in the quarter and represented 30% of revenue, which was flat to last year. Investments in technology and development were offset by leverage in our other non-transaction operating expenses.\nWe delivered non-GAAP EPS of 88 cents in the quarter, absorbing an incremental 3 cents of earnings pressure due to our suspension of transactional services in Russia. We also generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.5 billion in capital to stockholders through share repurchases. As I shared last quarter, we are increasing our emphasis on incremental engagement across our existing customer base while continuing to add higher-value accounts.\nIn Q1, we added 2.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, bringing our total active base to 429 million. Our transactions per active account grew 11% to 47. We continue to be pleased with our buy now, pay later franchise, which is seeing persistent market share gains. We did 3.6 billion in volume in Q1, up 256%, with over 18 million consumer accounts choosing this funding option since launch. And we are seeing increased merchant penetration and upstream presentment, which will allow us to continue to deliver strong results.\nIn Q1, Braintree outperformed again, with volumes growing 61%. This growth comes with the success of key customers like Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash, Live Nation, Vineyard Vines, and TikTok. Importantly, for many of these merchants, we are their exclusive or primary provider of unbranded processing. In addition, Venmo delivered strong revenue performance in Q1, with growth of approximately 60%.\nVolume grew 12% to $58 billion on top of 63% growth a year ago. Venmo now has more than 85 million accounts in the US, and our goal in the coming year is to drive more commerce transactions on Venmo while continuing to be a leading P2P platform. We are making progress in driving more pay with Venmo transactions, business profiles, and offline purchases with the Venmo debit and credit cards. And our integration plans with Amazon are progressing, with the back half of the year as our current launch timeframe.\nAcross both PayPal and Venmo, we are working hard to have our digital wallets at the center of our consumers' daily financial lives. Our redesigned PayPal digital wallet app is now installed by over 50% of our base, and our app users are engaging with more features and driving incremental average revenue per account as a result.\nCustomers who use our digital wallet transact 25% more at checkout than users that are not using the app. And over 70% of our buy now, pay later users engage through our digital wallet. We have nearly completed the rollout of our savings product, and we will be introducing additional financial services and commerce functionality in the coming quarters. Our digital wallet, ARPA, is two times that of a customer who only uses checkout, and the churn rate for digital wallet users is 25% less than the rest of our base.\nWe are focused on increasing adoption of our digital wallet and believe it is one of our most meaningful opportunities to drive growth. In addition, working with partners has been and continues to be an important ingredient to our success. We recently renewed and expanded our strategic partnerships with American Express and Citibank.\nOur strong and growing relationships with these important partners and others highlight our commitment to offering our customers choice in how they pay by enabling seamless FI integrations into our products and services. I'd like to now discuss our outlook for Q2 and the year. While we are pleased that we delivered Q1 with a beat on revenue and EPS, 2022 remains another challenging year to forecast.\nIn laying out our 2022 outlook several months ago, we noted that if macro pressures persisted, we would trend towards the lower end of our range, and if we saw a structural improvement, it would push us upwards towards the upper bound. It is clear that relative to early February, the macro environment has deteriorated. Russia, Ukraine, and China are contributing to increased global uncertainty and incremental inflationary and supply chain pressures.\nAnd more specific to PayPal, forecasting normalized consumer e-commerce spending as we come out of the pandemic is exceedingly complex. As a result, we believe it is prudent to lower our 2022 guidance and reevaluate our medium-term outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 9% and non-GAAP EPS to be approximately 86 cents. We expect a bit more than $200 million of impact from eBay in Q2, and we have tough comps as eBay revenue grew as eBay ex-eBay revenue, excuse me, grew 32% in the second quarter last year.\nWe also had reserve releases of $156 million in Q2 2021, which creates an approximate 11 cents headwind to earnings growth. For the year, we now expect 11 to 13% revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.81 to $3.93. Ex-eBay, this represents revenue growth of approximately 15 to 17%.\nIn addition, at the midpoint of our range, this equates to back half revenue growth of 15.5%. Our revised EPS guidance reflects the flow-through implications of our revenue expectations and volume mix. We are now forecasting 10 million net new active accounts for the year. We expect to add positive NNAs to our platform every quarter this year, with Q2 representing the low point.\nI want to share additional context about the work we are doing to increase our operating leverage. Pre-pandemic, we were in the process of simplifying our operating model and enhancing our operating efficiency. The pandemic forced us to put many of those initiatives on hold to simply scale the business and support the unprecedented growth on our platform. We are now coming back to this work with renewed focus, energy, and purpose.\nWhile we are focused on incorporating more discipline into our operating model and driving operating leverage in our business, we are simultaneously investing to grow. We see opportunities to accelerate our growth and customer engagement. We believe our portfolio of digital payment assets is unmatched in breadth and depth, which creates a powerful competitive advantage for us.\nTo extend this advantage and advance our leadership position, our focus on streamlining and improving the way we work is critical and will allow us to achieve more efficient growth. Overall, these efforts will yield significant savings, allowing us to continue to reinvest in the business and drive profitable growth. For the year, we now expect to generate more than 5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we still plan to balance capital allocation between investing organically in our business, share repurchase, and inorganic growth.\nThat said, to be clear, transformative acquisitions are not on our growth agenda at this time. We currently expect that any activity for the foreseeable future will be focused on straightforward deals that have clear and unassailable alignment with our skills and capabilities. Finally, I'd like to discuss our medium-term outlook that was provided at our investor day in February 2021. We have reassessed the feasibility of achieving our revenue and earnings targets.\nThese targets relied on several baseline assumptions relating to both e-commerce penetration and macroeconomic factors that are no longer on the trajectory that we forecasted. As a result, we're withdrawing our medium-term outlook. We will continue to guide revenue and earnings on both a quarter and full-year basis and continue to update you on how we are thinking about our business over the long term.\nMake no mistake, we have strong conviction in the growth potential of our business and our ability to sustainably create value for our shareholders. However, we recognize the need to level set expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. We know the scale of our two-sided platform is truly differentiated and gives us strong competitive advantage.\nWe believe the secular tailwinds from the digitization of payments and e-commerce growth are persistent, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to bring more merchants and consumers together globally than any other company and help them connect and transact safely. We continue to have many opportunities in front of us, given the scale of our two-sided network and the ongoing growth in digitized payments.\nWe will advance our leadership in checkout, continue our work to become the preeminent digital wallet, and bring PayPal's tools to more in-person contexts, all the while investing in our foundational technologies. Hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of millions of merchants value our comprehensive set of products and services. We are investing resources to both improve our existing products and innovate for the future with capabilities including enhanced loyalty programs, package tracking, and returns management.\nWith branded checkout and full stack processing as the foundational elements of our platform and competitive advantage, the opportunities ahead are significant, and we believe PayPal is well positioned to play a leading role in driving the future of digital payments and commerce. We believe we will continue to grow revenue faster than the rate of e-commerce growth and increase our market share in digital payments.\nAt the same time, we will continue to focus on improving operating leverage to support sustained value creation, accelerating the velocity of getting product into the hands of our customers, and driving greater organizational effectiveness by simplifying processes and increasing accountability. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year unfolds. And with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We request that each analyst ask one question and then return to the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and, Senior Equity Analyst, Moffett Nathanson\n\nThank you, and good to hear your voices.\nJohn, we will miss you, of course. And this one's for you, maybe just building on how you just closed the formal remarks. Reflecting back on the challenges over these past six to eight months, what, in your view, are the top three or four things that PayPal really needs to do differently going forward to turn around the trajectory of the business?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. It's good to hear your voice as well, Lisa. I feel the same way about John. Thank you, Lisa. So look, it's been a difficult several quarters for us in accurately forecasting what our business would look like. I will say that over the past five years, we've very consistently gained market share. That's true also in Q1, if you look across the different products and capabilities we offer.\nAnd so I think we need to, one, kind of rethink, and we've tried to start to do this year, our philosophy and methodology around forecasting. And we'll talk probably about that later. I'm sure there will be conversations about that. Second, I think there are less things we need to do extremely well. And so we are really going to be focusing on checkout, and we can talk about that in more detail later in the call, but we have a number of initiatives on advancing our position in checkout and also thinking about next-generation checkout as well.\nAnd we also need to double down on the digital wallet. We clearly believe that's where the future of the industry is going. It's the future of PayPal. It is the heart of what we are trying to do from an engagement perspective.\nAnd so those are the two things that we really need to double down on. I'd say the third thing is we need to go back to where we were before we came in the pandemic with a real focus on our operating model, making sure we simplify and streamline, putting more and more accountability into the hands of our product managers and driving really end-to-end accountability and ownership across the whole business. And so there are clearly a lot of things we need to do. I feel like we're beginning to make good progress on some of the execution.\nQ1 was a piece of that, and some of the metrics are we're seeing green shoots on that. But we've just got to stay focused and keep driving simplification and operating leverage in our model.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tian-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\nYour line is open.\n\nTian-Tsin Huang\n\nAssociate and, Private Banker, JPMorgan\n\nHey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Let me also start by saying thank you to John and absolutely wish you nothing but the best. I'll ask on the outlook. I know Lisa asked a good question on what's going to change, but I'm just trying to better understand the full-year vision to revenue and EPS and where you're landing now versus 90 days ago.\nSo it looks like the eBay assumption is the same. So how much of the change is due to macro factors versus maybe knowing a little bit more about the impacts of your strategy shift? And of course, how much did conservatism play a role, recognizing, as you said, visibility is tough and you have a CFO seat to fill, etc.?\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and, EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nSure, Tian-Tsin. I'll start, and let me first say thank you for your comments.\nAnd I think Gabrielle will probably jump in on this as well, but I'll give a little bit of color to the way that we're thinking about guidance. And so you'll recall, and Dan also referred to this in his prepared remarks, that at the last quarter, when we gave a revenue range of 15 to 17 percent, we very clearly said if things did not improve, we would be at the low end of that range.\nAnd that's a different approach to the guidance that we have today insofar as we are actually assuming that things get a little worse from here. It's been challenging forecasting sort of the return or the normalization of e-commerce trends post-pandemic, and we've been chasing this for a little bit, and we don't want to continue to find ourselves in that situation.\nSo if you sort of contrast where we are today with when we gave that guidance, not only have things not improved, I think very clearly they've gotten worse. We've got a war that's broken out in Ukraine. We've seen more supply chain issues that are acute in places like China. You've got even higher inflation now, which is, I think, disproportionately affecting our customer base that skews more towards discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend. All of these things affect the way that we're approaching the outlook for the year. Gabrielle, you want to add anything?\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSenior VP and, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, PayPal\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, John.\nSo Tynjen, in terms of sort of lowering the revenue outlook, in addition to what John mentioned around just the macro worsening and what that means for our overall growth expectations in our core markets, we also, to John's point, sort of took a look at what we're seeing on our own platform. And that really relates to sort of e-commerce and consumer behavior. It does have that sort of macro intersection, but for us, because we have more of a discretionary platform, we do see a greater impact on the spend.\nAnd so relative to how we started the year, e-commerce globally is slower than what we thought, and we're seeing that come through on our platform. And so we're reflecting that, and that's both in terms of just the spending patterns as well as offline-online mix. So that's sort of how we're thinking about starting the year.\nIt's really not about our overall conviction in the secular tailwinds that support the business, but we want to be realistic about what we're seeing in the year and adjust that outlook for that. The final contributor to it on the revenue side is really that we've recalibrated our expectations on some of our initiatives at PayPal based upon those lower global growth expectations. And so we wanted to have a consistency in that conservatism around what we think our sort of newer initiatives can deliver in year, given some of those macro impacts.\nOn the EPS side, it's really a flow-through of some of these things, but maybe just something I'd call out is from a volume standpoint, we are seeing outsized performance from Braintree. So that unbranded processing mix does play a role in the overall profitability of the business.\nAnd so we're taking down EPS in part for that. In addition to that, we're continuing to invest heavily in the areas that we think are important to drive that long-term profitable growth. And so that's what you're seeing sort of in terms of the overall impact to EPS. One other callout would just be suspending transaction services in Russia does have an EPS impact as well, and so we've adjusted our outlook for that.\n\nTian-Tsin Huang\n\nAssociate and, Private Banker, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. No, that's clear, guys. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolf Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolf Research\n\nHey, guys. Great. Thanks. John, I also want to wish you the best. Hey, guys.\nWhen we look at when we look at the guidance that you guys gave, and I know you withdrew the medium term, which I think a lot of investors expected at this point, but the exit year, if you could just help us understand the cadence of the year and then the exit growth rate implied by the new guide range and maybe a little more on the assumptions behind that exit rate. Yeah.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nSure. Darren, I'll start off there and then we'll see if Gabs or John want to add to it. So as I said in my remarks, what the back half implies with our 11 to 13 percent is a 15.5% revenue growth in the back half. So mid-teens in general with that. And then as we think about EPS, there are a number of one-time events on our EPS growth rates.\nBut when we think about kind of what is an exit as we go into next year, just kind of on a normalized basis, it's probably in the mid-teens as well. And as we think about the medium term, the thing that I talked about in my script is that we've had a long track record of taking share and growing faster than e-commerce. And so as you're thinking about kind of what does that medium term look like, it really depends on your view of kind of where e-commerce is going to come out. We'll take a look, but there are a lot of shifting estimates right now, as John mentioned, coming out of the pandemic, now coming into a high inflation kind of a macroeconomic environment that's uncertain, and the magnitude of that uncertainty is wider.\nWe felt it was best to characterize kind of what the company expects to do over the medium term as opposed to put out any specific numbers.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and, EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nI'll just add too, Darren, that look, no company wants to be in the position of pulling their medium-term guidance, but when you step back and you look at the set of assumptions on which we base that medium-term guidance, they're very, very different today. That said, and perhaps I'm in a unique position to say this, that doesn't take away our conviction and the long-term value and the prospects for this business at all. There are a few companies of our size and scale in digital payments that have some of the unique attributes that we have around our cash flow generation, our revenue growth, and the margin profile that we do.\nAnd so we're not immune to some of these economic vagaries that we're going through right now, but we've got to respond to that. But that should not take away from how you think about our business longer term. And again, we are perhaps the purest play in digital payments, and we're going to continue to invest appropriately to make sure that we stay that way and stay a leader in digital payments going forward.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. And if I can just jump on top of John's points, at some point, these trends tend to turn as well. But when that happens is unclear. And so we know as long as we continue to invest, to seize those growth opportunities, to ensure that our growth remains in excess of that of e-commerce, when these things do change, we'll be beneficiaries of that as well.\nSo we just want to be heads down, focused on the things we control and execute really well against them.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolf Research\n\nThat's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi. Thanks so much for taking my question this evening. I wonder if you could give us an update on the kind of pivot to focusing more on customer engagement versus acquisition. And I guess specifically, do you have all the tools that you need now to sort of execute on this shift? Is there more development or M&A or incremental technology or resources that you're going to need to dedicate to the new strategy, or are you kind of set where you are now to make it happen?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah.\nIt's such a fast-moving environment that we operate in with constant innovation that we're never in a place where we're not going to need to continue to innovate and invest in the business. I think we've made some really important strides in the past year or so with the advent of our digital wallet. We clearly think that the world is continuing to digitize. Yes, there's some normalization between online and offline right now, but going forward, the world continues to digitize. And disparate parts of the economy are coming together, whether that be shopping, payments, basic financial services. And so the wallet is going to be one of the key elements of how we drive customer engagement. And we're going to continue to evolve the wallet.\nIt is v1.0 right now, and there's going to be v2.0 and v3.0, and we've got a number of things on our roadmap that we really want to execute against this year. But we're already beginning to see uptick in our engagement. For the second quarter in a row, we had 11% TPA. Ex-eBay, actually, engagement went up 19% in the quarter. That's a pretty big move in terms of engagement. And you heard the stats that I talked about in my script in terms of the increases in ARPA, the decreases in churn. And as you think about kind of our growth going forward, 30% of our customers generate 80% of the volume on our platform. We're clearly not a subscription business. We're a transaction-based business. And growing those transactions is a huge opportunity for us.\nWe probably today have like 25% of the online financial transactions that a consumer does. And so there's a ton of room for us to grow in that area. I would also say the surest way for us to grow net new actives going forward is to increase engagement. When you're at 429 million active accounts, even with a consistent churn rate year over year—and by the way, we know this year our churn rate will be somewhat higher because we're letting these low-engaged consumers churn off the platform because the ROI to keep them isn't worth it—but the more we can keep people on the platform engaged, the more we'll grow our MNAs going forward.\nAnd so the two big things we're focused on—improving checkout, improving digital wallet—are the things that we'll probably be talking about for years to come, actually. Anything you would add to that? Got it.\n\nOperator\n\nYeah. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to shift over to Venmo for a minute if I could. I know the volume growth started the year at 12%. Clearly, there was a tough comp there. I'm just wondering whether or not any of the new IRS rules around reporting of these transactions is having any impact there, how you expect Venmo volume growth to evolve during the course of the year. I know you started really strong on the revenue side with Venmo at 60% in Q1, so fair to assume you still expect 50% plus revenue growth from Venmo this year?\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSenior VP and, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, PayPal\n\nYeah, Jason. I think we continue to expect the 50% revenue growth for Venmo this year.\nTo your question on sort of the IRS change, I'd say very early in the year, we did see some impact from that. We've worked a ton on customer comprehension and education, so we think that's basically behind us just in terms of what the impact could be. But we also are up against really tough comps. And so last year's Q1 was 63% growth for Venmo. This year, 12. The business has scaled to the point that it's actually meaningfully larger than what our US business was coming out of separation. And so at this point, we continue to expect strong growth, but it's going to be a mix of commerce volumes and revenue as well as the P2P piece. Dan, anything you got?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nI'd just say they've got a strong roadmap ahead of them, putting in business profiles, transitioning that almost into storefronts, enabling charities to be a part listed on Venmo, a full debit card refresh, they're revamping P2P even, improving searchability and other things around that. So they've got—and then, of course, launching Amazon in the back half of the year. So they've got a pretty full roadmap, and I think Gabs summarized all the other points perfectly.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYep. Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. You bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about TPV. When I look at total payment volume in the quarter, I see the dichotomy between the US growth up 21% and international only up 5. So clearly, international is growing slower than the US.\nSo wondering, when I look at the international market, what are some of the factors there that are influencing the growth rates? Is it inflation? Is the Ukraine situation bleeding into other parts of Europe? Is there any share loss? Any color on that would be great. Thanks.\n\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\n\nSenior VP and, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, PayPal\n\nYeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Bryan. I think the two main drivers really are, in first instance, actually very challenging comps. We're up against very, very tough comps from last year. So Q1 of last year, international revenue growth 38% in the quarter, and it was 47% ex-eBay. So that alone is sort of one of the drivers this year. The other big piece really is the eBay component. And so that too is playing a role. So on the revenue side, international revenue growth ex-eBay was up 5% relative to the negative 5 that you see.\nProbably also worth highlighting that China and UK continue to be tough markets for us, and that is both the eBay migration, but it really is also the macro. And so that's one where we're watching it really closely. We did see sort of China revenue down more than it was in Q4, UK revenue down again more than it was in Q4. And so we'll continue to watch it closely, but that definitely does have a macro layer to it.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thanks. And good luck, John.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and, EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nThanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I'd like to ask about competition. Specifically, there have been some high-profile challenges reported for startups in the one-click checkout space.\nCould you talk a little bit about some of the benefits of PayPal Scale that may create barriers to entry among new entrants and where you're most focused as it relates to competition, if not necessarily new competitors? Thank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Well, as you point out, checkout is a hard business. I mean, you've got to be able to scale it, and it's got to be perfect. As you noted, retailers depend completely on a checkout provider, and if it doesn't go right, they can lose a tremendous amount of sales. And so the brand trust we have and our track record over time, our availability, our fraud and risk capabilities have been honed over the last 10 or 15 years. On average, a retailer that does 100 transactions with PayPal, we approve six more than somebody else, another checkout methodology. These make huge differences.\nI'd say the other thing, of course, is that it is a network effects of business. The larger the scale, the more attractive the network is. And when you do consumer surveys, 60% of consumers pick PayPal as their number one choice to do an online transaction. The next closest digital wallet is 8%. So it's not even close.\nPayPal customers are two times more likely to shop when they see a PayPal button. And for smaller merchants, having the PayPal brand is essential because in today's age, you're seeing much more e-commerce sales that are outside of local territories. It's cross-state, it's cross-the-country, it's cross-countries. And seeing that PayPal brand enables the consumer to feel confident that they've got protection and for a business to feel comfortable because we give them seller protections as well.\nAnd so we have a ton of scale advantages and a ton of experience in high auth rates and low loss rates, which typically don't work hand in hand, but they do work that way with us. And look, we are not resting on any of those laurels by any stretch or imagination. We are driving to improve basic hygiene, increased uptime and availability at 5/9 level, taking latency down to low single-digit seconds, simplifying our UX.\nRight now, too often, there's a pop-up that occurs, and it takes you out of the web or the native app, and you don't want to go out and then back into that app. So we want to drive in-context or inline checkout. We know we can even make our integrations easier and simpler by moving more and more towards industry-standard integrations. And we're going to optimize logon through new identity techniques.\nAnd by the way, we are also thinking about the next generation of checkout. The real issue for retailers is not so much can you make conversion better when a consumer gets to the product page or the checkout page, which, by the way, is important because every little bit actually matters to merchants, and we clearly lead in that area. But the real issue is less than 5 out of 100 people who go to a merchant's website actually check out.\nSo there's a ton of drop-off before a consumer gets to the product pages or to the checkout. And basically, nobody has the amount of data and information we have on customers. We vault over a billion financial instruments on our platform, well more than that.\nAnd being able to work with retailers and consumers to surface who that consumer is, obviously with consent and all of that, so that a retailer can customize kind of to every customer coming on, kind of offers or deals or the homepage they come to, is a huge potential next generation of checkout with a lot of interest from merchants. And nobody can really do that better than we can because of our scale and the data we have. And so I think we got a lot of good advantages right now, but we are really thinking about how do we take it to the next level and how do we even reimagine checkout.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks for the very comprehensive answer Dan.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. You bet. My pleasure. All right.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one last question from David Toggett of Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Toggett\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nAnd all the best to you, John. Thanks, David. At the beginning of the pandemic, Dan, you clearly articulated a focus on unified commerce, in particular a major rollout of QR codes at some of the biggest retailers in the country. And more recently, we've seen consumers return to the physical point of sale with increased vaccination rates. Can you update us on how PayPal is positioned in unified commerce? And in particular, where do you stand with the QR code rollout?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. Well, I think we said from the very beginning, that's proving to be very true, that in-person payments is going to be it's going to be a long slog for us going forward. There's no magic bullet to that. We are continuing to increase every quarter the number of retailers that offer our QR codes.\nBut changing consumer behavior to move to mobile and mobile checkout, it's going to take time. It clearly will happen over time, but it's going to take time. And so our view on this is that we really feel like putting quite a large emphasis on revamping our debit and credit card to tie in fully with our app, but enabling a consumer to shop seamlessly. If it's in-store, they want to use a form factor they're familiar with, they can do that, but it ties completely into the app, fully integrated, a little like the Venmo credit card is into the Venmo app. We just launched this 3/2 card, 3% cashback on any purchase on PayPal, 2% everywhere else, but it is a fully integrated experience. And so, for instance, what might you be able to do with that?\nYou might be able to go into a store, pay with your 3/2 card, and then come into the app and do a buy now, pay later type of thing. So flexibility on choice of how you pay, not just doing it instantaneously. You may want to split that way of paying for that through rewards points and fiat currency. And this tying in of both using the mobile phone at point of sale, but also enabling people to use cards and tie that directly into our app, I think is probably a good one-two punch as we think about moving into in-store. Clearly, buy now, pay later is exploding everywhere, and we are really gaining good traction there, good traction on upstream presentment, and more and more people want to use that.\nAnd that plays, by the way, right into our advantages as well because we have 10 years of credit experience. We think we have the lowest loss rates of the buy now, pay later industry, probably the highest approval rates because we know so many of the customers and a really powerful value proposition to merchants. And now we can tie that both online and offline, and that can be a pretty powerful combination.\n\nDavid Toggett\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. Thanks so much.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. And John, you heard it from everybody, but you'll hear it from us how much we will miss you as well.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and, EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nAnd thank you. I will miss you all as well too.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and, CEO, PayPal\n\nYep. And we look forward to working with you in your position as well. Okay, everybody. Thanks very much for your time, and we look forward to talking to you soon.\nTake care. Bye-bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nJoining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO, and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022, and our medium-term outlook. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.\nYou can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, 1 February 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\nThanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Today, I'm going to highlight our 2021 results, but I also want to spend time discussing the opportunities and challenges we face this year. 2021 was one of the strongest years in PayPal's history. Our revenues grew by 18% to $25.4 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS grew 19% to $4.60.\nWe surpassed $1 trillion in annual TPV for the first time in our history, ending the year with $1.25 trillion of total payment volume. We had a record 5.3 billion transactions in Q4 alone, up 21%. We added 49 million net new active accounts to exit the year with 426 million active accounts, including 34 million merchants. In the last two years, we added 122 million net new active accounts, and despite that spike in new users, our transactions per active account grew to 45 this past year, an 11% increase. Last but not least, we generated $5.4 billion in annual free cash flow. With all that said, 2021 was also a difficult year. It was a particularly hard year to forecast. eBay's migration to managed payments happened faster than we anticipated.\nOverall, eBay put $1.4 billion of pressure on our top line, reducing our revenue growth by 700 basis points. Ex-eBay, our revenue growth was very strong, growing 29% on a spot basis for the full year, and 22% in Q4. Exogenous factors also did impact our results. Supply chain issues disproportionately impacted our cross-border volumes and our small business merchants. Inflationary pressures impacted spending within certain segments of our user base. Rising threats from COVID variants cut travel and event bookings, and the elimination of government stimulus had an impact as well. E-commerce growth rates during the holiday season were lower than industry expectations, despite a strong two-year growth rate of almost 50%. We are also lapping some of the strongest quarters of growth in our history. Even so, we once again grew our market share and came within our revenue guidance for the quarter.\n2022 is going to be a year of transformation and investment as we transition from outsized growth driven by lockdowns during the pandemic and finalize the lapping of eBay's managed payments transition. eBay's transition will put an incremental $600 million of pressure on our top line, approximately $400 million in Q1 and $200 million in Q2. In the second half of the year, I look forward to being able to stop adjusting for eBay and letting the strength of our core results speak for themselves. Our growth ex-eBay has consistently been above 20%, and our year-over-year growth rates have been remarkably stable, again demonstrating the underlying strength of our platform.\nAs I take a step back to reflect, it's clear we are in a significantly stronger position than when we entered the pandemic, with the world continuing to digitize, the use of cash dissipating, and the move towards omnichannel commerce accelerating. Our vision of becoming an essential consumer financial super app across payments, basic financial services, and shopping tools is more relevant than ever before, and our tens of millions of merchants continue to look to us to provide a comprehensive platform for them to navigate the digital economy where the lines between virtual and physical commerce are disappearing. The past two years have revealed new insights about our customers. We have seen their behaviors and expectations evolve throughout the pandemic, with corresponding impacts on the key drivers of our business model.\nConsequently, as John will discuss in more detail, we are shifting our emphasis more towards engagement, and towards driving higher value NNAs. Consumers who are more engaged drive incremental sales for our merchants, and they drive growth at much higher margins and ROI. Over time, we obviously still expect to grow our net new actives, but more in line with our pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we fully expect engagement will increase above our current trend lines, while we accelerate revenue and EPS growth throughout the year. Our forecast for 2022 is appropriately measured, given the difficult comps in the first half and an unpredictable macroeconomic environment. We're going to focus our energy on what we can control, including key product and go-to-market initiatives that will enable us to capture the numerous opportunities that are inherent in the secular shift to digital.\nAt the same time, we will drive increased operating leverage in order to enter 2023 with revenues and non-GAAP EPS growing at over 20%. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong, and our team is executing to win. Last year, we launched more products and experience for our customers than any other year in our history. We integrated Honey into the new PayPal app to help consumers shop, discover deals, and new brands. We expanded our checkout capabilities to help consumers pay on their own terms, whether in-store with QR codes, over time with buy now, pay later, or with emerging funding sources like cryptocurrencies or reward points. We acquired Happy Returns to anchor our post-purchase process and make returns easier and more affordable. We expect these investments will continue to drive increasing engagement.\nWe are intently focused on taking our best-in-class checkout experiences to even greater heights. Through our investments, we are making it faster and easier to check out with some of the highest authorization rates in our history. Today, more than 70% of the top North American and European retailers, including more than 80% of the top US retailers, accept PayPal or Venmo at checkout. We continue to grow our market leadership in branded payments, with our average share of checkout among top merchants continuing to increase. Last quarter, we signed new or expanded agreements with Instacart, Gap Inc., DoorDash, Adobe, Oracle, and Salesforce. Buy now, pay later is a perfect example of the type of investment we are making to give shoppers and retailers more reasons to engage with PayPal. Buy now, pay later is available in eight markets, including with PayD in Japan.\nWe continue to see rapid consumer adoption with $3.2 billion of buy now, pay later TPV in Q4 alone, a $13 billion run rate, with Q4 growth of over 325% year-over-year. We've processed 54 million loans globally since launch, with 13 million unique consumers and 1.2 million merchants using our buy now, pay later services. Venmo had a solid finish to the year and closed out 2021 with more than a quarter of a billion dollars of revenue in the fourth quarter, up 80% year-over-year. We are still at the beginning of our monetization journey, with Amazon implementing the option to pay with Venmo later this year. Venmo is turning an important corner and in Q4 helped to drive the sequential increase in our overall take rate. As always, we've got a lot of work ahead of us.\nWe are fortunate that we have so many assets to leverage in a future that is clearly moving in our direction. We have a two-sided network at scale. We are one of the most trusted brands in the world. We have tremendous financial strength with a strong balance sheet, and we anticipate generating approximately $6 billion of free cash flow in 2022. We have a seasoned and experienced team with strong relationships with customers, regulators, and policymakers around the world. I want to thank the PayPal team for all they do, for staying focused, innovating at scale, delivering more product than ever before, with record platform stability and availability in a time where our payment volumes have nearly doubled over the past two years. I'm excited about building on the underlying momentum of our core business, and I know our team feels that same sense of purpose and optimism.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nThanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners, and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding year following our record-breaking performance in 2020. There are several important points that I want to discuss today. I'm going to discuss a pivot in our strategy to focus more on engagement and what that means for our net new actives going forward. I also want to discuss why we are taking a more conservative outlook for 2022 for both revenue and earnings. Lastly, we don't believe either of these items will prevent us from achieving the revenue and earnings growth rates, along with our free cash flow objectives, in the out years of the period contemplated in our medium-term guidance. First, I want to spend a moment discussing our Q4 performance.\n2021 certainly had its ups and downs, but when one steps back and looks at our overall performance, it was really an amazing year. TPV grew 33%, revenue grew 18%, and we generated $5.4 billion in free cash flow. We also added 49 million customer accounts, ending the year with 426 million. Our engagement metric, transactions per active account, grew 11%, an acceleration of approximately 10 percentage points from 2020. Remarkably, in 2021, growth on our platform, excluding eBay, accelerated meaningfully on top of extraordinary performance in 2020. TPV growth accelerated more than 500 basis points to 38%, and revenue growth accelerated more than 600 basis points to 29%. Since 2019, our volumes ex-eBay have nearly doubled, and overall, we've consistently grown volumes well ahead of industry growth rates. We also advanced our leadership position in checkout.\nSince the start of the pandemic, on average, our share of checkout among the largest publicly traded merchants has increased by nearly 200 basis points. Further, in the US, consumer adoption of our digital wallets is several times higher than the next nearest wallet, and our merchant acceptance leads all other checkout buttons by an even more sizable margin. By any measure, we are a leader in digital payments. There are only a handful of companies that generate the amount of revenue and free cash flow growth that we do annually, and we are confident that our long-term market opportunity is greater than ever. In the fourth quarter, total payment volume grew 23% to $340 billion. eBay volumes in the quarter declined 45% and represented 2.7% of total volumes versus 6% last year. Excluding eBay, volumes grew 28% on a currency-neutral basis.\nRevenue in the quarter increased 13% to $6.9 billion. Revenue ex-eBay grew 22%, which is two points ahead of our medium-term growth outlook. This strong performance was broad-based across Braintree, Venmo, Core PayPal, and our credit products. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2020, US revenue grew 27%, and international revenue decreased 1%. Supply chain shortages and eBay's transition adversely impacted cross-border volumes and foreign exchange fees. Ex-eBay international revenue grew 11%. Importantly, on a currency-neutral basis, the two-year compounded growth rate for revenue in the quarter remained consistent with the fourth quarter of 2020, underscoring the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, total take rate was 2.04%, and transaction take rate was 1.88%. Notably, both increased sequentially, reversing an approximately two-year trend of sequential take rate declines. Both product mix and pricing benefited our performance. In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was strong.\nTransaction expense increased three basis points as a rate of TPV to 87 basis points, driven by volume mix, particularly our growth in Braintree volumes, and Q4 seasonality, which increases credit card mix relative to other funding instruments. Transaction losses improved one basis point to nine basis points, which matches the best performance we've reported in our history. Credit losses were one basis point as a rate of TPV versus three basis points last year, driven by our mix of originations, portfolio performance, and $9 million in reserve releases. At the end of the quarter, our credit loss reserve coverage ratio was approximately 9%. In total, we released $312 million of reserves in 2021. Transaction margin dollars increased 6% to $3.6 billion, and ex-eBay grew 18%. Transaction margin as a rate declined 365 basis points to 52.3%, and our non-transaction-related expenses grew 10% in the quarter.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating income was flat in comparison to last year, and operating margin declined 291 basis points to 21.8%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.11. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $16.3 billion. In addition, free cash flow increased 38% in the fourth quarter to $1.6 billion, and we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock in the quarter. I'd now like to discuss our net new accounts and provide more context for our performance and our expectations for 2022. For the quarter, our guidance contemplated generating about 12.9 million net new actives on an organic basis. We had a slower-than-expected finish to the year and came in below our target. There are three factors that contributed to this, which I will discuss in increasing order of magnitude.\nFirst, the more muted end to the year for e-commerce growth, driven by both supply chain challenges, as well as pullback in spending by lower-income consumers, affected consumer growth. Second, in the back half of the quarter, we also changed course on some of our customer acquisition strategies, including incentive-led campaigns. Lastly, and most impactful to the quarter, there were certain accounts that we disqualified or excluded from our net new active number. For context, we regularly assess our active account base to ensure the accounts are legitimate. This is particularly important during incentive campaigns that can be targets for bad actors attempting to reap the benefit from these offers without ever having an intent to be a legitimate customer on our platform. In the fourth quarter, in connection with the increased use of incentive campaigns throughout 2021, we identified 4.5 million accounts that we believe were illegitimately created.\nThis number is immaterial to our overall base of 426 million customer accounts, but it affected our ability to achieve our guidance in the quarter. Now, I want to shift to how we're thinking about net new active accounts in 2022, which is separate and apart from the factors impacting Q4. I'm going to start with the headline here, then provide some explanation. We are evolving our customer acquisition and engagement strategy, and we now expect to add 15 to 20 million net new customer accounts this year. In addition, we no longer believe that the 750 million medium-term account aspiration we set last year is appropriate. I'll explain. Over the past two years, we've added more than 120 million customer accounts to our platform. This is, without question, remarkable growth and a complete step change from our trajectory prior to the pandemic.\nOur strategy for this has been twofold: continue to add net new actives, and increase the engagement of our customer base. Last year, given the strong user growth, we pursued a strategy to retain those customers most likely to churn, as well as attract many more new customers. We also leaned into incentivized customer acquisition tactics to a much greater extent than we ever have in our history. At the same time, we've continued to focus on and invest in areas that deepen our engagement with our customers, particularly as we continue to add new products and services. To assess the effectiveness of these strategies, we look at the impact on customer behavior in the months that follow account creation, in essence, looking at the ROI, or return on that investment spend, from their expected contribution to TPV, revenue, and operating income.\nThese programs are very successful in generating account creation, but overall, these customers have lower engagement and a higher propensity to churn and have not met our required level of return. This dynamic compounds over time as it requires increasing investment simply to keep minimally engaged users on our platform. Similar to a lot of businesses, we have a Pareto dynamic in ours where the vast majority of our volume comes from about 1/3 of our customer base. What this means is that, unlike a subscription model where more users equates to more revenue, in our business, that relationship is much more attenuated. In assessing our marketing effectiveness, our engagement initiatives were considerably more successful than the incentive campaigns. We successfully moved customers up the engagement continuum into higher levels of engagement throughout the year.\nThese strategies had strong returns and, over time, will be important contributors to achieving our long-term revenue per user objectives. Moving forward, we will continue to grow our users, but our focus will be on sustainable growth and driving engagement. To be very clear, this is a choice on our part. We could increase our spend and accelerate our net new active trajectory. However, we believe there are better ways to achieve our financial results. We strongly believe that we are making the right decisions in redirecting our spend toward high-value customer acquisition and engagement channels. That said, over the next 12 months, as these less engaged customers naturally roll off, it will materially reduce our quarterly net adds. Over the next couple of quarters, we plan to supplement the disclosure of net new actives with the addition of monthly active unique user and RPU metrics.\nThese metrics have a more meaningful correlation with our financial results, and we believe this incremental disclosure will allow you to better assess engagement on our platform and the degree to which our strategies are working. I'd now like to discuss our financial guidance for 2022 in the context of our fourth quarter performance and the initial outlook we provided in November. Overall, revenue performance for the quarter came in about how we had expected. October was a strong month, buoyed by some expected full pull forward and holiday shopping. However, the back half of the quarter was weaker than we expected. Consistent with the reported sequential decline in seasonally adjusted retail sales and consumer spending in December, we experienced a softer end to the quarter.\nThe impact of Omicron and the effect of inflationary prices, combined with lack of stimulus, is having an impact on spending and, by extension, our business. This impact is most pronounced on our lower-income cohorts and has continued into the first quarter. The persistence of inflationary effects on personal consumption, labor shortages, supply chain issues, and weaker consumer sentiment have led us to adopt a more cautious outlook. On last quarter's call, we preliminarily indicated high teens revenue growth for this year and said that if we had to pinpoint it, it would be around 18%. We have an incredible business, but we are not immune to the vagaries of the economy. Based on our more conservative stance today, we are starting the year with an expectation for revenue growth in the range of 15% to 17%.\nIf these issues do not improve, it could cause us to be toward the lower end of that range. Should we see improvements relative to what we're seeing right now, it could result in being toward the upper end of that range. The environment continues to be difficult to predict, and this guidance provides our best estimate of the likely range of outcomes. In addition, as we discussed when we reported our third quarter results, our earnings growth in 2022 will be constrained by lapping the release of the credit reserves and a very low effective tax rate last year. In 2021, we released $312 million in credit reserves. This benefited operating margin by approximately 125 basis points, and earnings per share by $0.21.\nOur effective tax rate was 10.5% last year, resulting from favorable discrete items, settlements, and resolutions, and benefited earnings per share by approximately $0.33 for the year. This is compared to an estimated tax rate of 16% to 18% this year. In the aggregate, these factors total $0.54 of EPS pressure year over year and represent a 12-point headwind to earnings growth this year. At the same time, continuing to invest in innovation in our go-to-market strategies is essential. Over the last two years, we've invested nearly $1 billion over and above our historical spend in areas like engineering, technology, marketing, and customer support, all of which have generated tremendous returns for us. This year, we're focused on leveraging these investments while continuing to innovate at scale, strengthening our competitive positioning, and advancing our leadership in digital payments.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst, Aiera\n\nImportantly, we expect to deliver solid leverage in our non-transaction-related expenses in 2022, which will be offset by volume-based expense growth, predominantly related to our changes in our credit reserves. As a result, we expect operating margin to be in the range of 23% this year. For the year, we expect to deliver $4.60 to $4.75 in non-GAAP earnings per share. In the first quarter, we're up against our hardest comps as we grew revenue 31% and non-GAAP EPS 84% in Q1 last year. The first half of last year benefited from stimulus, stronger consumer confidence, and a greater contribution from eBay. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 6% to $6.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.87, which represents about a 30% decline from last year. As we progress through the year, our revenue growth will accelerate.\nWe plan to deliver at least 20% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and exit the year at a top-line growth rate in line or ahead of our medium-term target. In addition, while the trajectory of the economy has been difficult to predict and may give rise to short-term deviations in our expected performance, over the long term, nothing has changed as it relates to our confidence in our business and our expectations for performance beyond 2022. That said, when we laid out our medium-term outlook one year ago, underlying the assumptions was a more normalized, steady-state expectation for overall economic activity and consumer demand. Our medium-term targets simply did not contemplate inflation at a 40-year high, and supply chain issues not seen in my lifetime.\nAs such, 2022 is now off to a slower start than we previously anticipated, and we are taking a more conservative stance on the year. We continue to believe that our revenue and earnings growth rates, as well as our free cash flow objectives, are achievable in the out years of the period contemplated in our medium-term guidance. I want to close with these thoughts. We arguably just had one of the best years in our history when you examine our financial metrics, eclipsing $25 billion in revenue and generating almost $5.5 billion in free cash flow. By virtually any measure, we are a market leader in digital payments, and will continue to grow faster than the market. There are very few companies of our size, with our global reach, with our growth rates, and cash generation.\nWe're in a dynamic industry and one that is constantly evolving, even more so because of COVID, and we are evolving with it. Notably, our strategy as it pertains to engagement and net new actives. Even with the broad diversity of our business, we are not completely insulated from macroeconomic factors that, while maybe impacting short-term performance, have nothing to do with the long-term intrinsic value of our business. We're going to continue to innovate, to grow, to increase our relevance to customers, and focus on the things that we can control to continue to create value and be a global leader in digital payments. Thank you. I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator?\n\nModerator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Wong from J.P. Morgan Payments. Your line is now open.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, thanks so much. I wanted to drill in on the M&As again, if you don't mind. Just what drove the decision here to focus on engagement, focusing on quality instead of growth in M&As? I'm just trying to gauge your confidence here in expanding RPU, as implied in the guidance, both this year and, I suppose, in the midterm, now that the $750 million is off the table. Thanks so much.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nSure, Tien-Tsin, I'll start, and Dan might want to jump in. Look, I'll start with some context.\nWe're a data-driven business, and if you just look at the last year, we did almost 20 billion transactions on our platform. Each of those transactions has hundreds of signals about that transaction. What was the size of the transaction? What was the price point? Was it on a mobile device? Was it a repeat customer? Did it happen after a P2P transaction? That informs our strategy. We analyze that, it informs the strategy, we measure the results, and it creates this feedback loop that we then refine and pivot our strategies as well. What we've been able to see is that when we assess the strategy around trying to retain these very low-engaged users versus attempting to move people up, maybe from the medium-engaged user to the high-engaged user group, the latter is much more effective.\nIt's much more effective for us to focus on engagement. I think it's important to note we are not a subscription model business where there's a direct relationship between our net new actives and the amount of revenue. As I noted in my prepared remarks, there's a Pareto dynamic in our business where the vast majority of our volume comes from about 1/3 of our customers. We think that we need to pivot, to evolve with the feedback that we've received, and go achieve our medium-term guidance a different way than what we initially had laid out. Importantly, there's very encouraging signs that we see around engagement. We've talked about some of those, but when we, for instance, provide a separate product or service for a customer and they're engaging with us in a different way, the RPU for that customer increases appreciably.\nThis is a pivot in our strategy. We think it's appropriate for our business, but it does not mean that we don't have confidence in our medium-term outlook as it relates to both revenue, earnings, and free cash flow.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, maybe I'll just add a couple of things on to John's response. First of all, we did put on 122 million M&As over the last two years, which is obviously substantially more than what our pre-pandemic levels were. Within that, there are always a number that are low-engaged or have done one transaction and nothing else. We drove some programs, incentive-based programs, to see if they would re-engage and then engage back with the base. What we found is that they would do one transaction and then fall dormant again.\nOur view is spending money on lower-value M&As that are not engaged in the base becomes an increasingly expensive proposition over time and does nothing for our revenue growth. In fact, this year, when we're saying that we're going to do 15 to 20 million, there's probably going to be about 20 million incremental, one-and-done customers that roll off. That does nothing to our revenue. That is actually just people coming out of the base that were never engaged. Over time, we feel like our M&As are going to revert more back to pre-pandemic, which was in the 30 to 40 million a year range. Could that change slightly? Could that be more as we go into more international penetration?\nWe're seeing some very encouraging signs, as John said, with the digital wallet, where if somebody adds one more service to the digital wallet, their average revenue per active goes up by 25%. The average revenue per active of the digital wallet user is two times that of a checkout only. We really feel like we are going to invest our dollars in the best way to drive our revenues, our earnings, and in the most efficient way. We have great confidence in the medium-term outlook. This shift is one that doesn't mean that we won't bring on tens of millions of M&As every quarter. It just means that we're not going to throw marketing dollars at low-value subscribers coming in. That, as John mentioned in his remarks, is a conscientious choice that we're making.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. Nothing very clear. Appreciate the thoughts.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYep.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Darren Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Can you touch on the assumptions for your revenue guidance? I know your 15% to 17% is obviously lower than the prior 18% expected as of a few months ago. Maybe, John or Dan, if you could just touch on the magnitude of RPU expansion or consider and perhaps any color on the take rate or other factors, and just maybe any assumptions that might be conservative here. Also, John, just the cadence and trajectory. I know you talk about exiting the year at 20%+ growth rates. Obviously, it's crazy here. Would need a good ramp as the year progresses. Anyway, thanks, guys. Any color on that would be helpful.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nSure. Darren, you packed a lot into that one question.\nI'll try to get to most of it. Look, as I noted, we're adopting a more conservative stance on the year, and that's informed a lot by what we've seen over the last eight to 10 weeks in our business. I think underlying the outlook that we have for 2022 is e-commerce growth. The consensus estimates that we see are in kind of the 10% range, so that's sort of a fundamental assumption to start with. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've seen weakness around spending in our lower-income cohorts. Imagine for us, the percentage of our user base is pretty similar to what you see just like in the US overall. It is a large percentage of our user base, and this was a cohort that certainly benefited from stimulus in prior periods earlier this year.\nWe're seeing the effects of inflationary pricing around that, where there's a more elastic demand curve around that. Certainly, with higher-income cohorts, you've got a more inelastic demand curve, and that's a lower percentage of our base. Generally speaking, I don't think people are going out and buying boats with Venmo. Maybe they are, but this has had an impact on our business. When we provide that range of revenue guidance for the year, if this persists and doesn't improve, then it's going to be at the lower end of that range. If it improves appreciably, then it's the upper end of that range. If you take the midpoint, we do have some expectation that some of the supply chain issues and inflationary pressures that we've seen right now improve in the back half of the year.\nWith respect to cadence, the first half of the year clearly is the most difficult from a year-over-year comp perspective, most notably because of the impact that eBay has on our business. Dan talked about in his prepared remarks sort of the impact that it has at $600 million in the first quarter. As we get that—I'm sorry, first half. I'm sorry, first half. As we get past that and also at the same time begin to see some of the benefit from some of our new product initiatives roll out through the year, the second half will be much better. Look, we want, as much as anyone, to demonstrate to all of you the power of our business. We are very much looking forward to the back half of the year and an exit rate that is much more in line with our medium-term guidance.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nDarren, I think also if you uncouple the headline revenue numbers from our revenue numbers ex eBay and look at it, whether it be in the fourth quarter, 22% revenue growth ex eBay, growing over 27% revenue growth ex eBay from a year ago. You look at that two-year CAGR, it's about 25% CAGR. You look in the first quarter, which is our low quarter of the year, and ex eBay we're growing revenues 13% on top of 38% revenue growth ex eBay a year ago. Add the two up, you've got a two-year CAGR of about 25% again. What I was saying in my remarks is that our business ex eBay is remarkably consistent, and our two-year CAGRs are also remarkably consistent. We're lapping eBay, which goes away by the end of June as we go into the back half of the year.\nWe're also lapping our two strongest quarters of growth in the first and second quarter. Just as we look at the math of that, and then on top of that, obviously all the initiatives that we're doing, we see growth rates exceeding 20% plus as we exit the year. I think if you look behind the headline numbers, you can see those numbers have maintained their strength quarter over quarter. Right. Understood. Thanks, guys. Yep.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Keith from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the take rate. It did stop, I think, a two-year decline.\nJust thinking about it going forward with Venmo monetization, especially Pay with Venmo being a factor, thinking about pricing, if there's any other benefits domestically or internationally there, and then mix P2P versus branded and Braintree. It looks like from the guide that take rate, the moderation of take rate going down also alleviates there. Just thinking about those factors, John, maybe you could help us with that.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nSure. Well, we were pleased to see the sequential increase in take rate in the quarter versus the third quarter. I do think it sort of underscores some of the strength in our business, particularly around pricing, and also, as Dan noted, Venmo. Quite excited to see that Venmo, having achieved its roughly $900 million in revenue last year, is starting to be a contributor to take rate. We've been saying this for some time.\nWe're glad to actually show the results. I don't think it's fair to assume, though, Brian, that every quarter we're going to see a sequential increase going forward, but it's a step in the right direction. I think maybe a better way to think about take rate for this year is really looking at the factors that drove the year-over-year change. Of course, year-over-year take rate declined. If you look at that decline of 17 basis points, roughly half of that was related to eBay. Certainly, that goes away as we get into the back half of the year. The other next largest contributor, which was about four or five basis points related to that decline, was a decrease in foreign exchange fees that we monetize on cross-border transactions. That sometimes goes up.\nIf you look at the core business, there's actually a very small change in what's happening with take rate. Quite pleased about that. I think it really, when you also overlay on that the pricing change that we made that contributed to that, underscores the value proposition and how that resonates with our customer base. We're seeing users becoming more loyal to brand ecosystems like ours. Look, when side by side, given the choice to choose PayPal or other wallets, more than 50% of the time, people are choosing PayPal. This shows the strength of our business, the ubiquity, the network effect of it, and that's translating into the effect on our take rate.\nFrankly, we're just pleased to see that we don't have some of the noise that's been persisting in that comparison over the last couple of years. We'll get into much cleaner compares in the back half of next year.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. I think I'll just expand on one part of John's remarks. I mean, if you look at Venmo exiting the year with $250 million of revenues growing at 80% plus, I mean, as we think about Venmo revenues this year, we can see their revenues growing another 50% plus as their average revenue per active continues to grow. I think when we look at a bunch of things that before were putting pressure on take rate, and now we're seeing the opposite occur, I think that obviously bodes well, at least on the pressure on take rate, if not the stabilization of it.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYep.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Moffett Nathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Well, it's been a couple of tough quarters here coming out of the pandemic. You've highlighted, of course, in detail the shift from NNA growth to RPU growth. Beyond that shift, just taking a step back, what are some of the other strategic and operational adjustments you've been making now, or you are making, in order to adjust to this new world and re-accelerate growth as you look out later into 2022?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYep. Lisa, there's sort of a little bit of a conflation between end of pandemic and us entering into the eye of the eBay transition, which happened concurrently.\nYou're coming out of that, you're lapping very strong growth quarters for us, and we're going into eBay, and the pandemic is beginning to end, and people are conflating a lot of that, which is why I was trying to point out that the core business, ex eBay, has been pretty consistent as we've looked over the last several quarters. Clearly, the lapping is going to have an impact, although a lessening impact in the first half of this year until we move into the back half. I would say, though, the other big thing, Lisa, that we've talked about quite a number of times is sort of the ascendancy of digital wallets, of financial super apps in checkout. There have been numerous studies. J.P. Morgan Payments just put out one, Payments just put one out, where you're seeing digital wallets take increasing share at checkout.\nClearly, there is no other digital wallet close to us in terms of scale. There is overwhelming consumer preference for PayPal in those wallets. Our super app is showing extraordinarily promising early results. We only rolled that out fully in the middle of October across all of iOS and Android, so we're three or four months into it. What are we seeing? We're seeing double the average revenue per active account when somebody uses our app versus just checkout. When somebody uses the app, their propensity to churn is 25% less. The discoverability and first-time users of people coming into the app, crypto is up 40%. In-app donations are up 300%. People coming into our shopping tab is up 35%. People going from the shopping tab to merchants to shop is up over 700%.\nWe are really encouraged by what we are seeing on the app. By the way, the app, only about 50% of our base has the app right now, so it still has quite a bit of ways to go to penetrate. We want to spend marketing dollars on moving people into that app. Inside the app, things like bill pay, like you and I have talked about many times, we're seeing a 200% increase in first-time users there. We want to make sure that people can discover the services, because every time they add another service, it grows ARPA by 25%. We are going to focus heavily on digital wallet.\nWe're going to continue to focus on checkout because checkout is the bread and butter of PayPal, and we have a best-in-class experience, and we feel there are numerous ways we continue to improve that. We're going to increase buy now, pay later capabilities, which is on a tremendous roll, and also move into a focused set of international markets from leveraging the LISA extension we just got in China for an incremental five years, leveraging off the PayD acquisition in Japan, and really looking at markets like Mexico and potentially Brazil to accelerate. A number of things that we're very focused on.\nThe final thing that I'd say that John mentioned in his script and I did in mine as well is that we think there is the opportunity for significant increased operating leverage, utilizing our scale and having our OpEx growth move back more towards normalized growth that we had pre-pandemic, which we think will help expand margins as we go forward. That scale is clearly going to enable us to leverage improved unit economics going forward. Those are kind of the operational changes where we're focused and why we have such confidence that as we go through the year, you'll see acceleration of revenues and earnings exiting at 20%.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYep, you bet.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kopferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nI know you said that you're positioned to achieve the medium-term revenue and EPS targets over the last three years of the five-year guidance period. Are we to assume that you expect to be below those levels when we look at the five-year CAGR basis in its entirety? I guess, if not, if you still think you can achieve these targets on the five-year basis, what would really drive the necessary increase in engagement? Thank you.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nSure, Jason. It's good to speak with you. I appreciate the clarifying question. Look, anytime you put out a longer-range plan over multiple years, it's rare that anyone ever assumes a business cycle in there. Not that we're exactly going through a business cycle, but we're certainly seeing some macroeconomic pressures on our business that were not contemplated at the time that we did our guidance.\nYou are correct in that we have confidence that we can achieve those growth rates of 20% revenue and 22% earnings growth in the out years beyond 2022. Because we have not done that in the first two years of that, you're correct mathematically, that CAGR, that compounded annual growth rate, is much more challenging. When you step back and you think about the core earnings power of the business, the core growth opportunities that we have, look, e-commerce is still going to grow. We're still seeing a pull forward around that. We're still seeing the increase in digital payments, the primacy of the digital wallet. All of these things benefit us, and I would say even benefit us even more because of the scale and brand that we have.\nWe shouldn't conflate changes in real disposable income of people with digitization trends, which benefit our business. I would argue that our competitive positioning has never been stronger. We're very focused in 2023, 2024, and 2025 on demonstrating that we can achieve those growth rates.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. I appreciate the clarification.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks so much. This was touched on a bit earlier, but given the 2022 headwinds you've discussed, what are some of the structural changes you see sustaining as we enter 2023? For example, you've called out 20% plus expected revenue growth as you exit 2022.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst, Aiera\n\nRelated to that, with the pivot to increased focus on growing engagement, what's the timeline of new applications we should watch for in the expansion of the PayPal super apps? Let's see. Where to start?\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO and EVP Global Customer Operations, PayPal\n\nYeah. Well, maybe I'll start with the first part of your question, David, on some of the structural changes. We've covered this a little bit in a couple of questions, but we continue to see a movement, particularly in checkout, or gravitation towards digital wallets versus other ways to pay. In fact, in some studies, it would suggest that PayPal is second only to debit in front of credit in terms of preference from consumers. As I noted earlier, you're beginning to see more and more preference for brand ecosystems.\nWe think that's only going to become more relevant as we go forward, which is part and parcel to why we're emphasizing our digital wallet strategy so much. When someone is using our app, is using our digital wallet, they're much more likely to be engaged with us in other parts of our ecosystem, including offline transactions. All of these things, I think, are structural changes related to the pandemic. Getting the timing precisely correct on when we reach that pivot or that step function change is sometimes difficult. I don't think anyone would argue that we are continuing down that trend, and it's only been accelerated during the pandemic.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal",
    "content2": "I'll just add to it a couple of things. One, obviously, we feel like supply chain issues will work their way through. This actually is impacting quite profitable revenue streams for us like cross-border.\nWhen we look at export out of China, that's double-digit negative, and it's typically double-digit positive for us. That will turn its way around going forward. We know some of these things are temporal and will change over time, but we want it to be measured in the guidance that we put out for this year. On the digital wallet, we put out a ton of new functionality out there. We just started to ramp the high-yield savings product that we're introducing with Synchrony that started at the end of January. We're aiming to be 100% ramped with that by the end of Q1, early Q2. We have quite a number of people on the waiting list for that.\nWe want to really spend a lot of our efforts this year enhancing each of those various products and services to create best-in-class value propositions around every single one of them. I think we have a really comprehensive, good first step of our digital wallet. I think each of these areas can be linked better to each other. The value propositions can improve. We'll add incremental features over time. Really, our opportunity this year is to expand our app penetration because we see what happens when that occurs. When people are in the app, introduce them to more and more services because that has a tremendous amount of leverage in the business model.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah, you bet.\n\nModerator\n\nWe have time for one last question from Timothy Chardo from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question.\nWhen we think about your revenue growth, we like to think about what Venmo could contribute, and then we like to think about what the onus is on sort of the rest of the business, if you will. I know you mentioned that Venmo did roughly $250 million in Q4, and I think it was around that $900 million for the full year. Daniel alluded to this earlier in terms of growth for next year. What could you tell us in terms of what is implied for next year's or for fiscal 2022 in terms of Venmo growth and revenue monetization, and how that might look into 2023 and beyond as well?\n\nDan Schulman\n\nPresident and CEO, PayPal\n\nYeah. I think this year, we're contemplating 50%+ revenue growth for Venmo on top of what it did this year. Obviously, they're continuing to add incremental services.\nEventually, you're going to see Venmo have a lot of the capabilities that the PayPal super app has because that consumer base loves Venmo and wants to live more and more of their financial life on the app. We have over 83 million people using Venmo right now in the US. Think about that as a percentage of the population. That's one out of every 3.5 people in the US is using Venmo right now. We obviously have plans to take that overseas. We're going to be rolling out Venmo with Amazon, with Starbucks, with DoorDash. I mean, there are quite a number of very high-profile merchants that are going to be implementing pay with Venmo on top of all of the things that they did last year. We've got a lot of promise yet to go.\nAs I mentioned, I feel like we're in the beginning stages of the monetization progress. The team is executing extremely well against both their objectives, but really importantly, against their roadmap as well. I think you just continue to see Venmo grow. By the way, when it grows, obviously, its ARPA grows. As I mentioned in my remarks, it starts to add to our ability to grow take rates, or at least that adds to an upward pressure on take rate as opposed to a downward one. I think that was our final question. I do want to thank everybody for all of your great questions. We really appreciate it. We realize there's a lot of information that we put out today. We want to thank you for your time as well.\nWe look forward to speaking with all of you soon, meeting with you in person. Again, thank you for your time. Take care, and bye-bye.\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

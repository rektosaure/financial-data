My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Inc. Q3 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nMr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2025 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.\nYou can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Devin. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 15% overall, and Value-Added Services & Solutions net revenue was up 22% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. Our solid performance is a reflection of our winning strategy, our market-leading innovation and focused execution. We continue to see healthy consumer and business spending in the quarter with the macroeconomic environment still generally supportive. Inflation levels have remained fairly steady and labor markets remain well balanced. Financial markets were near record highs, further contributing to the wealth effect, which helps stimulate spend. Given this backdrop and our diversified business, we are positioned well for ongoing success.\nIn looking at the quarter, our drumbeat of wins continued. Our partnership approach, combined with our differentiated payments propositions and value-added services and solutions continues to drive wins. This quarter, we have multiple co-brand wins with large airlines and retailers, including Japan Airlines, the [ Comair ] in Mexico and Uni President Group in Taiwan. We have also expanded our relationships with bank partners globally, a testament to the unique value we bring. In the Nordics, we have renewed our strategic partnership with Nordea on card issuance and services capabilities. And we're happy to announce that Mastercard will be neobank's exclusive network partner in the U.S. as that card program launches, this builds up on our extensive partnership across the Americas.\nEarlier this year, we unveiled the Mastercard World Legend card designed specifically for the ultra-high net worth individual. Also launched the Mastercard collection, a set of globally connected premium benefits and experiences for our World, World Elite and World Legend cardholders. This combined differentiated value proposition helped us win several key affluent portfolios around the world, including First Abu Dhabi Bank in the UAE, Saudi [indiscernible] Bank and Saudi National Bank and Doha Bank in Qatar. In Brazil, we are partnering with several banks, including Itau, Banco do Brasil, C6 Bank and [ PayTG ] on new affluent portfolios, reinforcing our strong credit position in that key market.\nMoving on from our recent wins. We are focused on executing against our 3 strategic priorities to unlock long-term growth. I'll touch on each, starting with consumer payments. The consumer secular opportunity is tremendous with $11 trillion in GDV and 1.5 trillion transactions still happening in cash and check around the globe and even further opportunity with China and a counter account bill payments. We are targeting these flows by expanding our acceptance footprint across underpenetrated verticals and by opening closed-loop payment networks.\nLet's look at the rent vertical. The volume of rental payments globally is substantial. Today, most of the payments are paid through check or ACH are now are recurring in nature, so naturally a focus for us. Through our co-brand and services capabilities, we have successfully unlocked acceptance at scale with partners. This quarter, we partnered with [ Renti ], a rental management platform in New Zealand. This relationship both unlocks card acceptance and includes rich rewards for their customers who choose Mastercard. A powerful example of how we are delivering value across this ecosystem.\nMoving on to closed loop payment networks. This quarter, we deployed new contactless acceptance across closed loop transit systems in Italy, Japan, Chile and with the Chengdu and Guangzhou Metro systems in China. Altogether, we have digitized hundreds of systems across major cities around the globe. The simple tap and go experience is a great way to shift consumer behavior and we are seeing strong results. It also can be a transaction multiplier rather than buying on monthly metro card, we see a transaction for reach ride. Volumes are up too. Through the third quarter of this year, Mastercard GDV on open-loop transit systems increased 25% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Not to mention the halo effect this can drive in everyday spend categories, and that is powerful.\nWe're also driving incremental volumes from local stored value digital wallets over the Mastercard network through our partnership with Alipay+, a network of 36 e-wallets, we're now expanding cross-border payment enablement to Kakao Pay in South Korea, following earlier launches with Alipay HK and GCash. And in India, we are working with PhonePay to enable their consumers to transact in person and online using their Mastercard payment credentials. Digital wallets are increasingly partnering with Mastercard because of the value they see in our unmatched global acceptance across hundreds of millions merchant locations and digital access points.\nAgentic Commerce is here, and we're at the center of it. With our global acceptance reach, trusted brand and services capabilities, we're instrumental in creating the foundation for agentic commerce. We're now working with key players such as open AI on their agentic commerce protocol and with Google and Cloudflare to set industry standards, all to drive safety and security. To Mastercard Agent Pay, we're enabling agents to facilitate transaction over a Mastercard's payment network in a secure and scalable way. You already have agents registered and have tools in place for easy onboarding as others are ready. Our first agentic transaction took place on our network this quarter at pivotal moment in payments, and that's just the start. U.S. Bank and Citibank cardholders can now use Agent Pay. The rest of our U.S. issuers will be enabled in November with a global rollout to follow early next year.\nAnd the beauty of it all, we've made it easy for merchants across the globe to benefit on day 1 with the same trust and security they are used to do from us today. Our acceptance framework enables any Mastercard merchant to participate without significant development or integration, a no-code approach. For agentic payments, we bring trust and transparency of the right capabilities and acceptance reach. We have strong partnerships with the players I just mentioned and many more, including Walmart, to accelerate the adoption of agentic commerce using cards through Mastercard Agent Pay. And our services play a big role both today but even more so as we look to the future. Players across the payments ecosystem are partnering with Mastercard and our dedicated consulting teams to ready themselves for agentic commerce.\nAgents through Mastercard's inside tokens can make agentic commerce even more personalized. By harnessing our proprietary data, we will be able to provide agents with predictive insights to help drive smarter decisions and recommendations. The shift we're seeing in commerce is creating further opportunity for our capabilities, more consulting, more loyalty, more security and so on. The runway for agentic focus on services and consumer and business use cases is long, and we're well positioned to capture this opportunity. Like agentic commerce, we believe stable coins are an attractive and growing opportunity for our network, believe in offering consumers and merchants the choice in how they transact.\nFor years, our network has therefore enabled crypto and stable coins to be purchased and spent across our acceptance footprint. We have approximately 130 crypto co-brand card programs in market with associated volumes and transactions growing at a healthy clip. We're expanding our partnerships through new deals with consensus on the MetaMask card in the U.S. and with Binance in Brazil. We also continue to see strong growth in the on-ramp as well with quarter 3 year-to-date transactions up over 25% with spend at crypto merchants.\nMoving on to commercial and new payment flows. The B2B opportunity is massive, and we are deploying a targeted strategy to capture it. Small business remains a top priority. Over the last year, we have increased small business Mastercard in market by more than 10%. Key to our growth has been working with our traditional issuing partners such as [ Carrefour ] Financial Services in Spain but also through alternative distributors. This quarter, we partnered with [ ZAGG ], a spend management provider in India, this to credit, a small business financing platform in the U.S. In RTS, a transportation services provider in the U.S. to distribute commercial and small business cards to their customer bases. Similarly, we are working with Instacart in the U.S. to issue small business cards, offering rich rewards and instant payouts using Mastercard Move capabilities.\nOur virtual cards drive benefits across the ecosystem. Suppliers get paid faster with certainty and streamlined reconciliation via improved working capital and gain more control over spend, all in a simple and secure way. [ ABBR ] will now be issuing Mastercard virtual cards to their travel agency customers in Mexico and then our plans to expand the solution beyond to South America and Europe. We're making it easier for corporates to use virtual card capabilities within their existing workflows. Now with more than 10 global B2B and T&E platforms on board with several regional partnerships also in place. Working alongside issuers, acquirers and payment facilitators to embed card payment tools and unlock acceptance within the platforms that buyers and suppliers already use every day. And we continue to deliver value to the supplier through simplified reconciliation tools and flexible B2B economics. We have offered flexible rates in the travel space and in the U.S. for domestic business-to-business flows for years.\nLooking at the U.S. program, we have nearly doubled the number of customers participating over the last 2 years. Given its success, we are scaling flexible rate programs across the globe. Next, Mastercard Move. Our disbursement and remittances capabilities remain strong with over 35% transaction growth this past quarter. To further scale adoption, we are integrating Mastercard Move into leading core banking platforms, including Infosys this quarter, penetrating key markets in EMEA through our partnerships with Worldpay and STC Bank. And in China, we've enabled more ways for consumers to make outbound remittances across our billions of endpoints.\nIn June, we announced how we have embedded stable coins into Mastercard Move capabilities to support disbursements, remittances and B2B use cases. This spans prefunding with stable coins to sending stable coins across the globe, which can be received in any local fiat currency or support a stable coin. We continue to execute against this road map now with prefunding capabilities in place with customers in Europe, Middle East, Africa, including Pay Send this quarter.\nMoving on to our third strategic pillar, services. We have curated an expansive services portfolio featuring security, consumer engagement and business and market insights. Our services differentiate our payment network and drive meaningful value for our customers beyond the transaction itself. We're actively driving growth by further penetrating our existing customers, diversifying into new customer types, and through new innovations. Let's look at each of them.\nWe have extended our reach and share of wallet across our bank customers. We now have strategic relationships with the retail bank as well as marketing, loyalty and security offers across several of our customers. A great example is how we're building on a successful partnership with the Rogers Bank in Canada. We expanded our collaboration with the parent company, Rogers Communications to fight fraud prevention security offerings, and payment gateway solutions. They are also an initial partner to use our newly announced Mastercard merchant cloud offering, which I will touch on later. And we're expanding our customer base across merchants, governments and digital players.\nA few key examples from this quarter include the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs who will use Recorded Future threat intelligence capability. Equifax in Australia. We will be using our open finance capabilities to help inform their customers' lending practices to underserved consumers. Beyond that, we are continuously innovating to further penetrate and grow the $165 billion serviceable market we outlined at last year's Investor Day. We continue to innovate within payments. Last month, we launched on-demand decisioning, a fully customize rules engine that gives issuers greater flexibility and control of payment authorizations. This is a great example of how our network can help issuers optimize payment portfolios and strengthen their user experience in a fast, efficient way.\nFor the merchant community, we launched a merchant cloud offering, Mastercard's acceptance, gateway tokenization, fraud and insight solutions through a unified platform. Partners can now simply integrate these services into their propositions or resell directly to their customers. This is a great example of how we are delivering our innovation at scale. We're also extending our value beyond the transaction by leveraging insights from our rich and extensive data sets. By combining Mastercard's payment expertise and global network visibility with recorded future's leading cyber threat intelligence capabilities we were excited to recently announce Mastercard Threat Intelligence.\nIssuers and acquirers using Mastercard Threat Intelligence can proactively detect cyber attacks in order to prevent payment fraud. Mastercard Threat Intelligence complements our existing cybersecurity intelligence, fraud, scoring and defense functionalities. And to conclude, we recently launched Mastercard Commerce Media, a new digital media network that makes advertising more personalized, relevant and effective. Advertisers are under pressure to prove that every dollar spend drives real outcome. Mastercard Commerce Media uniquely helps advertisers see tailored offers to the right consumer at the right time by using our proprietary spend in sites. Once the offer has been served, we're able to measure the effectiveness of each ad by linking it directly to a purchase made.\nBuilding off our existing loyalty programs and technology, we're able to connect the 500 million enrolled in permission consumers and 25,000 merchant advisers -- advertisers on day 1. As you can see, we're rentlessly focused on delivering value to our customers, and that's why customers continue to choose Mastercard. So with that, I'll wrap it up. We delivered another strong quarter, a significant opportunity ahead. The fundamentals of our business are strong. I am very optimistic about the future of Mastercard. Our proven growth algorithm, differentiated solutions and continuous innovation positions us to deliver and win as we've demonstrated time and time again. It's an exciting time in payments and Mastercard is at the forefront.\nSachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Michael. Let's turn to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding replicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. .\nNet revenue was up 15%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our Value-added Services and Solutions. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 14%, including a 4 ppt increase from acquisitions. And operating income was up 15%, which includes a 1 ppt headwind from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 8% and 11%, respectively, driven primarily by the strong operating income growth, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate due to Pillar 2 and a change in our geographic mix of earnings. The tax rate in the quarter was higher than expected due to a discrete tax expense. EPS was $4.38, which includes a $0.10 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $3.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $1.2 billion through October 27, 2025.\nNow turning to Page 4. Let's first look at some of our key volume drivers for the third quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 7% and debit growth of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 10% with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 9%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 15% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.\nTurning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 10% year-over-year in Q3. We continue to see an increase in contactless penetration, which in Q3 stood at 77% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. This is up 6 ppt since the same period last year. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 3.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nTurning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the third quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 22%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to this growth. The remaining 19% increase was primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers, strong demand across security, digital and authentication solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services and business and market insights and pricing.\nNow let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 6%, while worldwide GDV grew 9%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 16%, while cross-border volumes increased 15%. The 1 ppt difference is driven by pricing in international markets, partially offset by mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 15%, while switch transactions grew 10%. On an unrounded basis, the 4 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as well as some benefit from pricing and revenue from FX volatility. Other network assessments were $255 million this quarter.\nMoving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 14%, which includes a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the growth of total adjusted operating expenses was primarily driven by increased spending to support various strategic initiatives, including investing in our infrastructure, geographic expansion, enhancing and delivering our products and services and advertising and marketing. Total adjusted operating expenses were lower than expected this quarter, primarily due to the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarter.\nTurning to Page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends. Starting with Q3, all our switch metrics are generally in line with Q2 and remained strong. As we look to the first 4 weeks of October, our metrics continue to remain strong, generally in line with the third quarter. Of note, U.S. switched volumes saw a sequential decline, primarily due to the expected Capital One debit migration as well as some tougher comps related to weather impacts in 2024. Overall, we continue to see healthy consumer and business spending.\nTurning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. The headline is that our business remains strong and consumer and business spending remains healthy. We delivered another strong quarter. The macroeconomic environment is supportive with balanced unemployment rates, wage growth continuing to outpace the rate of inflation for the most part and the wealth effect remaining intact. That said, there continues to be some ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. We remain well positioned for the opportunities ahead, driven by a resilient and diversified business model, significant opportunity for further secular shift to digital forms of payment and strong demand for our value-added services and solutions. We remain laser-focused on executing against our strategy and remaining at the forefront of payments and services as demonstrated by the innovative new solutions that Michael just highlighted. And we do all of this while also maintaining a disciplined capital planning approach.\nNow turning to our expectations for the fourth quarter. We assume continued healthy consumer and business spending. We expect year-over-year net revenue growth to be at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As mentioned last quarter, our rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments is expected to be higher in the second half of 2025. We continue to see Q4 having the highest contra percentage relative to the other quarters, primarily driven by timing within the year and normal seasonality. For the quarter, acquisitions are forecasted to add 1 to 1.5 ppt to the net revenue growth rate, and we expect a tailwind of 4 to 4.5 ppt from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 growth to be at the low double digits range versus a year ago. Again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 4 to 5 ppt to this OpEx growth while we expect an approximately 2 ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter.\nNow turning to the full year 2025. We continue to expect net revenues to grow at the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to add 1 to 1.5 ppt to this growth rate for the year, and we estimate a tailwind of 1 to 2 ppt from foreign exchange. From an operating expense standpoint, we continue to expect growth to be at the low end of a low double-digit range versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to increase the OpEx growth rate for the year by 4 to 5 ppt, while we expect a headwind of 0 to 1 ppt from foreign exchange. Other items to keep in mind on other income and expenses in Q4, we expect an expense of approximately $110 million. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be around 21% for Q4 and between 20.5% and 21% for the full year.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Julianne, you may now open up the call for questions.",

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning everyone. The headline this morning is we delivered another strong quarter with our financial results exceeding our expectations. Q2 net revenues were up 16% and adjusted net income up 12% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis. This is all underpinned by a winning strategy, diversified business model, and a relentless focus on executing against the priorities that fuel our growth algorithm. I will share several compelling examples on that today, but before I do, I will provide a few observations on the macro environment.\nConsumer spending remains healthy, supported by low unemployment and wage growth that continues to outpace inflation. This is true across both affluent as well as mass market consumers, while macro uncertainty remains due to government actions and geopolitical tensions. Overall, we remain positive about our growth outlook as the fundamentals that support consumer spending have been strong. With that as a backdrop, let's get into the details of the quarter. We continue to deliver a steady drumbeat of significant wins with leading merchants and retailers. I'm thrilled that we have extended our exclusive partnership with American Airlines, one of the world's largest credit co-brand portfolios. Our services continue to set us apart. American will leverage our advanced analytics, loyalty, personalization, and security solutions to optimize their card proposition and enhance their industry-leading travel rewards program.\nWe're also partnering with OnePay, a leading consumer fintech platform in Synchrony, to launch a new credit card with Walmart that will be available to consumers across the US and we're expanding our relationship with Uber, extending our exclusive Uber Pro card portfolios in the US and Canada. We will also launch new programs in additional markets including the UK as part of our global partnership. As you look around the world, it's clear that leading merchants see tremendous value in partnering with Mastercard.\nWe're also winning with fintechs, Buy Now, Pay Later providers, and marketplaces with PayPal. We extended our card issuing partnership in the United States. We also signed new credit and debit issuing agreements in the UK and Germany. We are excited for PayPal's recently launched contactless mobile wallet in Germany. I just love doing things in Germany. In the Buy Now, Pay Later space, we signed an exclusive prepaid and credit card issuing deal with Afterpay in Australia. In Argentina, we renewed our consumer prepaid deal with e-commerce and fintech platform Mercado Libre. We're also partnering with them to launch new credit card programs in that market. We renewed our partnership with Sicoob, one of the largest credit unions in Brazil. Across credit, debit, and commercial.\nIn addition to winning deals, we're capitalizing on the significant volume and transaction opportunity in consumer payments by expanding acceptance, transforming the checkout experience, opening new verticals, leveraging alternative distribution channels, and launching innovative new capabilities. I'll give you a few examples for each of these five dimensions, starting with acceptance. We continue to leverage our contactless technology to drive open loop acceptance in the transit space. Our momentum here continues. In Q2, over 60 new public transport operators hopped on board to accept cards from Ventura County, California to Taichung Metro in Taiwan. We're also opening transit acceptance in China. This quarter we launched Tap to Pay in the Shanghai Metro, which followed a successful launch in the Beijing Metro last year. In a QR-based ecosystem, this represents an important evolution toward a multi-form-factor market that includes NFC technology.\nWe're also transforming the online checkout experience by driving adoption of capabilities like tokenization, Click to Pay, and payment passkeys. We have significant momentum towards our 2030 vision to transform online checkout into a single click experience. In Europe, over 50% of e-commerce transactions are now tokenized, and for Click to Pay, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac are automatically enrolling cardholders over the coming months, bringing mass market adoption in Australia. Issuers around the world are committed to removing manual entry by also making Click to Pay a core card benefit, including NatWest, Standard Bank, Bank Vostok in Ukraine, and others. On the acceptance side, the number of Click to Pay transacting merchants was up 4x in the first half of 2025 versus a year ago.\nWe're also focused on driving acceptance in new verticals that have not historically been well penetrated by cards. Insurance payments are a great example. Significant flows, strong consumer demand in a vertical that has undergone a digital transformation in recent years. However, card penetration is far lower relative to other carded categories. We are attacking this opportunity through new agreements with partners like Adyen, Checkout.com, Stripe, Transcard, and Worldpay. These partners will focus on enabling consumers to pay their insurance premiums. They will support claims disbursements to policyholders, and they will facilitate B2B payments from insurers to vendors providing services for these clients.\nNext, we're tapping into alternative distribution channels. For example, we're enabling stored value wallets around the globe. Our partnership with Alipay in Hong Kong and GCash will enable 36 local e-wallets to extend their use for cross-border through the International Alipay wallet gateway. A Mastercard credential is automatically added to the wallets, allowing any stored value to be spent via a simple tap anywhere Mastercard is accepted around the globe. This is again a huge vote of confidence for NFC. Let's look at other areas where we're creating and deploying smart and engaging consumer experience that drive brand preference and incremental spend. First up, we're providing offerings that meet the unique needs of each individual cardholder. In Canada, we partner with CIBC to launch the CIBC Adapta Mastercard, which automatically applies additional rewards against your top three spending categories each month.\nIt also includes our innovative Touch Card functionality which allows cardholders, including the visually impaired, to easily distinguish the card from others in their wallet. Next, affluent cardholders. On average, they spend over two times more per card and up to three times more on cross-border. We're elevating our affluent value proposition with the Mastercard Collection, a comprehensive set of premium benefits created to drive top-of-wallet behavior. That's paired with the expansion of a World product suite in the newly created World Legend Mastercard, our most prestigious consumer card, which is now available to banks globally. This first launch this month with the Citi Strata Elite card. Finally, we're providing greater flexibility for consumers.\nWe've deployed the Mastercard One Credential as a network-level capability worldwide, enables issuers to offer a single digitally connected credential to give consumers flexibility as to how they want to pay debit, credit, prepaid installments, or stablecoin all through their banking app.\nAs Raj and Joran explained in detail in our recent call on agentic commerce and stablecoins, we're leaning in to open up and drive new opportunities for our network in these spaces. If you didn't have a chance to join, I encourage you to listen to the replay. Today, I reinforce a few key points. First, agentic commerce, we see this as an exciting opportunity across consumer and commercial flows to shop with merchants easily and securely. We are scaling AgentPay globally, leveraging our capabilities to extend the trust of the Mastercard brand. It enables us to support a new way for consumers to transact. It gives us yet another capability. It sets us apart from domestic and alternative payments systems, and it provides a way for us to drive switching and sell more services.\nAs for stablecoins, we see it as another currency. We also see it as additive to the network with opportunities for us to provide the on and off ramps from fiat to stablecoin, to partner with device and wallets to bring interoperability, bring relevant services, bring global reach, and trust to the specific use cases.\nWith new technologies we always embrace innovation. We offer choice and extended network to new partners and we're doing the same thing here. We will bring our reach, ubiquity, and trust to Agentic Commerce and stablecoins and will provide an environment for our partners to innovate upon. That is the Mastercard way.\nNow turning to commercial payments, we're driving growth by launching differentiated capabilities, scaling our industry-leading virtual card solutions, and expanding small business card distribution through new and expanded partnerships. In terms of new capabilities, the Small Business Navigator provides US entrepreneurs access to cybersecurity solutions, insights and analytics, and partner tools to support more efficient and effective operations. Through the platform, Fiserv's Clover is partnering with us to offer SMEs discounted point-of-sale capabilities, and Square is providing tailored educational programs to help small businesses thrive. In the fleet space, several leading US issuers, including Corpay, are deploying our new capability to integrate fleet cards into digital wallets. For the first time, fleet managers can now instantly issue and manage digital cards, while drivers will be prompted to provide key data like odometer readings when they tap to pay at the pump.\nWhen it comes to invoice payments, we continue to scale our proprietary virtual card technology by making it easier for issuers and technology platforms to integrate our capabilities. We are now live with eight leading B2B platforms including Coupa, Cvent, GEP, HRS, Navan, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, and SAP Taulia, several more in implementation. On the supplier side, our Receivables Manager platform is now available globally. It's being deployed through partners like Elavon, Run Payments, and Easy Pay to streamline virtual card acceptance and payment reconciliation.\nWe're also driving small business and card distribution through a series of new and expanded issuer and marketplace partnerships. We've enhanced our exclusive relationship with Payoneer through a suite of services designed to accelerate growth of their small business customers. Across Europe, we are partnering with e-commerce marketplaces like Box Commerce who will distribute prepaid business cards to their merchants so that they can make and receive payments on cards across several countries in Africa.\nShifting to disbursement, we continue to see strong growth in our Mastercard Move capabilities with year-over-year transaction growth of over 35% in Q2. We're focused on penetrating a wide range of new and existing use cases. For example, in the disbursement space, we've partnered with Jack Henry to distribute Mastercard Move to thousands of community banks through their Rapid! Transfer solution. We've expanded our relationship with Nuvei, who will leverage Mastercard Move to enable Canadian businesses to facilitate near-instant payouts to Mastercard debit and prepaid cards. Staying in Canada, BMO Canada is expanding the use of our cross-border services in about 20 additional corridors.\nMoving to our third strategic pillar, value-added services and solutions. We continue to leverage the power of our data and product capabilities to differentiate payments and capture adjacent revenue opportunities. We do this by penetrating existing customers, diversifying into new customer types, targeting new buying centers, leveraging B2B partners for distribution, and deploying new services. Our years of experience and full suite of products helps us build fit-for-purpose solutions for clients. We're seeing this in practice with several large customers. For example, we've partnered with Garanti BBVA to support multiple strategic initiatives including revamping their digital wallet, optimizing collections, and boosting credit card sales across digital channels. We've partnered with Deutsche Bank to use our open banking capabilities to grow account-to-account payments across Europe.\nThese services deliver significant value in their own right, but they are even more powerful because of the linkage to payments that fuels our virtuous cycle.\nWe also continue to capture payment adjacent opportunities and win business with customers beyond issuers and acquirers. We're leveraging our test and learn capabilities with partners as diverse as Lufthansa and ad tech company Blis to help them conduct scalable, sophisticated testing in areas such as media measurement, operations, and marketing. Our range of capabilities also enables us to expand into new buying centers with existing customers. For example, the credit risk team at Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil, plans to leverage our small business credit analytics product to enhance the accuracy of its credit offerings to SME clients. We're also leveraging B2B channel partners to distribute our services at scale. Solidgate, a payment processing platform in EMEA used by merchants over 150 countries, will use identity insights for transactions to help reduce fraud and increase acceptance. Finally, we continue to develop new services.\nWe just announced Mastercard Account to Account Protect, which will combine our cutting edge fraud prevention technology with a new dispute resolution framework to safeguard consumers when making account to account payments. Deploying services like this across account to account rails is a major step forward as it helps us grow our addressable market while also further protecting our customers and the ecosystem. We're starting with customers in the UK including NatWest, Santander, and Monzo to bring this to global account account overlay to other markets later this year.\nWe remain enthusiastic about our future growth potential for services. Our breadth of data, network of partners, unique product capabilities, strong customer relationships, and our incredible talent will help us to continue to differentiate and provide us with substantial runway for growth. So with that, that was a lot.\nI will wrap it up.\nIn summary, we delivered another very strong quarter. Despite an uncertain backdrop, there is significant opportunity ahead. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Our proven growth algorithm and differentiated solutions position us to deliver and win as we have demonstrated time and time again. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for Q2 on a currency neutral basis excluding, where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 16%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. This growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by higher than expected revenue from FX volatility. Operating expenses increased 14%, including a full ppt increase from acquisitions, and operating income was up 17%, which includes a 1 ppt headwind from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 12% and 14% respectively, driven primarily by the strong operating income growth partially offset by a higher effective tax rate due to the impact of the Global Minimum Tax rules, which came into effect at the start of this year.\nEPS was $4.15 which includes a $0.09 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $1 billion through 28 July 2025.\nNow turning to page 4, let's first look at some of our key volume drivers for the Q2 on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 9% year over year. In the US GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 7%. This growth was impacted by the lapping of the Citizens debit portfolio migration to Mastercard which commenced in Q1 2024. Outside of the US volume increased 10% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 11%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 15% globally for the quarter reflecting continued growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending.\nTurning to page 5, switched transactions grew 10% year over year. In Q2, both card present and card not present growth rates remained strong. Card present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration as contactless now represents 75% of all in person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 6% globally; there are 3.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Turning now to slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the Q2 discussed on a currency neutral basis, Payment Network net revenue increased 13% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates, incentives, value-added services, and solutions. Net revenue increased 22%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to this growth. The remaining growth was primarily driven by demand for our consumer acquisition and engagement services.\nGrowth in our underlying drivers, the scaling of our security and digital and authentication solutions, and pricing.\nNow let's turn to page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 9% while worldwide GDV grew 9%. Cross-border assessments increased 15% with cross-border volumes also increasing 15%. Pricing in international markets was primarily offset by mix as lower yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than higher yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing assessments were up 18% while switched transactions grew 10%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily due to revenue related to FX volatility and favorable mix. Other network assessments were $260 million this quarter.\nMoving on to page 8, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 14%, which includes a 4 percentage point impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the growth of total adjusted operating expenses was primarily driven by increased spending to support various strategic initiatives including hardening of our technology infrastructure, diversifying our geographic footprint to further capture the secular trend, enhancing our products, and delivering our services.\nTurning to page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends. Overall, we continue to see healthy consumer and business spending, and metrics were generally in line with our expectations. Starting with Q2, I will discuss the operating metrics on a sequential basis adjusting for the leap year and the timing of Easter and other holidays. Switched volume growth was impacted by a number of smaller factors including tougher comps primarily due to the lapping of portfolios won in 2024, the timing of Social Security payments, and the mix of calendar days, and lower gas prices. Switched transaction growth remained relatively stable as it relates to cross-border; underlying growth remains strong. Let's double-click on cross-border travel growth.\nAs mentioned in our last earnings call, we saw some moderation in select Middle East and Africa markets primarily due to tougher comps, enforcement of Mastercard rules, and a ratcheting up of geopolitical conflict. Late in the quarter, we also saw some lapping of portfolios in 2024. Cross-border card-not-present ex-travel growth remained strong. Now looking at the first four weeks of July, switch volume, switch transaction, and cross-border card-not-present ex-travel growth remained stable. For cross-border travel growth, the sequential decrease is primarily driven by the timing of Easter as well as the continuation of the impacts I mentioned earlier. With all of that being said, our overall cross-border volumes continue to grow well in the mid-teens range. This is supported by strong underlying consumer spending and a diversified portfolio across geographies and travel and non-travel spend.\nTurning now to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. The headline is that our business remains strong and consumer spending remains healthy. The macroeconomic environment has been supportive with low unemployment rates and, for the most part, wage growth continuing to outpace the rate of inflation. That said, ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty remains. With global policy shifts ongoing, we remain agile, monitoring developments, and we stand ready to adjust as needed in this period of heightened uncertainty. What remains clear is that we have a well-diversified business across geographies, products, and services, and discretionary and non-discretionary spend categories, and we remain laser focused on the execution of our strategy, as Michael said, while maintaining a disciplined capital planning approach.\nNow turning to our expectations for the full year 2025, our base case for the remainder of the year assumes continued healthy consumer and business spending. Given the strong first half results, we are tightening the full year net revenue outlook range to the high end of the range we shared with you at the time of our Q1 earnings. We now expect net revenues to grow at the low teens range on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to add 1 to 1.5 ppt to this growth for the year, while we now estimate a tailwind of 1 to 2 ppt from foreign exchange. From an operating expense standpoint, we continue to expect growth to be at the low end of a low double digits range versus a year ago on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to increase the OpEx growth rate for the year by 4 to 5 ppt, while we expect a headwind of 0 to 1 ppt from foreign exchange. Now turning to Q3 year over year, net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a low double digits range on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to add one to 1.5 ppt to this growth rate and we expect a tailwind of 1 to 2 ppt from foreign exchange for the quarter.\nFrom an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 growth to be at the low end of a low double digits range versus a year ago, again on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add approximately 5 ppt to this OpEx growth, while we expect a headwind of 0 to 1 ppt from foreign exchange for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind on other income and expenses in Q3, we expect an expense of approximately $130 million given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 20 to 21% range for both Q3 and the full year based on the current geographic mix of our business.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Julianne, you may now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please only press Star one once to queue up for a question as pressing Star one multiple times may affect your position in the queue. Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning, Sachin. You mentioned the lapping of portfolios, obviously Citizens in the Q1.\nI guess like as we move through.\nQ2, was there a more prominent impact?\nI guess as we look toward the back part of this year, are.\nThere further lapping of other deals?\nThen just on Capital One and.\nDiscover, I know they kind of talked about the transition happening next year now, so I assume like is that just.\nNot in your numbers for the remainder.\nOf this year, in terms of a migration of the debit portfolio.\nThanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks Sanjay. So let me take both your questions there. So as it relates to lapping, just a quick reminder, it's more than just the Citizens portfolio, right? I mean we won the Citizens portfolio last year, we won the Wells Fargo small business credit portfolio last year, and these are the two big ones in the US but there were several other wins which we had across the globe as well. But specifically to your question as it relates to the impact of lapping toward the year over year growth metrics, just as a reminder, the Wells Fargo portfolio converted in Q2 of last year. The Citizens portfolio started conversion in Q1 and then ramped up in Q2 of last year. So what you should expect is that the lapping impact has gotten more pronounced in Q2 and then will continue through in Q3 and Q4.\nSo there is going to be continued lapping not only on account of those portfolios but other portfolios as well. So that's kind of to your first question. On your second question on Capital One, look, I mean at the end of the day, as I mentioned in prior earnings calls, we've taken our best estimate into consideration as it relates to the migration of the debit portfolio with Capital One. And we continue to our current guidance to you still assumes our best estimates around that, obviously the transaction is now complete. Conversions have actually started. They're still ramping up. So it still takes some time before the conversions actually come into play. I also want to just remind you sequentially how this works. Right.\nThe new cards are issued, the new cards go into the hands of consumers at the same time, and the old cards are still there. The Mastercard branded cards are still alive and well. We take our best estimates as to how volumes will roll off. Overall, I would tell you we expect that the ramp up in terms of the volume declines will increase as the year progresses. We expect this year the net revenue impact to be minimal to our overall company's net revenues. Vast majority of the impact we expect to feel will be next year.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAt the same time, we continue to expect a strong partnership on the credit side and the services side. It's not only about rolling off, it's also about continuing to build our business with Capital One.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys. Thanks. You know, when we look at some of these wins, I just want to dive in a little deeper onto the value added services that you're calling out as the most differentiating. Obviously your competitors also call out value added services. So when considering what you think stands out and then sort of as an add on to that, the pricing dynamic, we've seen really good pricing for value that you've shown in your numbers now and seems to be somewhat. I think it would affect a lot of them in July and October last year. Just touch on the areas you're finding the most pricing power and if we can expect more of the same over the next 12 months.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right, so let me kick this off with an answer on the first part here on the VAS portfolio. So when I look across the portfolio, I think the first thing to say. It's a very carefully curated portfolio. This isn't a set of single pearls on a string. So this is really before, during, after transaction, how we can bring value around the payment transaction, and then even beyond that when you think about topics like cybersecurity. So carefully curated. First point to know.\nWhen you think about it over the arc of time, we have been particularly focused over the past decade or so on security solutions. So that's certainly a standout from a differentiation perspective. We've also been incredibly focused on leveraging our data to drive better engagement solutions for our customers. So if you think in a more digital world your cyber risks will go up, that's why cyber security is at the focus of what we're doing. And in a more digital world, consumer engagement gets harder and harder, and you need better technology, better differentiation to drive through the clutter. So if I take some specifics out of both of these portfolios, first of all, on the cybersecurity side.\nThe stakes are getting higher and higher. The fraudsters are using latest technology, using artificial intelligence, generative AI to power their solutions to break through on the fraud side. On the cybersecurity side, we're doing exactly the same. I mentioned this in previous calls. Decision Intelligence Pro is leveraging data out of all sources of the internet, putting it through a generative AI engine for us, predicting frauds. Instead of preventing fraud, we're going to predicting fraud, which is the latest stage of this kind of game. And this is clear, identifiable value for our customers that are very happy to pay for. And here we are right at the second point of your question on pricing and for value. On the customer engagement side, it's very similar. Our personalization engine, through our Dynamic Yield acquisition, continues to be providing outstanding value to our customers.\nTo really drive that personalized solution, let's say you're a retail bank and you want to drive new account growth. You need a personalized solution, right channel, right context to do that. That's what personalization, what personalization through Dynamic Yield does for us and for our customers in a way, better than anybody else out there. You find us in the top quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant. What is that called? Quadrant thing, whatever, the top quadrant. So they are really good at that. So a couple of examples. So in the world with some uncertainty, uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, the desire for our customers to make sure they got full focus on the fraud line in their P&L to drive their top line with better acquisitions, that allows us to.\nTo say, here is an outcome that you can see that you will see in your P&L. That gives us power to price for that because we're pricing for that exact value. That's what I would say. It's a very differentiated proposition across the industry. We've been at it for a decade, and we're going to continue to push that forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question. Next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Good morning, Michael. I want to ask about commercial POS, which you've sized as a $16 trillion opportunity and cards only having about less than 10% market share. You have a very good business in the US, and I know you talked about this in your prepared remarks for a little bit, but maybe expand upon how you're taking this business international and the momentum you may be seeing there. Seems like this is quite a kind of medium term to near term opportunity for you. Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. You know, I couldn't agree more, Harshita. Medium, you know, short- to medium-term opportunity very much out there in the commercial POS space. There's still so much cash out there. There's so many checks out there, and there's been so many almost virgin markets where issuers, you know, where companies just haven't focused on this. So that is not new news. This is why we put out the market sizing as we did at our investor day. So this is significant. The way to go to market on that is really to build those issuer relationships. We have the product construct today. It's not about building new products in this space. We have that. It's really finding the partners out there, finding the marketplaces that focus on small business to drive that business. We take another lens at this. It's not just about small business.\nI mentioned my comments in my comments earlier. There is the fleet card business which we're the leader in this business. That's again it's a leading product and we're differentiating on that. We're pushing that around the world as well as other, you know, in other regions. This starts to come in focus. So the whole wave of digitization, the pressure on profitability, the rebalancing of supply chains, companies are looking for solutions that make running their business easier. And this is where this comes in. For example, it's very much about being paid faster as a small business. That's what cards does for them and that is a very helpful thing. So overall it's a pretty clear go to market. It's not rocket science but we are differentiated on some of our solutions, fleet card and so forth. And we've been at it at a long time.\nWe have now staffed this all up around the world with SME-focused specialized teams and product teams around the world. We're taking this very seriously, which is why we put out our very ambitious growth targets to penetrate that SAM that we shared at the Investor Day with you.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Nice results here. Just on the upside in the quarter on revenue, it sounds like it came from FX volatility and strength in in value added services. Just wanted to confirm that and understand what's performing better than expected given pretty steady spend trends, and then quickly for Michael, if you don't mind, just are you any update on performance of Recorded Future? Any surprises there half a year in.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks, Tien-Tsin. I'll take the first part of your question. You nailed it. The upside in Q2 was primarily driven by FX volatility. We had solid performance across the business. I don't want to make this only about FX volatility right at the end of the day, right? Our payment network net revenues just performed. Our drivers continue to reflect the strong consumer and business spending taking place. Our value-added services and solutions continue to perform. So all of that kind of is the bedrock which allows for the strong performance overall. But the delta which you're talking about in terms of potential upside came through primarily from higher FX volatility. Now I will say on FX volatility that was in the early part of the quarter, that was mostly in April, a little bit in May.\nIn terms of the higher levels, it has come back to what would be the historical levels of FX volatility. Goldman knows where that's going to go for the rest of the year, but that's really what's driving that.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOn Recorded Future, you know, if I can just remind everybody. Thank you for the question, Tien-Tsin. So world's largest threat intelligence company, 1,900 customers, 75 countries. So very significant. You see a lot of, you know, Fortune 100 companies in there as well as G20 governments. So it's an excellent mix. Based out of Boston. We love them.\nPre our acquisition we already started. We had a partnership with them on a couple of products. We launched a few things there. Now we are in post acquisition stage so we've hit the ground running. It is still very early days obviously, but we're already putting out more products with them. Malware intelligence is one that I called out in the last quarter around this. The beauty here is they have a lot of data which they get from all sources of the Internet. As I mentioned earlier. At the same time we have a lot of data. The combination of that is the magic sauce here. The effectiveness of us to help our customers predict to understand targeted threats. You know, if you are a company and you're trying to defend against cybersecurity and you're doing this in a very broad fashion that is very expensive.\nWhat Recorded Future, what Mastercard is now helping our customer with is identifying where the threat vectors actually are so you can be much more targeted in your response. That is first of all more effective from reducing cybersecurity risk, at the same time it's more effective from a cost perspective. So that's a really winning proposition. We're excited about that. The teams are putting these, you know, are very busy on the product side to put this out. At the same time there's obvious synergies of Mastercard's reach with our clients to take these differentiated products and take them to the market. At the same time we have a whole set of security solutions that we can sell and we want to sell and we will sell into the 1,900 customers and the new customers that they will gain.\nThis is a very natural extension of our multi-layered security solution strategy to go into threat intelligence, which is now the state of the art.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you. On cross-border volumes, Sachin, I heard the call outs on the Middle East and the portfolio lappings, but outside of Q4 last year, cross-border has been consistently slowing. You're at 12% ex Central Europe growth in July. With the mix you have today between travel and e-commerce. I'm just curious what you guys view is the right normal level of growth for each of those two buckets and then for the overall. So I'm just trying to get at kind of if we assume a stable macro what you guys think the floor should be for cross-border volume growth. Thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, Trevor. So look, I mean we do not put out long-term guidance as it relates to cross-border. But what I will share with you is the following, which is let's just step back and think about our cross-border portfolio and think about the fact that it is not concentrated to any single corridor. Last earnings call, I kind of shared with all of you that there is no single cross-border corridor pair which represents represented greater than 3% of cross-border volume in 2024. So there is a high degree of diversification which we've got. So we're not necessarily susceptible to big swings in any one jurisdiction. But it's important to note that this diversification is by design as opposed to happenstance, point number 1.\nNumber 2, the base proposition of cross-border is something which is very valued by consumers even today and consumers as well as businesses. And so that continues to grow pretty well. Number 3, there's great diversification which is there between travel and non-travel. And you can see that because at the end of the day by having that diversification you're still seeing pretty good overall cross-border volume growth notwithstanding the fact that travel has actually been impacted a little bit by the factors which I kind of talked about. And just as a few data points for you, our cross-border travel volumes represent roughly 60% of total cross-border volumes.\nOur cross-border non-travel, what we call cross-border card not present ex travel, is about 40%. So it's pretty good and well diversified.\nYou can see the Card Not Present ex travel cross-border is growing at roughly about 20% there. So my overall kind of message to you is high level of diversification, strong value prop, and the business continues to perform well. You know what the reality is? I can't really tell you as to where this is, but it has been growing at a rate faster than our overall growth rates for GDV. You've seen that come through. That's really where I feel like we are best positioned to continue to capitalize. Our company remains very focused not only to win the right portfolios, but to drive the best optimization of our existing portfolios. That's what we'll continue to do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey guys. Thank you. Maybe on client incentives, one thing we just noticed: for many years, client incentives grew faster than revenue. But the last three quarters, they've actually been growing the same or even a.\nLittle slower in some cases. I'm wondering, is this a new trend.\nHow should we think about this and what's happening?\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. So, Dave, here's what I'd say. I would say that as part of our last call, I had mentioned that we expected the cadence of our rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments to start to pick up in the second half of the year. And so if I would tell you sequentially, I would tell you that in Q3, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be sequentially higher compared to Q2. The point really is the market is still a very competitive market. We continue to be very active in that market. We have a very strong pipeline of deals.\nNothing has changed as far as I'm concerned in terms of how we're approaching the market and what we're doing in terms of trying to win the right portfolios.\nI'll emphasize, this is not about winning every portfolio. This is about winning the right portfolios. A little bit of what you're also seeing in the contra ratio, the rebates and incentives ratio we're talking about in Q2 is being driven by the fact that the denominator, which is our payment network assessments, has been impacted or has been helped by higher FX volatility levels. So when you take those ratios into consideration, you got to factor that in as you think about what this looks like on a going forward basis.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys, good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to ask about some of the consumer data fees that some of the large banks are talking about applying. I guess specifically, how are you thinking about the impact of those fees on Finicity? Then, big picture, as a consumer who relies on a lot of these services that use Finicity and other vendors to aggregate the data, how am I and other consumers better off from the banks kind of charging you and other data providers for access to their data? Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThis is a great question. Important topic. You've heard us talk about open finance for years.\nEven before the acquisition of Finicity, this whole idea that a consumer can use their data footprint to veil better services in the finance space, and you go from open finance to open data in any other space, I think it's a good notion and that generally resonates and will not go away. You see this in Europe, where we're very active in the open banking, open finance space, using in Australia and here in the US. This more recent conversation, I mean, we've all seen.\nThe coverage on this.\nWe don't really have full visibility here on what is being specifically considered by a number of banks. I can tell you Chase and other banks are fantastic partners of ours. That's for sure true. We'll have to see where this goes. Our fundamental belief that consumer consented data and their ability to share that is very important, and that will be a winning proposition over time. Various economic considerations out there that are being discussed in the coverage will have to be figured out. It's not something that we have been engaged in at this point. We'll see. We have to work it through, fundamentally an important space, and you should be able to do exactly what you just said. Will.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Appreciate you taking the question, Michael.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rayna Kumar from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRayna Kumar\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just based off of some of my recent channel checks, it looks like Pix in Brazil is being used by almost everyone there. Can you give us an update on your progress in gaining market share in regions that have strong A to A players like Pix in Brazil and UPI in India? What strategies and products are you employing to capture the cash transition in these countries? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard",
    "content2": "Right, Rayna, great question and certainly a topic that we have been focused on. I give you some examples in a prepared mark, what sets us apart in winning against domestic schemes and so forth. We continue to try to differentiate our product set. You asked specifically about Brazil and countries like that, maybe that is a good opportunity to just illustrate what I just said a little more in the context of Brazil. Here is a system that has been put out very much with one focus in mind, which was to address some financial inclusion aspects and has been very successful at that. At the same time, we have strong partnerships in the Brazilian markets, with banks, with fintechs across the board, and we've been driving our business to put better solutions into the hands of consumers.\nThat is always a focus on all consumers. Consumers that graduate into the digital, Brazilian digital economy through Pix, you know, you could see them over time graduating into our products that we provide on the card side, etc. What we've also been doing is you have to be very laser focused on how you compete. One thing that we just as an industry, as a company, wanted to do a better job on is make sure that we have the latest state-of-the-art solution for online transactions in the market. The debit platform in Brazil, we have completely revamped and put out a new set of solutions out there that now Pix is also enabling consumers with their solutions.\nWe wanted to make sure that we have a competitive product, which we now have in the hands of the banks in Brazil. That continues. Pix is innovating on various other things, buy now, pay later, and so forth, and so are we. There's an excellent solution out there in the market already on installment payments, so that is very competitive, as far as we can tell. There are recurring payment solutions that Pix is considering, and that's great. We're seeing the benefit in that, and we have for a long time. There's a very strong proposition, particularly on credit cards that are on file in the market, which allows us to win and continue to drive this business.\nThe business continues to see very healthy growth rates for us in Brazil, you know, from that perspective, I think it's just, you know, our general approach: provide choice, partner wherever we can, compete effectively in the market. That's the game. It's a similar game in India on UPI. We always look to partner wherever we can and otherwise have a good solution out there for our partners. I see tremendous opportunity in the overall growth. This is a very effective digital economy in Brazil that continues to grow at strong rates, and we're a big player there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Craig Maurer from. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Question, quick one. On Pillar 2, you know, the administration's been talking about reaching deals with certain countries to eliminate the Pillar 2 issues for US companies. Any thoughts on that would be helpful. You know, if we can go back to your digital identity and Auth solutions, you know, it's our view that financial services, due to the high regulatory requirements in the space, will be leaders in in this category. Can you talk about what segments you're seeing the most growth or most demand from? You know, we hear a lot about crypto companies requiring digital Auth solutions and others. Digital identity solutions. If you can comment a little there, that would be great.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah.\nCraig, why don't I take your question on Pillar 2 first? I mean, we've seen the same news you're seeing as it relates to some dialogue around potentially having an exception for US-based multinationals from the impact of Pillar 2. The reality is there's a lot of work still to be done between where we are today to that being realized. Let me just spend two minutes on this. At the end of the day, the way it works is if there are going to be any changes in terms of having any exceptions for US-based companies from 2 Two, that's got to happen not only in the nature of the OECD countries agreeing upon it, but every individual country which has enacted legislation already to implement Pillar 2 has to now reverse the impact of that legislation.\nThis is really, really important because the reality is there's work between when the announcement's made, when there's clarity given as to how it's going to be implemented, to the actual implementation of that. I guess the best way to describe this is there's been local legislation, let's say passed in Singapore, which would say that we as a company now pay a 15% tax rate in Singapore. Right. Earlier we had an incentivized tax rate out there. We now pay starting 2025 a 15% tax rate there. There has to be a change in legislation locally to take place to reflect what you just alluded to in the nature of this exception for US multinational countries. That being said, it's not only about Singapore, it's also about other countries.\nWho have actually put in this legislation, who have to change it because there was a component of Pillar 2, which is called UTPR, which basically entitled other countries in the chain to collect taxes to the extent that they were not topped up to 15% as a result of a particular jurisdiction. For example, if Singapore changes legislation and took the tax rate down again, that doesn't mean we'll get the benefit of the lower tax rate. It's because all the other countries are now entitled to true up the gap between what Singapore's rate is and the 15% rate is. All of those countries have to reverse that legislation before we start to see the impact of that come through. Complicated topic. Happy to talk in more detail if you'd like afterwards.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nGood. On ID, if you think about a tech stack and, you know, elements of the tech stack for the digital economy, we look at this and say we're powering the digital economy, we're powering digital commerce. Digital identity is a fundamental element of what needs to happen in that kind of world. Who's behind the transaction? Who is at the other end of the transaction? That is not just about payments. Exactly to your question, this is about onboarding on anything. You could be, it could be a merchant onboarding a consumer. Today, this thing, I'm going to send you an email and you confirm that, that is not identifying your consumer. All things can go wrong on that. Digital identity, proper digital identity, is really critical now. The game of digital identity is getting harder and harder with technology.\nI was talking earlier about cybersecurity risk and so forth. The stakes are increasing and you got to get better at it. The good thing is we've been at this for a long time and this is initially around Mastercard payments and transactions, but we have very specific examples out there. For example, you heard us talk about in the open banking space, are we taking a digital identity solution, coupling that with open banking connectivity to make it clear that data can actually be exchanged in a very safe fashion? I gave you one of my favorite use cases in this and this is MLB, Major League Baseball. If you want to vote for the All Star Game, what is happening is that our identity solution is behind it, this is actually you voting and not your brother, your cousin, and so forth.\nThere's a whole wide range of use cases that go way away from our core business into a whole new set of new cases. It's really an enabler of the overall digital economy. You see if you draw concentric circles around the transaction, the payment transaction being in the center, we try to play further and further out to be truly powering the digital economy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nate Svensson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNate Svensson\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the US consumer here. On the month-to-date trends, the step up in volume growth in the US stood out to us, relatively stable versus Q2, but a step up from 4% in June to 8% in July. I was hoping you could dig a little more into the trends you're seeing. There could be a day's mix thing, online promotional activity, but wondering if there's anything else under the hood you're seeing that might explain the acceleration. I know you called out stability in mass market versus affluent consumers, but any verticals or areas of spend where trends have evolved here.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nOkay, sure, Nate.\nWhen I take your question.\nThe impact on that 4% you're seeing in June is being driven by the mix of calendar days as well as the timing of Social Security payments, which is something just between which actually varies between June and July. That being said, I will say what we're seeing.\nIn the first four weeks of July is strength in the US consumer. I mean, there's no hiding from that.\nRight.\nThe reality is, and again, four weeks don't make the quarter. That's, I mean, that's one thing which, you know, we've just got to keep an eye on. Right now, if I strip out the impact of this timing stuff, there's still underlying trends in the US consumer that we're seeing come through. I think you want to keep that in mind, and we'll track it closely. We do our best estimates in terms of the guide we provided you to capture what we're seeing in the nature of the latest trends. That's what I would say as it relates to the US consumer. On your second question on mass versus affluent, look, overall, what we're seeing is good spending across both mass and affluent. I mean, really, at the end of the day, we're not seeing.\nI will be the first to preface that the data we have is our derived data. It's based on our product categories and our product codes. Right. That's how we figure out what we think is mass and what is affluent. We obviously are not directly in touch with the consumer. That's our customers who are in touch with the consumer. Based on the data that we see, we're seeing pretty steady trends across both mass and affluent.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nI'll just add a point, a tangential point here is these kind of questions we get all the time from our customers, from governments around the world, and we've built a really nice engagement practice through our Advisors business and throughout the Mastercard Economics Institute to really address these prevalent, top-of-mind questions. What's the consumer doing here? What is this sector doing there? It's been a really particularly important differentiator for us as we engage at the highest level on a strategic dialogue with customers, governments, etc.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Fahed Kunwar from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFahed Kunwar\n\nEquity Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi, both, and thanks for the color on the call. I had a question on pricing, actually, first, specifically on that. I know you called out deepening customer penetration, and you called out securities and customer engagement, but how much has pricing been a factor in this quarter versus kind of that deepening share of wallet, and how much more to go is there for pricing going forward? I guess if I widen that question a little bit, rethink about pricing in your other businesses, CMS or your consumer payments business, do you still see pricing potential as you head into 2026, or is it remaining, or does it stay quite competitive? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nSure, Fahed.\nI mean, at the end of the day, the way I would actually answer your question is the following. We will have the ability to price for the value we deliver. So long as we continue to deliver the value we're delivering, we'll have the ability to price, and that's what we've done historically, and that's what we'll do on a going forward basis. I would say that again, I don't necessarily think about this on a quarter over quarter basis. I think about this as what is the long-term trajectory of our product proposition rollouts, and what's the ability for us to price. Sometimes you roll out products earlier, you might actually layer in the pricing at a later point in time. Other instances, you roll out the product and you'll put in the requisite pricing at the same point in time.\nAll of this is all very strongly tied back to what is the value we're delivering. To your question about whether we see the potential on a going forward basis, the answer is yeah, so long as we continue to do our jobs, which is to continue to deliver value in the market.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThanks Julian.\nI think we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to follow up on that pricing question. I mean, you took some price, I think, in various parts of the business. I think it was started in Q3 2024, you know, particularly around, you know, tokenization. I think some of the other lines, you know, should we expect to start lapping some of those pricing initiatives in the second half? Maybe you can just remind us how you're thinking about that. Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, can I would tell you first.\nOf all, you know, when you say we took price, we like to think about the fact that we delivered value in the Q3 of last year, which allowed us to actually price for the value we delivered. To your question around lapping, I would say, yeah, sure. I mean you would see the lapping effect of that particular value delivery which took place for which we priced happened in the second half of this year. Again, think about this in the nature of what is the cadence of value we can continue to provide, which will help us to actually.\nBring in more value and more price for us to be able to actually continue to grow ourselves. The reality is, look, you've got to think about this in the context of when companies put out new products, when companies put out differentiated products, they have the ability to charge for the value deliver. I'd say that's what we've continued to do on a going forward basis as well.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. You know, this is very true. It's not about taking price, but providing value. I think the key aspect is who we provide value to. We provide value to our existing customers. When we talk about our go to market and services, when we talk our go to market for a whole set of payment solutions, it's about new customers, new buying centers, it's about new markets. Our ability, where we take and create value, is there's a whole sea of opportunity out there. For us, we continue to do that. That's how we build the business. If you were asking your question thinking about it's just one wallet, that's not so. Our share of wallet, the world is the whole global wallet, and we're going to drive value everywhere across the board.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nMakes sense. Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right, let's close out the call. Thank you very much again for all those questions.\nObviously, my opportunity to thank the 35,000 people here at Mastercard for driving this value all across and leave you all with wishing you guys enjoying the rest of your summer. Thank you very much. Speak to you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the specifics from the quarter, a few themes stand out for me. First, we delivered a fantastic first quarter. Net revenues were up 17% and adjusted net income up 13% versus a year ago, as always on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. Second, we are successfully executing against a significant secular opportunity in payments. It's a core part of our growth algorithm and an opportunity in any economic environment.\nThird, we are at the forefront of digital transformation, delivering a diverse set of solutions that address the evolving needs of our customers, capabilities that make payments simple, smart, and more secure, and services that go beyond our rails and beyond payments.Now, let's get into the details. We're operating in an uncertain environment. Consumer and business sentiment has weakened primarily due to concerns surrounding the impact from tariffs and geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, so far this year the fundamentals that support consumer spending have been solid and our drivers are generally stable.\nNo matter what. It remains clear that we have intentionally embedded resiliency. We have a well diversified business both from a geographic and product perspective as well as across a wide range of discretionary and non-discretionary spend categories. We closely manage our expenses and have levers to pull if needed, and we remain focused on executing against our short-, medium-, and long-term objectives. There's a substantial opportunity for us to drive sustainable growth across consumer payments, commercial new payment flows, and Value-Added Services and Solutions. That's what I will focus on today.\nStarting with consumer payments. Our innovations including contactless capabilities and tokenization have become a foundation for payments in today's digital economy. Today, 73% of all in-person switch transactions are contactless, and approximately 35% of all our switch transactions are tokenized. These technologies will continue to play an important role as we move forward into the next phase of digital commerce such as agentic AI. We announced Mastercard Agent Pay delivers our Agent IQ tokens as well as franchise rules, fraud, and cybersecurity solutions.\nCombined, these will help partners like Microsoft facilitate safe, frictionless, and programmable transactions across AI platforms. We will also work with companies like OpenAI to deliver smarter, more secure, and more personalized agentic payments. The launch of Agent Pay is an important step in redefining commerce in the AI era. We are thrilled with these collaborations as we work together to scale and build trust in agentic commerce. We also continue to advance crypto payments with an end-to-end approach.\nWe're collaborating with cryptocurrency platforms to allow consumers to spend their cryptocurrencies including stablecoins at more than 150 million Mastercard acceptance locations worldwide. Kraken, OKX, and Bleap among our newest card issuance partners, helping to connect the crypto economy to everyday spending. Behind the scenes, we have enabled stablecoin settlement on the Mastercard network itself. We're working with fintech acquirers a new way to enable the option to settle payments in stablecoins for their merchants, and we help make these payments secure with Crypto Secure, now actively monitoring risks for hundreds of issuers globally.\nThis is in addition to our work on blockchain technology to unlock faster and more transparent cross-border B2B payments with our Multi-Token Network, which we discussed last quarter. Our consumer payment technologies also enable us to further capture the significant secular opportunity and expand into new markets. China, for example, as we approach the one-year anniversary of the first locally switched transaction, we launched domestic on-soil tokenization capabilities. These were developed through our joint venture to make online transactions more safe and secure. Additionally, we're working to scale commercial as well as consumer payments.\nOver the last year we have launched 10 new small business programs. We also continue to win and renew partnerships around the globe to drive growth in consumer payments. CIMB Niaga, Indonesia's second-largest private bank, has chosen to transition their international branded consumer card portfolio to Mastercard. We have embarked on this long-term partnership to help enhance customer acquisition and experiences through analytics and technology. We're also expanding our partnership with one of the leading regional financial groups in Latin America, Grupo Promerica, across eight countries.\nIn addition to incremental card issuance, they will utilize our consulting and data analytic capabilities to drive growth. Such strategic partnerships also play an important role unlocking cash and new consumers. There's tremendous secular opportunity in Africa. One way we unlock it is by partnering with mobile network operators across the continent. For example, we're partnering with MTN Mobile Money in Uganda to give their subscribers the option to pay using card credentials without the need for a physical card or a bank account. And in the UAE we're partnering with Al Etihad Payments to launch co-badge, debit, and prepaid cards with the domestic scheme Jaywan.\nThis gives us access to a new set of consumers and flows. In this large high growth market. Travel remains an important vertical and one where we are seeing continued success. Our acceptance footprint and robust service offerings are key to capturing this category of spending. This quarter we launched a new debit co-brand card with Wyndham Rewards, and we renewed our credit co-brand partnership with Spirit Airlines with an additional agreement to launch a new debit program with them in the future. Putting it all together, we are partnering in creative ways to win, share, and capture the secular shift.\nOur decades-long innovation in payments has placed that at the forefront of today's digital commerce, and now we're positioned to lead tomorrow's advancements such as Agentic AI in crypto. As I mentioned earlier. Commercial and new payment flows represent another large addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we launched two commercial point-of-sale solutions. Each combine our product capabilities in a modular way to meet the specific needs of varied businesses. Our Business Builder product combines commercial cards and tools to help entrepreneurial clients launch and scale their ventures. b1BANK will be among the first issuers to offer the program.\nWe developed Mid Market Accelerator to address the critical needs of the largest and fastest growing commercial segment, mid-market. It combines our digital payment technology, rewards, and security solutions with custom selected features like cash flow, and expense management tools. We're working with Citizens to bring this to market in the United States with plans to scale globally. Beyond commercial point-of-sale solutions, we are working to unlock the substantial invoice payment opportunity by enhancing our capabilities.\nWe entered into a new partnership with Corpay to enhance our current corporate cross-border payment solutions with industry-leading currency risk management and integrated large-ticket capabilities. This will give our financial institution partners a simple connection to a comprehensive suite of cross-border payment offerings regardless of ticket size and geography. At the same time, the partnership expands the distribution reach of Mastercard Move. This goes to a broader set of small- and mid-sized businesses, including the existing Corpay customers. Finally, we extended our agreement for Corpay to exclusively offer Mastercard virtual card programs to its customers.\nFurthermore, we're extending our leadership in virtual cards by making them easier for businesses. To access and deploy. We launched B2B Rate Manager to equip Mastercard virtual card issuers with a faster and more scalable way to implement and use flexible interchange rates. We're also streamlining the onboarding process for issuers to deliver embedded virtual card technology into partner platforms that end corporates use every day, such as HRS and Cvent. To further scale, we continue to embed our virtual card technology into widely used platforms.\nERP software company Odoo in collaboration with Stripe will exclusively issue Mastercard corporate cards integrated into Odoo's Expense module, available for their users in more than 20 countries. We're also seeing strong demand for our Mastercard Move capabilities. With transaction growth up more than 35% year over year this quarter, this solution has extensive reach and broad applicability to meet the ever-growing needs of customers, customers, and businesses. Let's look at some of the most interesting use cases here in the person-to-person space.\nWe now facilitate domestic transfers by simply tapping your phone, partnering with Samsung to power their new wallet P2P offering, and we support near real-time person-to-person cross-border remittances, adding partners like MoneyGram, InstaPay Technologies, and Curfex this quarter. Mastercard Move also enables disbursements like gig economy wage payouts to offer more flexibility and speed to businesses and individuals. Checkout.com is using Mastercard Move to help enable disbursement and payment use cases for the gig economy as well as for insurance and healthcare merchants.\nOur technology can also speed up purchase return payments within minutes rather than days or weeks, which is clearly something we can all benefit from. Worldpay is now using this with multiple UK merchants to deliver faster refunds across commercial point-of-sale invoice payments and Mastercard Move. We are expanding across use cases while making it easier and more attractive to use our solutions. The third pillar of our strategy is services and solutions. We've made targeted investments in diversified solutions in high growth areas.\nAs we said at the Investor Day last year, approximately 85% of our value added services and solutions revenues are recurring in nature, providing a stable baseline for growth, and we are well positioned for future growth as we continue to scale by further penetrating existing customers and targeting new buying centers, and new services. We are leveraging one-to-many distribution with global technology partners who can embed our services as part of their value proposition. Galileo will enable ethical alerts for most of their card portfolios and integrate our open banking powered capabilities onto their platform.\nGlobal cybersecurity company VikingCloud will distribute our risk scoring and cybersecurity remediation capabilities to further enable their small business clients to protect against cybercrime and financial crime prevention. Company Feedzai is extending their use of Mastercard's consumer fraud risk solution. It's already live in the UK with 14 major banks, and this partnership streamlines our ability to scale account-to-account fraud solutions to new markets globally.\nTo further penetrate existing customers, we bring differentiated solutions that drive impact throughout their value chain. This can be across consumer onboarding, activation, and usage, all the while making payments safe and secure. Our services help balance a positive frictionless consumer onboarding experience with ensuring consumers are who they say they are. Tangerine Bank in Canada is using our account opening identity solutions to do just that. In bringing our identity attributes and open banking solutions together, we have helped Experian enhance their digital checking account offerings within Experian Smart Money.\nOnce those customers are onboarded, our assets can support their ongoing engagement and loyalty resulting in improved customer satisfaction. For example, we help power Sam's Club's loyalty rewards program, and we're working with First Abu Dhabi Bank to develop an AI-powered concierge integrated into the bank's Mastercard offers platform. This innovative solution will help customers discover and access card offers and benefits in a contextual manner. Additionally, our business and market insight services help our customers with portfolio optimization.\nWe've combined our consulting expertise, analytics insights to help customers like Intesa Sanpaolo to optimize their program performance. We also provide tools to protect our customers and the ecosystem more broadly. Last year, we enhanced our AI-powered Decision Intelligence to supercharge our fraud scoring and detection rates, and it's working, detecting more than 40% more fraud versus Q1 last year. On the cybersecurity front, Recorded Future just unveiled Malware Intelligence. It's a new capability enabling proactive threat prevention for any business using real-time AI-powered intelligence insights. These are just two examples how we deploy AI.\nTaking a step back, AI is deeply ingrained in our business. We have access to an enormous amount of data, and this uniquely positions us to enhance our AI's performance, resulting in greater accuracy and reliability. We're deploying AI to enable many solutions in market today. In fact, in 2024, AI enabled approximately 1/3 of our products within Value-Added Services and Solutions. Simply put, our services are focused on areas that truly matter to our customers, both in payments and beyond. We're intentionally investing in areas like AI-powered threat intelligence that are rife with opportunities for growth.\nToday I've shared numerous wins, new partnerships, and new product innovations. The execution is evident and our momentum continues. So I want to wrap up with some key takeaways for you. We delivered another quarter of very strong results. We are monitoring the macro environment and prepare to adjust as needed. We have a broad set of solutions that drive value for our customers. We have a strong, resilient, and diversified business model and most importantly, we are focused on delivering our strategy and growth for the long term. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to page three, which shows our financial performance for Q1 on a currency neutral basis excluding, where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 17%, reflecting continued growth in our Payment Network and our value added services and solutions. Acquisitions contributed 1 PPT to this growth.\nOperating expenses increased 14%, including a 4 PPT increase from acquisitions, and operating income was up 19%, which includes a 1 PPT headwind from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 13% and 16% respectively, driven primarily by the strong operating income growth, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate due to the impact of the global minimum tax rules. Commencing in the current period, EPS was $3.73, which includes an 8 cent contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter we repurchased $2.5 billion worth of stock and an additional $884 million through 28 April 2025.\nNow turning to page 4, let's first look at some of our key volume drivers for the first quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 9% year over year. In the US GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 8%. This growth was impacted by the lapping of the Citizens debit portfolio migration to Mastercard which commenced in Q1 2024. Outside of the US, volume increased 10% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 12%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 15% globally for the quarter in line with expectations and reflecting continued growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.\nTurning now to page five, let's talk about switched transactions which grew 9% year over year in Q1. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 73% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 6% globally. There are 3.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for Q1 discussed on a currency-neutral basis.\nPayment Network net revenue increased 16%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transactions and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives, value-added services, and solutions. Net revenue increased 18%. This includes a 4 percentage point increase from acquisitions. The remaining 15% increase was driven primarily by the scaling of our security and digital and authentication solutions as well as demand for our consumer acquisition engagement services. It was also driven by growth in our underlying drivers and pricing. Now let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the Payment Network.\nAgain, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 12% while worldwide GDV grew 9%. The 2 PPT difference is primarily driven by mix and pricing. Cross-border assessments increased 18% while cross-border volumes increased 15%. The 3 PPT difference is primarily driven by pricing. In international markets, transaction processing assessments were up 17% while switched transactions grew 9%. The 7 PPT difference is primarily due to revenue related to FX volatility, favorable cross-border mix, and pricing. Other network assessments were $231 million this quarter.\nAs a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP, currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 14%, which includes a full PPT impact from acquisitions. This growth was primarily driven by increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Total adjusted operating expenses were lower than expected this quarter, primarily due to the cadence of expenses between Q1 and the remainder of the year.\nTurning now to page nine, let me comment on the operating metric trends for the first quarter and the first four weeks of April. Starting with Q1, we saw healthy consumer and business spending. Our operating metrics remained generally stable after adjusting for the following three items. First, the leap year in Q1 2024, which reduced Q1 2025 growth by over 1 PPT across switch volumes, switch transactions, and cross-border volumes. Second, the timing of Easter and other holidays. Easter occurred in April this year as compared to the end of Q1 in 2024.\nFinally, as it relates to cross-border travel, we saw a pull forward of spend into Q4 2024 from Q1 2025 as we mentioned on our last earnings call. Now turning to the first four weeks of April, sequentially switched volumes, switched transactions, and cross-border volumes also remain generally stable after adjusting for the points I just mentioned. Let me double-click on cross-border for a minute. Cross-border travel growth broadly remains strong, but we are seeing some moderation in select markets in the Middle East and Africa as they come off recent periods of extremely high growth. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel growth continued to be very strong.\nSumming it up, total cross-border continued to grow at a healthy clip with 16% growth year to date through 28 April on a local currency basis. Turning now to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. The headline is that our business remains strong and consumer spending remains healthy. On the macroeconomic front, the fundamentals that support consumer and business spending have been solid to date. Specifically, unemployment rates remain low, and for the most part, wage growth continues to outpace the rate of inflation. At the same time, increased economic and geopolitical uncertainty has weakened sentiment and creates risks.\nBut remember, our business is diversified, and that is true across products and services, discretionary and non-discretionary spend categories, domestic and cross-border spend, and countries and corridors. For example, when looking at cross-border corridor pairs, meaning the inbound and outbound flows between two countries, no cross-border corridor pair represented more than 3% of our total cross-border volume in 2024. This diversification brings resilience, as does our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We will continue to monitor the external environment and have expense levers to adjust if necessary.\nNow turning to our expectations for the full year 2025, our base case assumes consumer spending remains healthy. We continue to expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double digits to low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to add 1 to 1.5 PPT to this growth rate for the year. Given recent currency fluctuations, we now estimate a minimal impact from foreign exchange. From an operating expense standpoint, we continue to expect growth to be at the low end of a low double digits range versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to increase the OpEx growth rate for the year by approximately 5 PPT while we expect a minimal impact from foreign exchange. Now turning to the second quarter of 2025, year over year, net revenue growth is expected to be at the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a 1 to 1.5 PPT impact to this growth rate while we expect a minimal impact from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 growth to be at the low end of a low double digits range versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to have a 4 to 5 PPT impact to this OpEx growth while we expect a minimal impact from foreign exchange for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind on other income and expenses: In Q2, we expect an expense of approximately $135 million given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. This expense is higher than the first quarter primarily due to three factors. First, Q1 benefited from a one-time interest income impact related to a tax matter.\nSecond, we expect interest income to decrease in the second quarter due to an expected lower average cash balance, and third, we expect incremental interest expense in Q2 related to our recent debt issuance. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be at the 20% to 20.5% range for both Q2 and the full year based on the current geographic mix of our business.As a reminder, the Q1 tax rate was lower due to discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments in the first quarter, and with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Audra, you may now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please only press star one once to queue up for a question, as pressing star one multiple times may affect your position in the queue. Your first question comes from Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nSachin, can you give us more color on the composition of your cross-border business? I know you said no cross-border corridor is more than 3% of volume. Is it fair to say that travel is about 2/3, the remainder and within e-commerce there is the bulk of it, e-retail? Just trying to get a sense of, like, US inbound overall on travel and ecom. Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. Harshita. So just a little bit of color. One of the reasons why we wanted to kind of share that statistic which I did, which was around the fact that no cross-platform corridor pair is greater than 3% of total cross-border volume in 2024, was essentially to share with you that we have a very diversified portfolio. There is no overdependence on any one corridor pair, which actually is going to influence our numbers one way or the other. So that's kind of point number one. The second thing I'll mention to you is I think we had shared some statistics back a few years ago as it relates to what our mix of cross-border travel is vis-a-vis cross-border.\nTravel. This was back, I think it was during the COVID time frame where we had mentioned that card-not-present and card-present cross-border was roughly half and half, and 1/3 of the card-not-present was travel-related. So we've kind of given you some general sense on that, and you should assume with a business of our size that things generally tend not to move around big time over a course of a couple of years as it relates to the mix. So that's generally what we kind of shared with you there. As it relates to.The card-not-present ex-travel component, you could see some really solid growth there. You can see that in the metrics that we've got here.\nAnd look, I mean when COVID happened, COVID changed a lot of things, right? I mean the world went more digital, merchants went more omnichannel, more people were shopping online. And this was true both in the domestic environment as well as in the cross-border environment. And you're kind of seeing that sustained growth come through even now. So net net what I tell you is I feel pretty good about how our portfolio is positioned.\nWe continue to stay very focused in growing our portfolio which is cross-border focused for all the right reasons. Not every portfolio is going to be ones we'll go after, but the ones we do go after we see good promise for growth, and you're seeing that come through in the metrics which we've shared. Deal.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Andrew Jeffrey at Truist Securities.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nAnalyst, William Blair\n\nHi, William Blair these days, fortunately. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. I wonder if I could dig in a little bit on the economics of your tokenized offerings. Michael, I think you said they're 35%. 35%, I guess I'm assuming card-not-present transactions have tokenization or are now tokenized. Can you just speak to where you think that number can go and what that means economically for Mastercard over the next several years?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So first of all, this is, you know, our approach around tokenization. Very important technology drives more security, makes a user experience, and we wanted to scale this, and you, I gave you a stat already that 35% of our switched transactions are now tokenized. So initially the strategy was put it out there and get a base level offering across the world. And we said okay, let's start to build solutions on top of our tokenization platform, and we put in lifecycle management and the like, and we started to price for that because that is additional value that we put out, and we've seen the benefit of three quarters of that pricing from our international market.So.\nSo that is where we are today, and we're going to continue to monitor that there's great demand in tokenization. I gave you an update that even in China we build a locally based developed solution to drive the same kind of impact in China for us. When you start to think about where we are going, as we were talking about agentic commerce where again token technology is at the center of that, you can start to see there's a lot of value created, and, you know, our pricing strategies. We always strive to recoup some of our investments and share in the value that we create for our customers. So that's the broad direction.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Tien-tsin Huang at JPMorgan.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning, Michael, Sachin, and Devin. I want great results, of course, especially. On the growth side. Just want to dig into the operating. Expenses and the cadence there. Sachin, I think you said slow start to some spending. I just want to understand the cadence. A little bit more. What's discretionary versus non-discretionary growth versus maintenance, and I think there's some one-timers for Recorded Future integration. Just want to better understand that given it's running double digits overall. Thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure, Tien-tsin Huang. So on OpEx, like I mentioned, operating expense in Q1 came in slightly lower than what we had originally anticipated, primarily due to the cadence point which you were mentioning out here, which is specifically as it relates to there are several areas in which we were expecting to actually incur expense in Q1. For example, in A and M we were expect A and M being advertising and marketing, which I know you know, was expected to be higher, came in slightly lower.\nAgain, it's not because we're not going to do the spend; it's just a question of timing based on when sponsorships take place, when we have to activate around those sponsorships, when we do the media around those sponsorships. So that's kind of one area. But in addition to that, right. We do expect from a cadence standpoint that as the year continues, that you will see, particularly in the second half, an increase in operating expenses which will take place because we do have plans to make investments, and there are several areas which we will make investments on, such as investing in the great secular opportunity that Michael was talking about. Right.\nI mean, we've got this opportunity in front of us. We believe it's there in several markets across the globe. We do plan to invest in frontline resources to actually tap into that opportunity, and that would be one area. The second area I would tell you is around hardening of infrastructure. Right. This is something, as a Payment Network, which is really important. It's important that we continue to invest in our infrastructure in order to deliver to our customers what our customers expect from us. So that'll be another area where we'll be focused from an expense standpoint.\nAnd finally, I'll mention that we continue to see good growth from a services standpoint, and we'll continue to invest in areas from a services standpoint from a product development and capabilities perspective. So several areas. The cadence is like you said, it was a little lower in Q1. We expect it to ramp up as we go through the remainder of the year. We've given you guidance on operating expenses for Q2. So I think you can back into what we expect in the second half based on what I've given you in full-year guidance and what you kind of now have visibility for the first half of the year.\nOn your question on Recorded Future, again, we've shared with you what we think the impact of two acquisitions would be, which is Recorded Future and Minna, and Recorded Future being the larger of the two. And just as a reference point, at the last earnings call we had shared with you on these acquisitions that roughly 2.5 percentage points of the growth we are talking about from acquisitions is run-rate expenses, that is, the expense to run the business.\nApproximately 1% relates to the amortization of intangibles, and the remaining relates to one-time integration costs and other expenses, which we have to incur more in a one-time nature standpoint. Nothing's changed from what we shared with you three months ago.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning, Michael, Sachin. This might be a question for both of you. I know you're seeing resilience on the part of the consumer, but I'm just curious. If you just peel back the onion a little bit, is there anything that you're seeing that concerns you in terms of the health of the consumer and spending habits, especially with tariffs and such? I know like this quarter seemed to come in a little bit stronger than expected, but you're not revising the outlook. Just want to make sure that there's nothing. Is that just prudence or something you're seeing? Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nLet me start off and then Sachin. Obviously, has plenty of detail to deep dive in. So overall, I mean, first of all, we have a very unique lens on consumer spending. This is across the world. So we have regional data to look at, and I'll give you some highlights around that. The second thing is for us, we obviously look for trends and see what matters to consumers. And some of the fundamental truths that we put out into our 2025 economic outlook that we issued through the Mastercard Economics Institute was that we expect the consumer to remain engaged, that we expect the consumer to appreciate experiences and spend experience experiences.\nAnd the one thing that to be said about an engaged consumer, it also means it's a consumer that is leveraging all the tools that the digital economy offers the consumer in terms of finding what's the best deal, looking for the best deal. It's not so much about spending up and down, but it's also the choices.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nI don't think we're connected. Audra, can you hear us?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, we can. Please continue.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOkay. All right. We are connected. Very good. So the engaged consumer is using all the tools of the digital economy to make expense decisions and, you know, decide between discretionary and non-discretionary spending. So that's overall; none of this has changed in our data. We don't really see significant upfronting of spending. So that's not a trend that came through. That was a specific angle of your question. If I look across the board, this hasn't shown in any of the regions. In the US we see generally stable spending. Europe, a bit more of a challenging environment, but also generally spending in Asia.\nIf you look at another big region there, China came in a little bit ahead of what they said, what they initially had projected on their economic growth. And here we see tremendous spending coming through our data. But it's really driven by share gain, which is also something always to distinguish. So overall, nothing particularly concerning at this point in time. The headline of our trends have generally remained stable is very, very much spot on.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, Sanjay, I'll just add a couple of points here. You kind of talked about the beat in Q1, so a couple of things which I wanted to share with you. The beat in Q1 was primarily driven by two factors. One was higher levels of FX volatility and lower rebates and incentives than what our expectations were. And so when I kind of think about that and I think about the implications of the full year, I perfectly well expect that rebates and incentives, because it's a timing issue as far as I'm concerned, will actually occur as the year goes along. We continue to remain very active in the markets, we're going to continue to do the deals we need to do as part of that process.\nAnd as you and I both know, the FX volatility is super hard to predict. So you know, you know you had the tailwind from FX volatility in Q1, and that's what we've got. Other point I'll mention to you is you asked about, you know, what is the impact in addition to what Michael just mentioned, you know, what we are seeing is inbound into the US, and in terms of cross-border travel, you are seeing some level of moderation take place there, no question about it. This has been particularly true in the latter half of Q1 and going into the first four weeks of April. That being said, what you are seeing is what is not coming into the US is going into other regions.\nSo this is where the beauty of the diversified business model comes into play. So you are seeing actually better trends in terms of cross-border, for example, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific. And so again that's why when you look at the numbers in the macro, it shows you stability. But there are puts and takes which take place as part of the process.\nAnd as I mentioned, our concentration to any one currency corridor pair is less than 3% as it was in 2024. So feel pretty good about the diversified nature of the business. You know, time will tell where the world takes us. I mean, obviously there's a level of uncertainty and risk which is out there which we stand ready to actually not only monitor but act on as appropriate.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nSo we will monitor the tariff side of the equation, but we'll continue to.Monitor job creation. We will monitor employment. Rates, and we will monitor wage growth, which are on the other side of the coin. So that's the approach. Stay close and see where it goes and have the right solutions for our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Adam Frisch at Evercore ISI.\n\nAdam Frisch\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHey guys, good to be back with you. Two questions I have for you this morning. One, the potential impact of the Cap1 Discover deal. Trying to quantify the potential. Let's just take the worst case scenario to get that off the table. If their debit portfolio were to leave you guys, how should we think about that impact to your financials? And then the second question, and that was the worst case scenario. And then the second question is, how does China factor into being a contributor to your revenue projections in the near term? Is that still relatively small and not a major source or is it growing in importance in your future near term projections? Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nHey, Adam, welcome back. So, on your question around Capital One and Discover, look, I mean, like I mentioned in the last earnings call, right, the guide we've given you as it relates to our full year numbers contemplates our best estimate of what we think the impact of that. Transaction will be. I think Capital One has been fairly clear about their desire to migrate the debit portfolio over to the Discover network. And you know, that's very much contemplated in what we are thinking about in terms of our outlook for the year. Again, you know, there's a level of uncertainty associated with the timing. And the reason I say that is because the transaction has been approved.\nIt still needs to, you know, go through a period of, you know, getting into activity to actually make stuff happen there. So we'll keep you updated if there's any meaningful change relative to our expectations as we built into our full year guide on the Capital One Discover transaction.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOn your first just one point. So, you know, the relationship with Capital One has been a strong one for a number of years. We've grown together in the market. There are areas now in this setup where we'll continue to have a strong relationship. You have both organizations talk about that at the same time. There might be areas where we compete going forward, but that is not unique. We have many examples. You look at the acquiring space, for example, where we have great strategic partnerships on one hand and it will be certain aspects of our business where we compete. So we continue to expect a strong relationship with Discover. Sorry, actually was Capital One.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nAnd then on your question about China, look, I mean I think we've shared previously what our exposure to China was as it relates to both inbound and outbound. From a cross-border revenue standpoint, the lion's share of our revenue exposure to China is around cross-border. We do generate some amount of assessment revenue on our domestic volumes which are there. So net-net, what I would tell you is the impact on revenues of the joint venture is still pretty small. I mean it's still in ramp mode, it's still in invest mode I would say where we're investing in building out the programs Michael talked about and the exceptional acceptance infrastructure, so on and so forth.\nBut then as it relates to the business we've always had, as it relates to China around cross-border and on domestic, you know it's been, it's been fairly small. Again, going back to the diversification theme we've been talking about, and you know, we continue to do what we need to do in terms of driving that business. Just one data point I'd share with you as it relates to cross-border inbound and outbound from China, because this is something which people kind of track; we follow this closely as well. Cross-border travel volume inbound into China is now north of 100% of pre-COVID levels. Slightly north of 100%.\nAnd then outbound, the same metric outbound from China is running in the mid-80s, close to approximately 85% of pre-COVID level. So just in case you're interested in understanding what the recovery path is might look like on a going forward basis.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nNow, finally, to add, we now have the full tool set there. I mentioned tokenization capabilities. Obviously, participate in contactless and online transactions there. Now, earlier, there was a question about your external environment. We obviously closely monitor US-China relationships and all of this.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Trevor Williams at Jefferies.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the full year guide. Sachin, if you could talk to directionally at least what you're building in for the rest of the year across switched volume and cross-border. You've talked about lapping Citizens and how that's a dynamic to keep in mind. But if there's any other underlying deceleration assumed relative to the current run rates when we kind of normalize for the holiday timing in March and April. And then just any comment on what you're assuming for FX volatility, thanks very much.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. So a few thoughts for you on that one. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to assume our base case is that, you know, there's a strong consumer which continues to persist. Right. I mean, you know, that's what the fact and the data shows us so far. And you know, while there's a level of uncertainty which we talked about, that's what the current data is. So the base case is that the strength in consumer spending continues in terms of items which are unique to this year as we kind of go through the year, it's one is the fact which you mentioned, which is the lapping of the wins we had last year, which is going to start to come through as the year progresses.\nYou know, it started in Q1, it'll continue at more accelerated pace in Q2, and then it'll go on for the quarters to come. Just because that's kind of, that's the good news because you want portfolios, you've got the revenue associated that. But it does actually take down growth rate on a year over year basis. The other thing which you'll see is the lapping of certain amounts of pricing which was put in place last year. So that will also start to come through as the year progresses.\nAnd the last point I'd make is around, I mentioned earlier about R&I, and about how we had lower R&I in the first quarter, and that we expect for that to be something which will play out as the year progresses because we view that more as timing than anything else. So that should be very much part of how you're thinking about what we factor into the guide. The last point I'd mentioned is around FX volatility. On FX volatility, you will remember that last year in Q4 there were pretty high levels of FX volatility. So there's a tougher comp this year. I have no idea what FX volatility is going to look like. We do our best estimate in terms of what we think will happen.\nBut again, I'm proven wrong every day by my team about where that is going to actually show up both to the upside and the downside. So we do our best estimates around that. We put that into our guide and again, our guide's a range, right. So that's why we give you a range and so you should actually think about it in that manner.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks. Can we just touch for a minute on pricing? I know you talked about tough comps into the second half on pricing. Given some moves you made last year around, I think it was cross-border intra-organization. But when we think about the opportunities you have now into the second half, maybe just give us a sense of the level.\nIs it something that, do you see instituting new price opportunities that could be somewhat similar to what you did over the second half last year as the year progresses, even if it's not timed exactly, and then maybe just more holistically, what areas are you providing the value add that you, you think you can take more price from that you're most excited about on that front? Maybe in the backdrop of what the competitive dynamics look like these days. Thanks again, guys.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right, Darren. So pricing, the first thing to put out there is it's obviously a competitive market, and we generally price to market. More importantly, we price the value that we provide. And I believe we provide value across the whole range of our offerings. That's on the payment solutions as well as on the Value-Added Services and Solutions range of products that we put out there. So we will all continuously look for ways to recoup some of the investments and price for the value we do on the price on the payment side.\nGenerally, you know, the expectation should be as payments become more efficient and perform better, that that is an indicator of where the value is generated on the value-added, you know, value-added solutions and services. The approach really is to say, let's say on safety and security, what is the reduction in fraud that a customer can expect? And those are some of the indicators that we use to actually, when we sell these products, to talk to our customers. Well, here's the value you can expect, and hence the same as for the customer engagement and insights tools. But again, we say you can engage your customer so much better.\nTherefore, the ROI on your marketing spend is going to be improved, and that is what we do. So to your question, Darrin, it's across the board. We will continue to look for those opportunities as a matter of course as we run our business. There is no specific spikes or events planned into our outlook on that.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Timothy Chiodo at UBS.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director, UBS",
    "content2": "Great, thank you. I want to talk a little bit about wins and migration in general as it relates to unit economics. And some of the incentives timing, just because it's topical, given some of the lapping, conversions, and whatnot on the beginning of a contract. So we understand on the beginning end there's sort of a fixed component of R&I that hits before the portfolio fully ramps.\nAnd then on the end of a contract when something is about to be converted away or migrated away, like in the case of Capital One, we understand that sometimes the incentives can be either turned off or diminished during that time period. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the beginning and the end of those contracts in terms of incentives. The fixed, the variable component and add any context there.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. So, I think you got it right as it relates to, you know, when we get into a contract and every contract's different, but when we get into a contract, we typically are incentivizing our customers to bring volume onto the system. Right. That's kind of the starting point. That could be a combination of fixed incentives or variable incentives or both. More often than not, it's both. There's rebates as well. Rebates are, you know, just a component of. When I say incentives, just think about it as rebates and incentives in totality. You know, the way it works is the variable component varies with volume. It's as simple as that. Right. As volumes occur, you pay the related rebates and incentives.\nThere are adjustments which take place to that, because you have to make projections as to what you think your volume outlook is going to be, and you actually accrue your incentives on that basis. On the fixed component, the amortization of fixed incentives commences when programs launch. That's kind of when it starts. And they're typically straight-lined over the life of the contract. Right. The second part of your question is, at the end of the contract, what happens? And the answer to that is, it depends on the customer, and it depends on the dialogue we're having with the customer.\nThe reason I bring that up is, you know, to the extent there's an opportunity, let's say there's a contract which is expiring and we don't end up renewing it, but there are, let's say, three other opportunities which we could have with that customer. You might actually end up in a situation where you're having a negotiation around, we're not going to get what we had in the past, or we're only going to get a portion of what we had in the past, but we're going to get three other things as part of the deal.\nAnd so you actually will have a brand new negotiation which will take into consideration not only the incentives you're going to pay on the new volume you get, but also leverage a portion of what might be coming off in the nature of incentives. You don't have to pay on the contract which you signed it. So I'll give you an example back in, I think it was the middle of sometime in 2014, 2015, right. When we started to migrate volume off of our network as it relates to Chase. You know, at that point in time, there was a period of time when we went back to rack rates. In other words, we weren't paying incentives on the volumes there. Right.\nThere have been other instances where we've lost portfolios on one side, but one other portfolio where you kind of leverage your dialogue with the customer to have the benefit of being able to have a continuity which is there. So you're not always going to see the ramp up take place in terms of going to rack rates. It also depends, by the way, on the timing. Right. Depending on what level of readiness the customer has got from a migration standpoint. So the customer at the end of the contract needs, call it a year, year and a half, two years. Right.\nYou might have an opportunity to actually work with the customer to try and see if there are opportunities there as well to either win new portfolios and or potentially go to rack rate. So I know I'm not giving you the kind of answer you're looking for, which is give me an answer as to whether it's one or the other. It depends. Right.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nYou know, when you look at our relationships, earlier I was referencing in my prepared remarks the term of strategic partnerships. That's exactly how we look at it. It's not just a relationship. So, you know, if we grew with somebody in consumer payments, you know, we have a real big focus on commercial new payment flows, and this is how we toggle that. It's a long-term view in all cases. The one other thing I would say is just remind everybody about the virtuous cycle of growth. More payment volume. It's always in focus for us. It's going to power more data, and more data allows us to drive more services. So that is the other lens that we take when we look at all of this.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Craig Maurer at FT Partners.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nYeah, hi, thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask. As we look to help investors think about assets that can outperform in a slowing environment, I wanted to ask you guys what you thought were the idiosyncratic pieces of your business that might allow you to perform better than peers or competitors as things slow. What are the unique assets you have that could perform better in a slowing environment versus others? Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, great question. And I want to anchor it on the nature of our highly diversified business. And that is an answer that I would have given you even if you had asked after growth areas in fast growing environments and not only in slow growing environments, because the diversification helps us both ways and I think that's important. And clearly the economic picture isn't always even across the world. So we keep both of that in mind. Now, another important aspect about our business is.\nHaving payments and having a secular trend where payments move from cash and checks into digital is an underlying powerful secular trend that continues. In ups and downs, economic ups and downs, this will continue. In fact, if you look into the commercial space, more and more firms are right now going and pushing digitized payments and particularly card payments because they provide them more data so they can use that data to better serve their customers, optimize their processes, or improve their working capital usage.\nHere's an underlying powerful trend that survives, you know, the up and down of the overall economic picture at any given moment at some medium- to long-term trend. There's other such trends that we have very specifically targeted for our services solutions. Take cybersecurity.We're in a world where the fraudsters, the scammers, the phishers are using artificial intelligence as much as we do. This is a constant battle. Our customers are seeing that, financial institutions seeing that, governments are seeing that. If anything, the rise of cybersecurity, the need for cybersecurity measures has increased. Powerful underlying trend.\nThen, the last thing I should say is all of the, pretty much all of our solutions do one thing for our customers. They provide more data for them to run their business better and make better decisions. Now, in a world of up and down cycles, you understand your customer better. You want to understand how you put possibly different solutions out there than you otherwise have. You want to understand how you perform against your competitor with even more rigor than before. That is where we can help.\nThat's another powerful trend. Cybersecurity data insights and the underlying secular opportunity. Those are in addition to the fact that we are across discretionary, non-discretionary spend, that we are across literally every part of the world, makes us a very, very well-diversified business in challenging economic times, but also in fast-growing times.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, good morning. You know, Sachin wanted to ask high level, you know, we were at net revenue growth of 16% in Q4 and we actually increased a point to 17% in Q1 despite, you know, a little bit of a volume slowdown. Part of that is due to leap year, as you said, but the net revenue growth maintains at that high level and it looks like transaction processing yields in particular jumped a little bit higher.You know, how much can you help us explain, you know, despite volumes going down to make sure we understand the growth that was maintained or even upticked a point into Q1 and it doesn't sound like FX volume would be all of it.\nAnd then, just thinking about going forward into the second quarter, if some of those benefits, volume to revenue and yields, will continue.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. So I think you kind of touched upon the answer to the question right there, which is, you know, the lift you saw in Q1 was driven by two factors. One is the FX volatility point which you just raised. I mean it was, you know, volatility levels were actually really high in the first quarter, and that certainly contributed. And then the second was the point I made earlier in the call around our rebates and incentives came in lower than expected in the first quarter, which we expect will happen later in the year. But that's what we kind of saw come through the second part of your question as to, you know, the. And remember also that 17% number actually has the impact of acquisitions in there.\nSo you know, you have to actually do it like kind from Q4 to Q1 with and without acquisitions. Then as it relates to your question about Q1 versus Q2, the things to keep in mind out there are there is a ramp up of the lapping of various wins we had last year, which again I spoke about. There's lapping of pricing, which is taking place, and the reality is FX vols are really hard to predict. I'll tell you in the early part of April, you had decently high FX vols. We factored that into our thinking, which we've shared with you, and then they started to taper off. Now I don't know if they're going to go up again or come down again. We put our best estimates together, and that's how we think about it.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nIt's time for one more question, Audra.\n\nOperator\n\nthank you. We'll take that question from Paul Golding at Macquarie.\n\nPaul Golding\n\nAnalyst, Macquarie Capital\n\nThanks so much. It seems based on the commentary that there's been added focus on crypto and enabling crypto tools. Just wanted to ask how you're thinking about the economics of incorporating those crypto partnerships if you're seeing acceleration there, and how that may or may not be impacting your relationship with traditional issuers as stablecoin has become a bigger part of the story here in the last couple quarters. Thanks so much.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right, so this is a very interesting space. You heard us talk about digital assets and blockchain-based technology. For years we've been investing, but it's also true that it hasn't been a tremendously big part of our business. We've seen the on-ramp and off-ramp part of facilitating investments into crypto assets and selling those investments for some time now. You know that that was a fast-growing business. But the fundamental technology to put to work to optimize payments, for example, is something that's still relatively nascent. Stablecoins is also relatively nascent. Why is that? Because there isn't yet sufficient and regulatory clarity now in the United States, we know there is.\nYou know, there's two bills that are being discussed around the space. In Europe, you know, lawmaking is going on around the space. So we feel the ecosystem is ready. We have been engaging with partners in the financial institution. Sides to your question to put out some pilots, particularly in the wholesale space. There is, you know, private sector initiatives on stable stablecoins. One thing that's for sure true is if you look at the role that we play today in the traditional card payment space is we establish safety and security standards, we provide interoperability.\nYou think about a world of stablecoins, you can start to see there's a natural role emerging yet again for somebody like us who can provide trusted interoperability. So safety and security standards and a need for our services across identity questions, AML, KYC, you name it, across the board. So it's a space that's still emerging at this point in time. We mentioned our Multi-Token Network. How will the economic model look like at this point in time? Early to say. It has to settle. We have to see how it grows once we have the regulatory clarity. Personally, I'm quite excited about it. Payment innovation is something that's clear. The US government hasn't focused, and many others do as well, and we're a trusted partner in that space.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nAny closing comments, Michael?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThe closing comment is I'm delighted that Sachin and I are together in one room in New York again. We haven't had that for a long time, so that's fantastic. Of course I do want to thank everybody at Mastercard for all the hard work that you do to produce such a strong quarter. We're looking into the new year with optimism, into the rest of the year with optimism. We're going to push on and speak to you in a quarter from now. Thank you very much.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. We finished the year strong. Q4 net revenues were up 16% and adjusted net income up 19% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. Our diverse capabilities in payments, services, and solutions, including the acquisition of Recorded Future this quarter, set us apart. They also position us well for long-term growth, as we outlined at our investor day. This is what you will see in the new and expanded partnerships we will discuss this morning.\nThe macroeconomic environment continues to perform well, and it is underpinned by healthy consumer spending, as we've seen in today's news. The labor market is strong with low unemployment and continued wage growth. Inflation has moderated, but to varying degrees across categories and countries. Consumers remain engaged.\nAffluent consumers have benefited from the wealth effect, while the mass segment remains supported by the labor market. Our economics institute expects a year of global economic expansion in 2025, defined by shifts in monetary and fiscal policy, albeit geopolitical concerns remain. Overall, we remain positive about our growth outlook. We will continue to monitor the external environment and stand ready to adjust if needed.\nWe remain hyper-focused on successfully executing on what we can control. Our strategic priorities, which fuel our growth algorithm as we laid out in detail at our investor day, those three strategic priority areas include consumer payments, commercial and new payment flows, and services and solutions. A clear proof point on how we're executing is our steady drumbeat of share wins across products and geographies.\nNow, I often highlight our larger wins on these calls with you, but it's important to note that our local teams are competing for and winning deals of all sizes based on the differentiated value that we provide. Having a diverse portfolio with customers of all types is essential. It allows us to further expand our customer base and enables us to break into new areas where we can partner and grow together.\nIn 2024, we flipped or expanded hundreds of relationships globally. Let's first focus on the US, where we have won several large flips over the last few years. That momentum continued this quarter. ICBA Payments, which serves thousands of community banks, will significantly expand its partnership with Mastercard. This includes card issuance across their partner banks' credit and debit portfolios. Mid-Florida, a large credit union, will migrate their credit and debit portfolios to us.\nBoth partners highlighted our differentiated product suite, analytics capabilities, and the expertise of our people as a key in their decision to expand their relationship with Mastercard. In the public sector space, we renewed our long-standing relationship supporting the Direct Express program, one of the largest social benefit card programs in the world. Direct Express disburses benefits, including Social Security, veterans, and disability, onto Mastercard cards held by over 3 million Americans.\nThe momentum also continues in the travel and retail verticals. Porter Airlines and Bank of Montreal will launch a new co-brand program with us in Canada. In the US, we renewed our consumer and small business co-brand credit card partnership with IHG and Chase. They will leverage our data analytics and loyalty assets to enhance their value proposition. We renewed our co-brand partnership with Sam's Club, who will continue to leverage our products and services.\nOur success extends across all regions, with several significant renewals and expansions. We secured long-term exclusivity on debit with Saudi National Bank. We renewed and strengthened our partnership with New Bank. We've extended our relationship with Banco Santander in the UK. We successfully renewed our global premier credit card agreement with HSBC in over 20 countries. All these wins are a result of the successful execution of the strategic priorities we discussed at investor day. I will share a few highlights on each area, starting with consumer payments.\nNow, these flows represent a long runway of opportunity for sustained growth. Today, there's over $11 trillion and 1.5 trillion transactions in cash and check around the world. We are capitalizing on the significant secular opportunity by expanding acceptance, reimagining checkout, opening closed-loop systems, and enabling new verticals.\nFirst up, we're positioned to be the most accepted payments network in the world, with around 150 million acceptance locations globally today. Second, we are reimagining checkout, and that is our 2030 global plan to phase out manual card and password entry online in favor of smiles and fingerprints. Not only is that a better experience, but it's also more secure, and it's fully aligned with our data privacy principles. The online space needs that. Fraud rates are seven times higher online than in store.\nApproximately 25% of online shopping carts are abandoned because checkout is just too slow. Our tokenization and biometric capabilities sit at the heart of these solutions. Need proof? Well, in 2024, we tokenized about 4 billion transactions per month, which is up 40x over the past six years. As we have said in the past, there are many use cases for tokens.\nTake, for example, the next click of our multi-option payment solutions. We're rolling out the Mastercard One Credential, which allows consumers the flexibility and control to set their payment preferences in their banking app for each transaction, if they so choose to, be it credit, debit, prepaid, or buy now, pay later, all behind one credential, one token. The merchant, the merchant accepts that through the same simple and secure digital connections as always. No added work. Tokens provide tremendous value, and we offer a set of services on and around those tokens, such as lifecycle management and authentication, which enhance that value.\nNow, while the growth of tokens makes the ecosystem safer and more secure, we also benefit from the natural tailwind associated with the growth of token usage. Shifting gears, we're also driving incremental volume and transactions in our network by opening up closed-loop systems.\nBeyond the transit opportunities we talked about many times, we're also partnering with local wallet providers to create greater simplicity and access for the end consumer. In Sweden, we're working with Swish so that users can tap to pay and store both domestically and abroad by adding their Mastercard to the Swish app. In Latin America, we collaborated with Davivienda to co-create a digital-first debit product aimed at driving financial inclusion.\nWe signed an exclusive partnership with them to launch the product on the DaviPlata digital app. Our Pay Local service seamlessly connects with local digital wallets, enabling consumers who use Mastercard to make card payments across a broader set of local merchants. At the same time, merchants benefit from access to more consumers and the protections we provide.\nThe solution supports local tourism, that market that we traveled to where we couldn't pay, provides a seamless consumer experience, and helps drive cross-border volumes. Building on partnerships with leading wallet providers like Alipay and GrabPay, several additional players in Asia-Pacific will now open their wallets to cards. This includes DANA in Indonesia, Touch 'n Go in Malaysia, Bakong in Cambodia, and LankaPay in Sri Lanka. We're also capturing new verticals like consumer bill payments.\nThis quarter, we partnered with Bemobi in Brazil. Bemobi will integrate Click to Pay into their bill payment platform, enabling fast and secure payments for recurring services like telecoms and utilities. Now, as a network company, we're focused on enabling the broader ecosystem. That's exactly what we have been doing in the crypto sector.\nWe have a well-planned, balanced strategy that serves financial institutions, crypto players, and of course, consumers to drive growth and provide choice in this space. We're partnering with a wide range of crypto players to enable consumers to buy cryptocurrencies on card and spend their crypto balances anywhere that Mastercard is accepted. I'm very excited about new partnerships with Crypto.com and MetaMask, just a few of the many new players we have added in 2024.\nWe're enthusiastic about the future of blockchain technology. To reach its full potential, we believe there's a need for sound governance, interoperability, and real-world use cases. All this is a core competency of ours built over decades. To meet these needs, we developed the multi-token network MTN. This quarter, we partnered with Kinexys by JPMorgan, the firm's blockchain-based unit, to integrate MTN as a payment settlement solution.\nBy bringing together the power and connectivity of Mastercard's MTN with Kinexys' digital payments, we aim to unlock greater speed, transparency, and faster settlement capabilities for cross-border B2B payments. Now, while it's early days, we're excited about the opportunities which digital assets can bring to the world of payments as the space evolves, complementing our existing solutions.\nNow, while consumer payments offer a significant runway for growth, commercial flows represent an even larger $80 trillion serviceable, addressable market. Only about $3 trillion is carded today. In 2024, our commercial credit and debit volumes represented 13% of our total GDV and grew at 11% year-over-year on a local currency basis, just to give you the latest stats. On top of that, disbursements and remittances represent an additional $20 trillion in addressable market.\nWe're pursuing that opportunity with Mastercard Move, where transactions were up over 40% year-over-year in the Q4. Let's dig into commercial. First, we're expanding our global leadership in virtual cards by expanding across use cases, geographies, and verticals. For example, partnering with NatWest to distribute our new mobile VCN to UK companies and their employees. We're deploying virtual cards with Citi in Argentina, the first deployment of VCN in that market. In the travel vertical, we've established new partnerships with Worldpay and Emirates NBD to offer virtual cards to their customers.\nWe're also leaning into our success in travel and applying it to new high-potential verticals, for example, trade and logistics. Building on our previous announcement with DP World, we're driving continued growth in this sector. Global FinTech Invoice Bazaar will distribute new co-branded Mastercards to help digitize payments across the trade ecosystem.\nSimilar in consumer packaged goods, we partner with Deem Finance and Prime Dash to enable small businesses in the Middle East to automate payments to Coca-Cola distributors. This builds on partnerships with leading beverage distributors in Latin America that I spoke about in previous calls. We have good momentum on connecting small business in this space. We're also driving small business growth through expanded issuer partnerships. We signed an exclusive commercial deal with BNA, the state-owned bank in Argentina.\nAMP Bank in Australia will launch Mastercard debit cards for their new digital SME and consumer bank. Ant International's WorldFirst will expand our partnership to now issue virtual cards for SMEs and new markets, including Singapore and Australia. Now, let me turn to our third strategic priority: services and solutions. As we outlined at our investor day, services represent a serviceable, addressable market of at least $165 billion.\nWe delivered almost $11 billion in service and solutions revenue in 2024, $11 billion. That's exciting, but it's equally exciting that we're less than 7% penetrated. That's a significant runway for growth. We have a clear plan to execute against it. First, we're developing and launching differentiated products. This quarter, we launched new services to support customer acquisition, provide unique market insights, manage subscriptions, and identify threats. This includes closing on the acquisitions of both Minna Technologies and Recorded Future. Let's stay right there.\nCybercriminals have been around for decades, but attacks and fraud attempts are increasing at high levels as commerce increasingly moves online and as AI becomes more prevalent. Our investments, both organic and inorganic, are key to fighting fraud and protecting the ecosystem. They also drive revenue growth. Add Recorded Future to this list. It is now part of Mastercard.\nRecorded Future is the world's largest threat intelligence company with more than 1,900 customers across 75 countries. Customers include over 50% of the Fortune 100 and government agencies in 45 countries, including more than half of the G20. We've been deploying AI at scale for well over a decade, so has Recorded Future. They leverage AI-powered insights to analyze threat data from every corner of the internet, and customers gain real-time visibility and actionable insights to proactively reduce risks.\nWe now have an even more robust set of powerful intelligence, identity, dispute, fraud, and scam prevention solutions. Together, these uniquely differentiated technologies will enable us to create smarter models, distribute these capabilities more broadly, and help our customers anticipate threats before cyberattacks can take place. That means better protection for governments, businesses, banks, consumers, the entire ecosystem, and well beyond the payment transactions.\nWe're also leveraging our distribution at scale to deepen market penetration of our services and solutions. For example, we provide a fraud solution that facilitates real-time information sharing between merchants, issuers, and consumers to streamline disputes and reduce chargebacks. This quarter, we announced a new partnership with Stripe, who will offer these capabilities to their millions of users. In Latin America, Itaú Unibanco will make them available across its digital channels to support millions of cardholders.\nIn loyalty, we partnered with Nordea to consolidate their loyalty offering with Mastercard and launch new cashback offers across Norway and Sweden. We're also selling into new buying centers with traditional customers, opening up a larger share of wallet. For example, we partnered with the CISO at Webster Bank to deploy RiskRecon and Cyber Quant solutions.\nFinally, we're seeing strong demand for our services and solutions across a more diverse customer base, including online delivery services, gaming companies, and travel partners. For example, we expanded our partnership with DoorDash, who will use our insights and analytics to optimize business performance globally. Sony PlayStation will leverage our capabilities to showcase digital receipts to cardholders and banking apps and provide purchase information to banks' call center agents. Currencie will incorporate our open banking capabilities to support Hilton's new debit co-brand offering.\nServices and solutions are a large and growing revenue opportunity. They are essential, powerful virtuous cycle with our payments. We're laser-focused on executing and capitalizing on the significant runway and services in front of us. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, close out another strong year. There's significant opportunity ahead.\nThe fundamentals of our business are strong, so I'm very optimistic about the future for us, for us here at Mastercard. Our proven growth algorithm and differentiated solutions position us to deliver and to win, as we've demonstrated time and time again. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Sachin.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nWell, great. Thanks, Michael. Turning to page three, which shows our financial performance for the Q4 on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items, and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 16%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Acquisitions had a minimal impact to this growth. Operating expenses increased to 15%, including a one PPT increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 17%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions.\nNet income and EPS increased 19% and 22%, respectively, driven primarily by the strong operating income growth and further aided by a discrete tax benefit recognized in the Q4. EPS was $3.82, which includes a $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $644 million through 27 January 2025.\nLet's turn to page four, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the Q4 on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 12% year-over-year. In the US, GDV increased by 9%, with credit growth of 8% and debit growth of 11%. Credit and debit growth was aided by the conversions of the previously announced Wells Fargo commercial credit and Citizens debit migrations, respectively.\nOutside of the US, volume increased 13%, with credit growth of 11% and debit growth of 14%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 20% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. Turning to page five, switch transactions grew 11% year-over-year in Q4. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents approximately 72% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 6%.\nGlobally, there are 3.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Turning now to slide six for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the Q4, discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 15%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives.\nValue-added services and solutions net revenue increased 17%. Acquisitions contributed approximately half a PPT to this growth. Growth was primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers, strong demand for our consumer acquisition and engagement, and business and market insight services, the scaling of our security, digital, and authentication solutions, and pricing. Now, let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network.\nAgain, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is primarily driven by cross-border mix. Cross-border assessments increased 24%, while cross-border volumes increased 20%. The four PPT difference is primarily driven by pricing in international markets. Transaction processing assessments were up 15%, while switch transactions grew 11%. The four PPT difference is primarily due to favorable cross-border mix and pricing.\nOther network assessments were $239 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees, and they may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to page eight, you can see that on a Non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 15%, which includes a one PPT impact from acquisitions. Total adjusted operating expenses were higher than anticipated, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition expenses.\nThe acquisition of Recorded Future closed earlier than expected in Q4 2024 versus originally expected in Q1 2025, and was therefore not part of our Q4 forecast. Excluding acquisitions, the growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Now, turning to page nine, let me comment on the operating metric trends.\nStarting with Q4, our switched volume metrics were strong, with sequential increases versus the prior quarter driven by healthy consumer and commercial spending. As was the case with switched volumes, cross-border volumes also benefited from healthy spending, easier comps, as well as a pull forward of travel spend. Specific to cross-border card-not-present volumes, we saw an uptick due to the purchases of cryptocurrency in Q4.\nOf note, the timing of high volume versus low volume calendar days, as well as the timing of Black Friday, impacted switched volume and cross-border metrics within the quarter. Transaction growth remained flat sequentially as compared to volumes due to higher average ticket sizes in Q4. Now, looking through the first four weeks of January, the metrics are holding up well and are generally in line with the Q4.\nThe increase in switched volume growth in the US was primarily driven by an easier comp. Specifically, severe weather events across the country negatively impacted volumes this year and last year. However, the impact was more pronounced last year. As it relates to the decrease in intra-Europe cross-border volumes, this is primarily driven by the mix of calendar days and travel spend pull forward I just mentioned. Turning to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2025.\nLet me start by saying that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are well positioned for the opportunities ahead, driven by a diversified business model, the significant opportunity for further secular shift to digital forms of payment in both consumer and commercial, and strong demand for our differentiated value-added services and solutions.\nThe macro environment remains supportive of our base case, reflecting healthy consumer spending, and we remain confident in our ability to successfully execute our strategy while maintaining a disciplined capital planning approach. Overall, we are positive about the growth outlook for the short, medium, and long term. As it relates to our expectations for full year 2025, we expect net revenues to grow at the high end of low double digits to low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions.\nWe estimate a headwind of approximately 2 PPT from foreign exchange, while acquisitions are expected to add 1 to 1.5 PPT to this growth rate for the year. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect growth to be at the low end of a low double digits range versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items.\nWe expect a tailwind of approximately 1 to 2 PPT from foreign exchange, while acquisitions are forecasted to increase the OpEx growth rate for the year by approximately 5 PPT. To be clear, this impact of acquisition-related expenses was already contemplated in the three-year performance objectives that we shared with you last November at our investor community meeting. Let's dig into the acquisition-related expenses a bit.\nWe closed the acquisition of Recorded Future and Minna Technologies at the very end of 2024, and now we will see a full year impact in 2025. The 5 PPT impact can be broken down into three main components. Slightly more than 2.5 PPT relates to the run rate expenses for operating the business. Approximately 1 PPT is from the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the purchase price allocation, and the remaining relates to integration costs and other one-time expenses.\nNow, let me remind you about our acquisition philosophy. As you know, our acquisitions are strategy-led. We purchase companies that are complementary to our capability suite, and they add to our addressable market. These companies are primarily in earlier stages with modest revenues compared to Mastercard, albeit fast-growing. At the same time, these companies are in investment mode to drive longer-term growth.\nPost-acquisition, we look to scale revenues, drive synergies, and ultimately deliver positive operating leverage over the medium term, consistent with how we run our overall business. Now, turning to Q1 2025, year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a 1 to 1.5 PPT impact to this growth rate, while we expect a headwind of approximately 3 PPT from foreign exchange for the quarter.\nFrom an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 growth to be in the low double digits range versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a 4 to 5 PPT impact to this OpEx growth, while we expect a tailwind of approximately 2 PPT from foreign exchange for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind.\nOn other interest expenses, in Q1, we expect an expense of approximately $120 million given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 20% to 21 for the full year and approximately 20% for Q1, based on the current geographic mix of our business.\nA lower forecasted tax rate for Q1 as compared to the balance of the year is consistent with prior years due to expected discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments in the Q1. With that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Julianne, you may now open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please only press star one once to queue up for a question, as pressing star one multiple times may affect your position in the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, Michael. Hey, Sachin. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Good metrics across the board here. Great to see. If I could just dig into the cross-border piece, the month-to-date trends through 28 January, if you could talk about just the drivers of the growth there, whether it was relatively similar to the Q4, and then expectations for 2025. Then if I could just sneak one more in, just thinking about 2025, we get a lot of questions on the Capital One to Discover, maybe some thoughts about how you're thinking about that with respect to the model. Thanks so much.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. No problem, Andrew. I'll take that question. From a cross-border volume standpoint, just at the highest level, what I'm going to remind you is the value prop we offer from a cross-border standpoint continues to be incredibly solid. Our teams are out there. They're working hard.\nThey're winning various kinds of portfolios, some of which Michael spoke about even today about, which is some of the co-brand programs we've got with various airlines, etc., etc. Specific to your question around the metrics, again, really good performance from a volume growth standpoint, and cross-border at 20% for Q4.\nFirst of all, what you're seeing for the first four weeks of January is exactly that. It's the first four weeks of January. What you're seeing in the nature of the 20% going down to 18% is going back exactly to the comments I made in my prepared remarks, which is at the end of the day, the vast majority of that you're seeing come through in intra-Europe, which is primarily being driven by two factors.\nOne is a pull forward of travel spend into the month of December, and you can see those metrics because you'll see intra-Europe growth in December at about 23%. Then there's the calendarization of days, which I kind of mentioned to you as well. Those are the two factors, but fundamentally, the health of what we're seeing from an overall spend standpoint on cross-border continues to be excellent.\nWe have no real reason to believe that going forward that there's something going to change as it relates to the value prop. Obviously, the strength of cross-border as well as domestic spend is a function of how consumer health is. Right now, we're seeing the consumer to be in very good shape. We also mentioned about how commercial is actually performing well, and you know that commercial actually also lends to our cross-border metrics, so something to keep in mind out there as well.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right. On the Capital One, Andrew, let me start, and then I happily hand it to Sachin for the model side of the question. Overall, the acquisition is in flight as we know, it's going through the motions. I think it's fair to say the indications are positive that it will be approved. There's a whole range of examples where we have strategic partners who we also compete with on certain aspects of the business. Look in the acquiring space, for example. This is not a new situation for us. Now, Capital One is a tremendous partner to ours, a highly strategic partner, tremendous growth that we've seen in our joint business. They have been public about shifting debit volumes to the Discover network.\nNow, we are a competing network, and we will continue to invest in our network and ensure that we have a leading and differentiated solution out there. At the same time, we've been growing together in credit and other parts of the business. We value this partnership. We'll continue along those lines. Fundamentally, there are no surprises here to what we've said last time around, Sachin.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah. I'll just add to what Michael said. Like Michael said right now, right? I mean, they've talked about, Capital One has talked about migrating the debit volumes over. I think you're aware about the fact that those debit volumes are primarily on the Mastercard network. We've built in our best assumptions, both from a timing and a migration pace standpoint, into the full year thoughts that I've shared with you today.\nAgain, things might move around, and they likely will just because ours is a forecast. There's no predictability. The deal's got to get approved. Migrations have to start, but we've built in our best estimates as to how that's going to roll out.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOne last thing. I should add one more thing. I talked about it in my prepared remarks earlier. There's great momentum in debit, which we have created in the US. This isn't the only partner that we have, and we're building out the set of partnerships.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Nice job. Just to follow up on what we learned at your investor day, which was really helpful on the long-term trajectory of growth, if we could just take that and then put it into 2025, what are you expecting more specifically around your value-added services in the year ahead of us that we're in right now versus the consumer payments just to triangulate with growth?\nMaybe, Sachin, also just as a reminder, we're exiting the year at a 16% constant currency growth. Obviously, Discover could be a factor, but what other comps or lapping? Just remind us how much is in the outlook for lapping or other factors that could cause a deceleration from the exit rate down to the 12% to 13% from 16%. Thanks again, guys.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. No problem. First, a new question around value-added services and solutions. Look, I mean, it goes back to what Michael said, Darrin, in his prepared remarks, which is we continue to invest in that space. Continue to build out excellent capabilities, which are going after what is a sizable and fast-growing addressable market. Again, we're not giving you a forecast as it relates to what we expect value-added services and solutions to grow in 2025, but the underlying fundamentals of what we're doing there continue to be very healthy.\nAgain, remember, we gave you a little bit of color investor day as to what the composition of those revenues are, what the drivers of those revenues are, including payment network drivers, including what we're doing from an overall safety and security standpoint versus consumer engagement and acquisition standpoint. There's a lot of good stuff going on, and this is broad-based. It is not region-specific.\nI just want to be clear. Sometimes people think about this as highly US-centric or maybe US and Europe. The reality is across the globe, we're working hard. The teams are working incredibly hard to actually keep pushing value-added services and solutions. We close the year strong again there, right? I mean, now again, remember, value-added services and solutions is one of those things where quarter-over-quarter, you might see some level of variability, but the reality is overall, the fundamentals of the business continue to be very strong.\nThen your second question was around the fact that we closed Q4 exit rates at about 16% on a local currency basis, and you're kind of doing this compare with what the thoughts for 2025 are. A few things to keep in mind. Number one, there's a few things going on.\nNumber one, you've got basically the fact that you'll know we talked about pricing coming on, starting off Q2 2024, ramping up in Q3 and Q4. You're going to start to see some level of lapping take place on that. We've had several significant wins in 2024, the likes of Citizens, the likes of Wells Fargo, and UniCredit. Now, UniCredit will still continue to convert because it's a multi-year conversion, but some of those are going to start to lap as the year kind of progresses, right?\nThe other thing is, as I sit back and I just think about basic fundamentals, the point really is you've got to kind of remember that overall, the consumer remains healthy. We factored that in. The thoughts we shared for 2025 is a range which is high end of low double digits to low teens, right?\nAgain, you've got to keep that in mind. In that, we're building in assumptions around FX volatility. FX volatility picked up in Q4. You saw that come through in the exit rate you're talking about. Hard to predict what FX volatility looks like through the end of the year of 2025. We built in our best assumptions around that, but things could move around on that as well. Again, there are various factors which are actually influencing this, but that's what I'd kind of tell you more holistically as to what's going on here.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. I want to ask about stablecoins. It's likely that we get some regulatory clarity in the US this year. I know the vast majority of stablecoin usage is in crypto-native use cases and trading, but are you seeing anything in the cross-border money movement front? More importantly, Michael, I know you talked about kind of the new settlement capabilities, and you've done a lot of work on crypto over the years. How are you positioned for the growth in the crypto ecosystem? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. Thank you, Harshita. Overall, as I said in my prepared remarks, this is a space that we've been active in for a while. Your question doesn't really talk about the crypto space as crypto as an investment on-ramp, off-ramp. We've been doing this successfully. Crypto.com is clearly an exciting addition to the set of partnerships. You were really talking more about the potential of the underlying technology and what it can do.\nThe cross-border use case has been talked about for years now. Now, we've started to move beyond the proof of concept stage. Now, there are real transactions that took place, first one in Hong Kong last year. We're in the business of stablecoin transactions. We're in the business of having the MTN live. It hasn't scaled yet. That's also the reality. We have long believed that this is an interesting space for us B2B cross-border payments to get into.\nI see it as a net addition and upside opportunity for us. There's enough push now. Crypto has gone mainstream with the ETFs, and there's clearly push from the incoming administration here in the US. We'll see more momentum, and I feel we're well prepared, and our strong partnerships with players like JPMorgan and other large settlement bank players will help us on that front.\nNow, this isn't the only cross-border solution that's out there. There are real-time payments where there are initiatives to potentially connect those systems. It's important to keep in mind that we're in 12 of large RTP markets where we have a presence. That's an interesting space for us to also watch. In the end, it fundamentally comes down to choice. Where do countries want to take this?\nCountries have looked at this as in potentially connecting in bilateral fashions. We've always been an advocate to saying multilateral approaches work better. That's what we've proven on the card side. That's a topic that we engage on when it comes to RTP side of things, but also from the stablecoin side, where again, interoperability between different kinds of stablecoins also matters, which is kind of the same concept. Exciting space leaning in. For now, we're powering on with cross-border payments on the card side, which work really well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rayna Kumar from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRayna Kumar\n\nHead of Fintech Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, Michael and Sachin. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us an update on your progress in gaining market share in Europe and whether there are any particular countries that you're seeing stronger performance from?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. Europe's been a real success story for Mastercard. If I look back over the last five, six years, we've seen tremendous growth on the continent, seen tremendous growth in the UK. In the UK, we're market share leaders, credit, prepaid, and debit. It's about a third of the debit cards that are now Mastercard, large conversions. I just talked earlier about extending our partnership with Santander in the UK. That's a growth story.\nOn the continent, I'm particularly excited about the strategic partnership with UniCredit. That's 13 markets across the continent. There are not that many pan-European players. In fact, that is probably the most pan-European player there is. That's a fantastic partnership, strategic in nature. Other breakthroughs, BPER Banca in Italy, Banco BPM there, that's a large win. Big momentum. I think that's the first thing to say.\nThe second thing to say is, in these markets, it's not just about shifting shares. It's also really taking advantage of the secular opportunity that still exists in Europe. If you take some of the large developed economies, G7 economy like Italy, still significant amounts of cash to go after, and we're doing that very actively. We're doing that very actively also deploying our services in that space. Italy has historically been one of the most significant services opportunities for us.\nWith all the talk that's there about Europe, concerns about Europe, Europe's competitiveness, and Davos, this is a big theme. Really, it's important to remember that our business in Europe is in the European economy overall. We're well positioned and growing as parts of that economy, and this is tremendous for us. We've seen volumes grow in Europe at 16% levels. That's a tremendous growth rate for us. Overall, I think we're pressing every button that is there to press for us to push ahead on that growth story.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks a lot. I want to stay in Europe, if you don't mind, and ask about Mastercard 2030. I think the whole one-click payments initiative to get rid of manual card entry in Europe, to me, it feels like eliminating signature, which ushered in growth in contactless. Is that a fair analogy to think about Mastercard 2030 potentially pushing tokenization? I'm curious why Europe, why not more regions, and what makes Europe special for you to set this goal up for Mastercard? Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nTokenization in Europe, when I think of the evolution of the European payment markets from PSD1 to PSD2 to PSD3, the topic of security, the topic of consumer experience, the topic of a fair and level playing field have been themes throughout all of these regulations. This is a market, in our view, that's ripe for doing away with one-time passwords and keying in card numbers.\nI think everything that is needed to make that successful is there in Europe, and we want to prove it. It's been a strategy of ours to have reference markets and show that an initiative works, and we go where there are open arms and where we feel this is going to be successful.\nIn Europe, we now have a very relevant share position that makes us a strategic partner across markets because if you do this just in one country in Europe, then it's going to be problematic. We have the regulation. We have partnerships across the board, so that's good. Now, tokens are at the core of that, and, as I said earlier, biometrics; we have that technology deployed widely in Europe. Then we'll see where we take it from that.\nThe wider use of tokens, the wider use of tokens is this sets us up for exactly that, and we'll be looking at other use cases and see what that can do for our company overall. It's a tremendous opportunity. Of course, this is not about just Europe. You asked the question about Europe. This is a global goal. This is what we're going to go after. As I said earlier, it's a safer ecosystem that makes sense for everybody.\nIn the world where there's government interest in payments and so forth, if we're seen as a responsible party that drives overall payment ecosystem safety, that's a fantastic position for us as well. I'm sure that will be received well globally. We'll go region by region whenever we feel is the right time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. Michael, I wanted to get your view on potential impacts of the sort of new political environment. I'm just curious if you're expecting any or you're seeing any tailwinds or headwinds from policy changes. More specifically, if we do end up seeing kind of widespread tariffs applied, which we may or may not, how would that impact your business?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRamsey, this is a question that I think is top of mind in many industries. Here's how I would go about that. The new political environment, first of all, we've seen waves of political changes around the world. I think at the earlier part of last year, we were looking into 2024, and more than half of the population of the world was going to go to the polls from India to Europe, and now in November in the United States. There is a lot of change. There's a lot of volatility. There's some political uncertainty.\nWhen we sit in our boardroom and we sit in our management team and we talk about this, payments will continue regardless because we power the economy, and we power, in particular, the digital economy. That is a fundamental underlying secular trend, as we discussed at our investor day, that just keeps going on. That's the fundamental starting point in response to your question. Now, we have a new administration here in the United States.\nConfirmations haven't fully been done yet, but the Secretary of the Treasury is confirmed and so forth for some of the key partners that we would normally engage with. We have an administration coming in that is touting a business-friendly approach, and that's fundamentally good for us. The conversation around tariffs and the intended use of tariffs has been discussed. We have to see how it plays out and what will happen.\nIt's also clear we're not in the import-export industry. The way that we would be affected is really in indirect ways and how potentially some of our customers and partners get affected by that. That's something that we'll come to when we get, I think, the point that I just made before: the fundamentally underlying drive of a digitizing world. Questions like digital trade are going to be important questions.\nHow is the world dealing with digital trade and how digital trade policy will play out over the years? We have been actively engaging here in the US, in Europe, in ASEAN, and so forth. Important topic for us to continue to watch in advance because that's good for all economies around the world. Fundamentally, positive business outlook here from the US administration. We see a Europe that is now in active conversations with the second term of Ursula von der Leyen to drive a more growth-oriented approach in Europe as well, which with our position in Europe should be a good thing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Good job. I guess my question, you mentioned FX volatility briefly. It got better kind of through Q4 and quite a bit better in January. I just want to refresh on that. That helps the transaction line, right? It should help the transaction yield going forward. Should that be a nice accelerant factor to the transaction yield over the next quarter or two if it stays kind of where it is now?\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nHey, David. Yes, it's in our transaction processing assessments line. That's where it is. You got that right. Again, volatility will be what volatility will be. To the extent there's higher volatility, you get the impact come through in that line item, which impacts yields positively. To the extent it kind of goes in the opposite direction, it has a negative impact on yield. That's the line item where you'll see that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi, all. Good morning. Thank you. Wanted to ask on rebates and incentives, just how to think about the level of renewal activity here in 2025 and directionally, just any commentary you can share on how you expect R&I growth to progress versus how you finished in 2024.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard",
    "content2": "Sure. Bryan, again, I think Michael kind of talked about this a little bit earlier. We continue to compete out in the marketplace. We are winning, and we're winning the right kinds of portfolios, which is really important. We're not going to win every portfolio. We're going to hopefully win the. Yeah. We don't want to. We want to win the right kinds of portfolios, which is what we've been doing, and that's the plan going forward as well.\nFrom a renewal activity standpoint, nothing unusual to call out in 2025, as in there isn't a lumpiness in terms of renewals in 2025 versus prior years. It's kind of business as usual. Our teams are out there engaged with our customers, selling on the basis of the value we deliver across payments, but also across value-added services and solutions. That's been a key enabler to help us win on the payment side.\nSuper important for us to continue to do that. I'll tell you from an overall rebates and incentive standpoint, you can see what the metrics are for Q4. For Q1, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of payment network assessments to be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4. I'm not going to give you an outlook as it relates to the full year.\nI mean, that's really subject to what kind of deal flow and deal activity we see. The most important thing to keep in mind is, while we're all very focused on the level of rebates and incentives we pay, what we're even more focused on is driving an accretion in our net revenue yield. That is really important. That's what we'll continue to do from a strategy standpoint and an execution standpoint.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nIt comes back to the virtuous cycle between payments and services. We have to be relevant in payments. We have to be in the flow so we can apply our payment solutions and our services solutions. That is what's always in focus. There are strategic portfolios to win and less strategic portfolios to win, but important across the spectrum of different types of wins, as I talked about smaller deals earlier. The mix of all of that is always focused on the outcome of an attractive net revenue yield. That is the target in mind where we press all of them.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director and Lead Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. Just given the stronger dollar, there's been a lot of incoming questions around the hedging strategy. I just thought maybe it'd be a good opportunity to recap some of the mechanics. Understand you've talked about doing it on a net basis, a basket of roughly 30 currencies, but not hedging some of the functional currencies. Maybe you could just recap the approach, some of the mechanics, and how this all flows through to the income statement.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. No problem. Let me first define where the exposure arises from and then what the hedging strategy is. You got to think about the exposure to foreign exchange rates coming across three primary areas. One is what we call transaction exposures, which is when the transaction currency is different than the functional currency of the business unit in question.\nThe next is what we have in the nature of monetary assets and liabilities, where the currency of those monetary assets and liabilities is different than the functional currency of the business unit in question. The third is what we call translation exposure, which is the conversion of our overseas earnings into US dollars. For example, we are euro functional for the European entities.\nThose Euro earnings are ultimately translated back to US dollars when we do our as-reported numbers. There are three levels over which we get these exposures. We hedge layer number one, which is transaction exposures. We hedge them. We have a philosophy around that. We have hedge ratios, which vary by currency. They're generally in that range of, call it somewhere in that 50% to 80 range in terms of what we hedge on a net basis, net of expenses. Again, that's kind of the thinking there.\nThere are some currencies which are not necessarily hedgeable just because the market is not liquid enough, and we don't hedge those. We also don't hedge right down to the smallest currency exposure, which is there. We exercise materiality thresholds on that. On the monetary assets and liabilities, similar to transaction exposures, we hedge those as well, right?\nAgain, it's based on what the forecasts are. On the translation exposures, we do not hedge them. The reason you don't hedge them is we view our hedging strategy as being one of focused on driving the right economic outcome for the company. What we try and do is we hedge cash flow exposures, where we expect cash movements to take place. In the instance of translation, there is no real cash movement taking place from a Euro functional entity to a US dollar functional entity.\nThe cash movement takes place when dividends are made, and then we'll hedge the dividend payment at that point in time. That's kind of the philosophy as to how we go about hedging. Also remember, on translation exposures, which are not hedged, which is what I just spoke about right now, things move around, right?\nI mean, we all know that there's dollar strength in the last couple of months, and then there's euro strength or there's BRL strength, Brazilian real strength. These things tend to revert to the mean. We run the business for the fundamentals of the business in terms of driving underlying value. Currencies will do what currencies do. We hedge them on an economic basis, much like I just explained.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThe one thing I would like to add to that is we love the fact that we have a geographically diversified business. This comes with it. This is a fundamental differentiator for us. Many of these markets around the world are fast-growing markets, where that is where we find the biggest secular opportunity. The FX is the last thing that I think about. I think about the growth opportunity in those markets.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director, Payments, and FinTech Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. I wanted to go back to domestic assessments and the growth there relative to GDV and purchase volume. There's been a pretty consistent spread between those growth rates over the last few years. Then Sachin, you called out cross-border mix as a driver of that spread this quarter. If you could just unpack what that means and if we should interpret as meaning if cross-border volume is outgrowing GDV, that we'll kind of see that mix headwind persist. Thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. The first thing I'll mention in terms of the delta between what we see in domestic assessments and GDV is there's a rounding impact, which is taking place there. While you see the numbers as we've kind of talked about it as 10% and 12%, the reality is the 10 is a rounded down number, the 12 is a rounded up number. The delta isn't as big as it kind of seems out there, but kind of that's by the way, just FYI.\nOn your question around the cross-border mix component, here's the reality. By its very definition, domestic assessments does not include cross-border revenue. GDV includes cross-border volumes. What happens effectively is if cross-border volumes are growing at 20%, which is what we kind of reported for Q4, you've got the impact of that coming through in the GDV number. You have no associated revenue coming through in domestic assessments. That's what I mean by cross-border.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, I appreciate you taking the question. Michael, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on the European market, following up on the kind of mid-teens growth you've been putting up in that geography more recently. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the competitive dynamics with some of the local schemes being folded up into the European Payments Initiative, I think including in your home market of Germany. Just any thoughts about how this kind of changes the landscape and just remind us kind of conceptually how you think about the competitive dynamics on the continent? Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. That's a great question. I always love to talk about my home country. I want to put a stat into your mind. Earlier on, we talked about how we're driving payments growth by shifting volumes from domestic networks and closed-loop networks.\nOver the years, we have driven up our switching ratio to 70%. That's an important as a backdrop into this question. We have success, and we know how to deal with domestic competitors and partners. Now, on that backdrop, particularly in Europe, there has been over the years push to come up with local payment solutions as an alternative offer to consumers. There's a whole range of reasons why that is contemplated in Europe, partly sovereignty, partly more control, all of that.\nThe fundamental truth, though, is that in the end, the consumer is a really deciding factor here. What's a good user experience? How about availability? If you put a new app into a payment market that has tons of choices already, it's going to be very hard to convince merchants and consumers to change.\nWe've seen it in the US with a bank-led app as well. All in, we feel this is good for competition. It motivates us to continue to compete and invest in our proposition across channels. We talked about the token topic earlier on and how that makes checkout easier and so forth. Right now, we are looking particularly at Wero. Wero is currently an initiative of three countries. This was multi-country in previous years, and now it's down to three. The first transaction took place in December. There's proof of concept, pilot stage, and we'll see where it goes. At this point in time, we don't see it as a material concern or threat to our business. Our approach has always been one of partnership.\nWe partner with domestic schemes in many countries around the world, maybe on the services side, and we'll see how that goes over time. The more choice there is because it will generally build for a level playing field on the competition side, which we like, and then we'd love to compete with our solutions.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nDo you think we can squeeze one more question in?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our last question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the volume acceleration, Sachin. I mean, I know you mentioned a bunch of different things, but as we look underneath it all, is it that the consumer's really gaining strength, and that's sort of what's driving the acceleration? Is it part of its share gains? I'm just trying to think about the acceleration in the Q4, the sustained one in actually a further acceleration in the United States year to date. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about that. Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure, Sanjay. I'll speak to the fact that the metrics you're talking about for the Q4 compared to the Q3 acceleration you're kind of alluding to. I think at the highest level, we should all kind of take comfort in the fact that the consumer continues to be very healthy, and we're seeing strong consumer spending and good commercial spending as well. Those are important.\nAs it relates to whether it's driven by share or not driven by share, frankly, quarter to quarter, there is very minimal impact, which is there from a share standpoint because the wins which we've talked about have been helping our volume growth in the Q3 as they have in the Q4. It's really the underlying strength of the consumer and commercial spend, which is helping us.\nThere's a little bit of lift, which is coming from crypto, which we kind of talked about, right, which is there. There's a little bit in the nature of the travel spend pull forward kind of, which I spoke about in my prepared remarks. Other than that, I got to tell you, I mean, look, I mean, when you do the right things in the market, you win the right portfolios, and those portfolios grow at a good pace, and there's a healthy consumer, you tend to see the kind of metrics you see, which is what we're kind of showing you right now.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Sachin. Michael, any closing remarks?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nWell, I'm happy we got Sanjay in, even though we're over time. Excellent. Good conversation. Thank you very much for your support, as always. There was a lot going on this quarter, so it was good to overrun a little bit. I still want to do what I always do, is thank the 34,000 colleagues at Mastercard for being out there with our customers every day and pushing this business forward. Thank you to all of you for your support. We'll speak to you next quarter. Thank you very much.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Q2 2024 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer, and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, Mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.\nOur comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance.\nActual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. To headline this quarter, we delivered very strong results powered by broad-based momentum across all aspects of our business. Q2 net revenues were up 13% and adjusted net income up 24% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. These results were underpinned by healthy consumer spending, including strong cross-border volume growth of 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Value-added services and solutions net revenue grew 19% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. The macroeconomic environment remains mixed, and we continue to monitor the positives and negatives.\nA few to note: strength in consumer spending continues to be supported by a solid labor market and wage growth. While there are some signs of labor market growth moderating, this is off very strong levels of job creation. As in, also, inflation and interest rates remain in focus. We've seen inflation cool, but to varying degrees across carded and non-carded categories. Price levels are still elevated for many goods and services. Interest rates also remain elevated, but many central banks have started to ease, and economic indicators support broader rate reductions.\nWhile tailwinds and headwinds to economic growth remain, on balance, we remain positive about our growth outlook. With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities, which fuel our growth algorithm across core payments, new payment flows, and services. You may remember that we recently announced organizational changes to further increase our focus on these priorities. They included the realignment of both regional operations and payments and services to support our growth algorithm. These changes were designed to accelerate growth and unlock capacity to invest in long-term business opportunities.\nThis also helps us continue to deliver positive operating leverage over the long term. For example, we plan to redeploy resources into growth markets with high cash levels. We will invest in opening acceptance in new verticals, and we will continue to apply technology to help us realize even more of the shift to digital across both consumer and commercial. We will also enhance and expand our value-added services, such as in data analytics, fraud, and cybersecurity, particularly as we further embed AI into our products and services.\nAs a result of this organizational realignment, which positions us well for the long-term growth, we expect to incur a one-time restructuring charge in Q3. Now, moving on to an update on some specific elements of our growth algorithm. In payments, we're driving growth by winning and retaining deals, and we're tapping into the vast secular shift opportunity by expanding in new geographies and further digitizing the payments ecosystem. Let's start with our continued deal momentum.\nI'm happy to announce that Varo Bank will convert their debit and credit portfolios to Mastercard. They were the first all-digital bank to receive a national charter in the United States. Varo chose Mastercard due to our differentiated data insights, merchant-funded offers platform, and our ability to seamlessly integrate into their technology stack. We extended our enterprise agreement with Wells Fargo and partnered to launch the Attune World Elite Mastercard. This is our first proprietary consumer credit program with the bank. We also want to renew deals this quarter with key US prepaid partners, including Ouro, H&R Block, Blackhawk Network, Rellevate, and Dash Solutions.\nIn aggregate, these partnerships will drive meaningful increase in our US prepaid market share. In Canada, we extended our long-standing partnership with the National Bank of Canada across consumer credit, commercial, and prepaid for the next decade. Postepay, who already issues millions of Mastercard cards in Italy, has expanded our collaboration to drive additional growth across debit and prepaid. Let's deep dive into a few specific verticals and geographies. Travel is, of course, a key focus. It has strong growth potential and a meaningful cross-border component. Travel is also a natural fit with our virtual card technology and our marketing, loyalty, and consulting capabilities. We executed several new travel partnerships this quarter.\nWe signed a deal with global digital payments provider Checkout.com to enable them to deploy their virtual card issuing solution to their online travel agency customers. We also announced a multi-year agreement with Wells Fargo and Expedia to launch two new co-brand cards with a range of unique travel benefits. We executed a new co-brand deal with Dashen Bank and Ethiopian Airlines, the largest airline in Africa. This builds on a co-brand deal with RwandAir and I&M RwandAir that we initiated earlier this year. I'm sure it wasn't lost on you that these two last deals I mentioned are in Africa. The continent is a great example of the vast secular opportunity in emerging markets.\nExternal sources estimate that approximately 90% of transactions in Africa are made in cash. We are committed to the digital transformation of the regions, and we're doing so by ramping up our investments, developing new partnerships, and rapidly expanding our acceptance footprint. For example, Africa is the world's largest adopter of mobile money accounts. Our partnerships with large telcos and mobile network operators like Airtel, MTN, Vodafone Egypt, and others put us in a great position to accelerate inclusion and cash conversion. On the acceptance front, we've more than tripled the number of acceptance locations in Africa over the last five years.\nWe recently signed deals with the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the largest bank in the country, and I&M Bank in Kenya. These partnerships will enable us to increase share in both markets. In Nigeria and Ghana, we partner with Boost, who will work with fintechs across the region to issue Mastercard cards. Also, our Mastercard Move capabilities are the foundation for a new cross-border money movement solution with Access Bank Group. Together, we're enabling businesses and consumers in several African markets to send and receive international payments across over 140 countries. Now, this secular opportunity is not limited to Africa.\nWe see opportunities around the globe. Think about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Fully capitalizing on that secular trend requires that we continue to innovate to support the digital economy at scale. We're doing just that We're enhancing the checkout experience and expanding our Tap on Phone acceptance capabilities. We're scaling our contactless technology in areas like transit, and we are driving the ongoing conversion of Maestro to Debit Mastercard. Let's dig into one: online shopping. It must be simple, and it must work on all devices and all channels. That's why we're leaning into a new area of one-click payments.\nWe announced that we will phase out manual card entry for e-commerce payments in Europe by 2030 in favor of a one-click checkout button. There are three foundational components to this effort, all anchored on driving simplicity and security. First, tokenization. Tokenization replaces payment credentials with a digitally secure token. When deployed, fraud rates decrease and approval rates improve. Since launching a decade ago, the technology has been broadly adopted around the world. In fact, we surpassed 22 billion tokenized transactions in H1 2024, up 49% versus a year ago. Second is Click to Pay.\nClick to Pay simplifies online guest checkout by eliminating the need to manually enter payment credentials. Guest checkout becomes as easy as remembering your email address. It also makes checkout more secure using the token technology I just mentioned. We are working with our merchants and bank partners to drive adoption. Click to Pay transactions more than doubled year-over-year in H1 2024. And third, our Payment Passkeys. Payment Passkeys eliminate the need for passwords or text for one-time passcodes. They allow consumers to authenticate online purchases using a fingerprint or facial features that you use every day when opening your phone.\nWhen combined, these powerful technologies are enabling us to deliver on our promise of a simple and secure one-click online checkout experience for consumers. We also continue to enhance in-store checkout. For example, we are scaling our biometric checkout program to new regions. In Europe, we're partnering with Polish fintech PayEye to allow shoppers to pay with a simple glance. In Latin America, we are working with Ingenico so that consumers at participating supermarkets can pay with a wave. We're also working at pace to migrate Maestro cards to Debit Mastercard outside the United States.\nShifting to Debit Mastercard is a critical element of our strategy as we see a 2x spend lift on cards once they are migrated. This is primarily due to the ability to capture both cross-border and online spend on Debit Mastercard. In H1 2024, we converted over 14 million cards, which brings us to almost 300 million cards migrated since 2016. These innovations are examples of the investments we are making to differentiate the Mastercard experience versus other payment methods like P2P, or local payment schemes. We also continue to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new payment flows. Today, I will focus on commercial, starting with accounts payable payments.\nWe are operating from a position of strength. Our market-leading virtual card capabilities have been deployed with over 90 issuers worldwide. Additionally, we are integrating our technology into four of the top five leading global procure-to-pay solution providers. We completed the integration of our virtual card technology into Oracle Cloud ERP and commenced invoice payments for the first HSBC corporate customer in ops. On the supplier side, we signed several acquirers onto Mastercard Receivables Manager. This includes Elavon, whose customers are using our AI-powered platform to streamline the process of accepting virtual cards.\nWe also continue to expand distribution of our virtual cards, signing new deals with Brex and Ant Group's WorldFirst. On commercial point of sale, we're increasing the distribution of our commercial card products worldwide. In the US, the Wells Fargo small business credit card portfolio migration is now complete. In Europe, we've extended our partnership with Virgin Money to continue growing our small business portfolio.\nAnd our partnership with SAP Concur, which automatically integrates our corporate card data into Concur Expense, is yielding results. Large insurer SCOR SE awarded their T&E card program to Mastercard based on the value delivered through this joint offering. And finally, we're executing against our strategy to penetrate new B2B verticals. This quarter, we signed an exclusive partnership with Latin America, with CBC, the largest Pepsi distributor in the region, and the fintech enabler Yalo Tech and Migo.\nThis partnership will provide card distribution, acceptance, and financial education to almost 2 million retailers. These small businesses can now use their Mastercard small business cards to purchase inventory and other items. In the healthcare space, we signed an exclusive partnership with the Medical Tourism Association. They will now accept cards from consumers and utilize virtual cards to make cross-border payments to medical providers. Separately, we're working with Square to broaden card acceptance among smaller healthcare providers in the UK. Now turning to services. Payments support our services and vice versa.\nServices played an important part in winning many of the deals I just mentioned. The strong payments drivers helped fuel services growth. That, coupled with strong demand, drove 19% value-added services and solution net revenue growth in Q2 on a year-over-year currency-neutral basis. This is our powerful flywheel turning. I'm excited about our momentum and the future potential, whether it's deepening penetration of existing customers, launching new capabilities, or distributing our services in new ways and across new customer and transaction types. A few examples.\nFirst, our services help to improve Mastercard issuer portfolio performance, thereby supporting our customers' core business objectives. For example, SEB in the Baltics is building their customer loyalty strategy together with Mastercard. And Revolut is working with us to develop and execute their marketing strategy, launching campaigns across the UK, Ireland, and Italy. We're also deploying our services across non-FIs, helping to diversify our business and capture a new set of growth opportunities.\nCustomers as varied as Paramount and McDonald's in Taiwan are using our test-and-learn capabilities to address core business needs, including media measurement and new product introductions. We're working with LATAM Airlines in Brazil to optimize their co-brand portfolio and develop innovative marketing campaigns. We're partnering to distribute our capabilities in new and more efficient ways. Salesforce has integrated our dispute resolution services into its Financial Services Cloud. This enabled banks and other financial institutions to handle disputes and prevent chargebacks more effectively.\nKPMG Norway has partnered with the Norwegian government to distribute our RiskRecon capabilities. The solution will help hundreds of local governments evaluate their cyber risk posture and that of their suppliers. Turning to open banking, we continue to make strong progress in scaling new use cases. I'll use our account opening and account linking use case as an example. Klarna in the US is now using Mastercard's open banking for this purpose. PayPal will leverage account linking, balance check, and transaction history for their wallet in the US. Jack Henry will distribute these capabilities to streamline the account opening process for hundreds of issuers they support.\nWith that, I'll wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We're driving growth by winning and retaining deals. We're penetrating the substantial secular opportunity. We continue to see strong demand for our services. Now, our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model, and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead of us. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to page three, which shows our financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items, and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 13%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our Value-Added Services and Solutions. Operating expenses increased 10%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Operating income was up 15%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions.\nNet income and EPS increased 24% and 27%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a lower tax rate in the current quarter compared to Q2 2023, primarily due to a sizable discrete tax expense in the prior year, as well as a change in the geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $3.59, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $820 million through 26 July 2024. So let's turn to page four, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the second quarter on a local currency basis.\nWorldwide, gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 9% year over year. In the US, GDV increased by 6%, with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 7%. Debit growth was aided by the conversion of a previously announced debit win in the US. Outside of the US, volume increased 11%, with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 11%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 17% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. Turning to page five, switch transactions grew 11% year over year in Q2. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong.\nCard-present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents approximately 69% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 7%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Turning to slide six for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the second quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 9%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives, which were lower than anticipated, primarily due to the timing of planned deal activity.\nValue-added services and solutions net revenue increased 19%, primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers, strong demand for our consulting, data analytics, and marketing services, and the scaling of our fraud and security, and our identity and authentication solutions. Now, let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 9%, primarily due to mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 17%.\nThe 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by mix and pricing. Transaction processing assessments were up 13%, while switch transactions grew 11%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to mix and pricing. Other network assessments were $244 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions.\nThe growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, as well as an increase in indirect taxes as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. This was partially offset by the timing of advertising and marketing spend within the year. Turning to page nine, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the second quarter and then through the first four weeks of July. As a reminder, our Q1 switch metrics include the impact of the leap year in 2024, which added just over one percentage point to growth across each of switch volumes, switch transactions, and cross-border volumes.\nIn addition, our switch metrics in Q1 and April were impacted by the timing of Easter, which occurred at the end of Q1 this year as compared to in April in 2023. After adjusting for the leap year, the timing of Easter, and excluding the benefit from the US debit portfolio win I previously discussed, our switch metrics in Q2 were generally stable sequentially in the US and across the globe. Looking at the first four weeks of July, trends remain generally stable versus Q2. Turning to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year.\nAs Michael said, there are a number of economic headwinds and tailwinds that we are monitoring, and we remain focused on executing on our strategy. Business fundamentals remain strong, as evidenced by the results we delivered this quarter across all aspects of our business. Our diversified business model, underpinned by healthy consumer spending, the continued secular shift to digital forms of payment, and strong demand for our Value-Added Services and Solutions continues to position us well for the opportunities ahead. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook.\nNow turning to Q3 2024, year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while we expect a 1 to 2 ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 operating expense growth to be at the low double-digit range versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items.\nWe expect higher growth in advertising and marketing in Q3 compared to the first half of the year, primarily driven by the cadence of spend related to our sponsorship activities. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this OpEx growth for the quarter, while we expect a 0 to 1 ppt tailwind from foreign exchange. Separately, as Michael mentioned, as part of our recent reorganization, we expect to record a one-time restructuring charge in Q3 of approximately $190 million. This will be recorded as a special item and excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.\nWe expect these actions will free up capacity to further invest in our strategic priorities as we continue to execute on our growth algorithm. We also expect they will contribute to delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. As it relates to the full year 2024, we expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double-digits range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year, and foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year.\nIn terms of operating expenses, our expectations for the full year are to grow at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth for the year. Other items to keep in mind. On other income and expenses, in Q3, we expect an expense of approximately $100 million. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.\nFinally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 17% and 18% for Q3 and 17% to 17.5% on a full-year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. One last point. I wanted to let you know that we are planning to host an Investor Day in New York on 13 November. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relation, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Sachin. Julie Ann, please open the call for questions now.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please only press star one once to queue up for questions, as pressing star one multiple times may affect your position in the queue. Pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Michael, can you talk about US merchant litigation, the settlement rejection, and the path forward from here? How should we think about the range of outcomes? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. Thanks, Harshita. You're not asking about the secular opportunity, I'm noticing. So the merchant settlement. So the first thing I would say is we're disappointed where this has landed for now. I would describe it as we respectfully disagree with the court's ruling to reject the settlement. This has been negotiated over many years across many parties, I think with best intentions, and it would have produced a lot of benefit for consumers, for merchants, and across all parties. So this is now not happening. We are obviously ready, and we will take all efforts to ensure that a solution is found before this goes to trial, engage all parties.\nWe've done this in previous scenarios before. It's difficult to speculate about outcomes at this point, but I think this intention to lean in and see how we can provide more security, predictability to merchants and to banks and all parties here is what's driving us. So there's a number of co-defendants in this, and everybody will obviously take their own decisions here. But across the board, obviously, there has to be a dialogue on to find the best outcome of this.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. Yeah, I wanted to ask on rebates and incentives growth. I think that came in a little bit better than you guys had been expecting for Q2. Sachin, if you could just unpack some of the upside there relative to expectations, and then any help for what you're expecting for R&I growth over the next couple of quarters. Thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure, Trevor. So you're right. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our rebates and incentives did come in slightly lower than our expectations for the second quarter. I just want to kind of take it up a level just to kind of remind everybody. We're very active in the markets. We are constantly looking at what opportunities exist with existing customers and then with who could be potential new customers. And we have a view on what our pipeline of activities is. So the vast majority of what we had in the nature of better, or I would say, lower rebates and incentives in the second quarter were driven by some of that deal activity not materializing in the second quarter.\nStill remains in the pipeline. It's still something we expect will occur as the year progresses. And then more specifically, as it relates to Q3, we expect that our rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments will be higher than it was in Q2. And it's essentially based on exactly what I just said, which is it's a very rich deal pipeline that we have. And again, this is more of a timing issue than anything else.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThat comes back to the point. In the end, we want to be in a transactional flow. We want to be relevant to our customers. We want to be relevant in the eyes of the consumers that they have a Mastercard product in their hand. And we fight for the deals that we find strategically relevant, that also meet our financial criteria. In the end, it all has to add up in combination between payments and services, that our net revenue yield develops positively, and that we keep in focus.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nThanks. Good morning. Can we just spend a second on the realignment or the organization a little bit? I know you talk about it to create capacity and drive incremental growth. I think the question I have is, how should we think about that and driving kind of new constituencies as you talk about new verticals and maybe expansion of data analytics? And then more specifically, how does that open up the aperture of the network as we think about that going forward? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, Dan. So as I said earlier, the idea here is to accelerate growth. The idea is not to reposition our strategy. We've articulated our strategy. You'll hear more of that in the investor community meeting in November and how we see that play out in more detail across our core payment solutions, new flows, and the services portfolio. I purposefully stayed at the point on markets with high cash penetration. So here is, as I laid out in the context of Africa, but there's more in other emerging markets around the world. There's a tremendous opportunity here. So we want to strengthen our front line.\nBut it's also clear that the recipe to participate in the secular opportunity emerging markets isn't the same as in developed markets. So we're investing in product and so forth. It's pretty clear that on the services side, as far as the areas of focus are concerned, we continue to be guided by underlying strong secular trends. And one of that is for really any of our corporate partners and B2B partners that they want to make sense of their enterprise data and make better decisions.\nAnd how do we do that? We do that by leveraging our artificial intelligence solution, a set of assistants, a set of fine-tuning, how they could have more personalized suggestions to their end consumers, etc., etc. That's one part. Help our customers make better decisions, not changing, but very specific solutions with a higher weightage to AI. Then on the security side and the cybersecurity side, all of this data has to be kept safe. We kept saying that for years. That's a strong secular trend in itself. Making sure that we fine-tune our solutions here. We got to move faster because the bad guys are also moving faster, and they have the similar technology tools at their hand now.\nSo leveraging artificial intelligence, an example I gave last quarter around Decision Intelligence Pro that's predicting what is the next card that might be defrauded before it actually happens. Those kind of solutions provide significant lifts to our customers in terms of preventing fraud, obviously giving peace of mind to their consumers, and overall helping our business. It's a close link to our underlying payments business. So all of that, it's largely the same strategy, but we're really focusing on very specific aspects of that. And there are other aspects of our portfolio that we're going to dial down as a result of this effort.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you. Good morning, Michael and Sachin. Europe continues to be your largest geo by GDV, and also highly differentiated growth there continues. Would appreciate your look forward on cash digitization opportunity, thoughts on the consumer, and then the outlook also for cross-border travel in and out of Europe.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So let me start. I want to anchor on how you framed your question. It's been a strong growth story for us in Europe. That's continental Europe as well as the UK. We've seen tremendous share growth there. That's really focusing down and investing more locally in Europe, have a better presence there, engage with national governments as well as with European institutions. We feel very European in Europe. That's the first thing I would say. When we come back to the times of COVID, there was a large set of economies in Europe that were lagging, I would argue, on the digitization front.\nChanging behaviors in consumers have increased the pressure to digitize further, and that has happened. So we've seen Europe catch up, and it obviously shows in our numbers. But back to the point of secular opportunity we just discussed. If you look at the economies in Germany and Italy, there's significant cash in the higher double digits that we're seeing there that we can go after and we will continue to go after. So I continue to expect a growth opportunity there.\nBut it's also true that there are markets that are so highly digitized today that the secular opportunity in itself is something that from cash to check isn't really happening. And there you come to the point about what are the emerging business models in a highly digitized world. The Nordics is a good example of that. There's a whole new set of business models coming up, and we're supporting those fintechs, which is why Europe is one of the geographies around the world where we have a tremendous position in fintech and other market leaders in those partnerships. So I'm excited about the Europe outlook, and we continue to invest there. Bottom line.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nDavid, on your question around cross-border in and out of Europe, a couple of thoughts around there. Look, I mean, globally, I would say we're well positioned from a cross-border standpoint. You could see that in our metrics. Then, as it relates to Europe, back to what Michael just said, as we've been winning portfolios, there's been a mix of portfolios we've been there, some of which are high cross-border, and others are lower from a cross-border standpoint.\nThe idea is to actually be in the flow, participate, and create opportunities for yourself to actually leverage our services, our loyalty assets, in order to drive cross-border, whether it's Europe or anywhere else in the world. The last point I'll make is sensitivity to foreign exchange rates, right? Strong dollar certainly helps in terms of the inbound into Europe because you tend to see a lot more travelers from the US actually show up in Europe as part of that process. So again, we feel good about the cross-border opportunity, not only in and out of Europe, but globally for the company.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. And one last point to add based on the financial frame that Sachin just put around it, back to the R&I question. So in Europe, we really feel we are well positioned in the markets from a share perspective. So this aspect of financial discipline as we continue to look for deals and partnerships in Europe really rises to the top.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. It's good to see the stability into July in the US volume side. So if you could just help us understand a little more on the key difference, if there's anything from CrowdStrike or weather, and then I guess really Michael also, more importantly, just the ability for you guys to win these portfolios. If you could help us just remind us, understanding what the driving factors are, how much of it is, if there's any competitive pricing dynamics, how much of it might be just VAS, and maybe a little bit more of what you see ahead.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah. Why don't I take the first part of that question, Darren? In terms of the trends we've seen for the first four weeks of July, it's like I said, look, I mean, general stability and drivers across the board. And you can see that on page nine of our presentation. And really, I mean, to your question as to whether there was an impact from the events over with CrowdStrike or weather, I mean, the reality is the weather piece had a little bit of an impact. That's what I would actually mention. But it's kind of muted in terms of the context of you've got now four weeks' worth of data in there. And so the reality is these things kind of happen.\nThere comes a particular week, if you look at it, it might look lower or higher, and then there might be a catch-up factor which takes place as weeks kind of follow. By and large, we feel good about what we're seeing from a consumer spending standpoint, and that's reflective of what you see on the metrics right here.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. In the second part of your question, the other market in the US, and same as Europe since we just talked about that, remains incredibly competitive. I think we haven't seen such elevated level of competition and payments that we're currently seeing. You see a lot of movements in the market. There's banks looking at network opportunities and so forth. So there's a lot going on. But it's also true that for us, we continue to broaden our payment solutions and our service offerings. And really, that comes to that part of your question, which is what matters here. What matters here is that we can help our customers run their business in a better way.\nSo what are they trying to do? And are solutions helping? Data insights, cybersecurity certainly matter. The fact that cards isn't the best answer to all payments, but there is also a multi-rail set of solutions that customers are looking for. We have all of that. That puts us in a differentiated position. We're trying not to sell product, but really come in with solutions through our sales force. That's working for us, but it's pretty clear. We have to be financially competitive. That always matters. If you can have a conversation around the top-line outcome with your customer vis-à-vis the cost of payments, that changes the dialogue quite significantly.\nWhen I talk to CEOs and the customer side, that's what they're really interested in. That's working. That's a lot of value that we bring, and we price for that. We continue to price for that. You've heard us mention pricing changes in the last quarter. So we do that wherever we see the opportunity. Tokenization is a great example. We've invested in tokenization, and we needed to scale it up.\nNow we have an opportunity to build a whole set of services on top of the basic token that we can price for and that we feel we should price for because they drive a better outcome in terms of better approval rates, lower fraud, and so forth for our customers. So I think we're well positioned in a very competitive market, and we're going to continue to try to keep that edge.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thank you. And I guess my question on the cross-border line, you've had a very nice positive divergence between constant currency revenues and constant currency volumes. This quarter was about 4%. I think for 13 quarters in a row, it's been nicely positive. In prior years, it was pretty close to neutral, sometimes even a little negative. Why does that continue to be positive? And how should we think of that going forward? Is that going to stay that nice positive divergence?\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, David. So look, I mean, it's like I said, right? It's being driven by favorable mix and a little bit of pricing in the second quarter. The reality is the mix piece is really what's been actually causing that positive divergence you're talking about. As you're aware, our cross-border volumes are, and we show you the metrics on this. We have intra-Europe cross-border, and then we have other cross-border. Intra-Europe is lower yielding. Other cross-border is high yielding for us.\nAnd so as you think about this, if the other cross-border volumes are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe, you tend to see that positive divergence. I'll remind you, during COVID, we actually had the reverse phenomena take place. We had intra-Europe growing faster than other cross-border, and you actually had the reverse happening, which is you had cross-border assessments growing at a slower clip than the actual underlying driver growth. So that's really what we mean by mix there. And then, of course, there's pricing, which we do back to the point Michael was making around the value we deliver, which is another contributing factor in the second quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nI was wondering, Sachin, could you just talk about the share gain benefits in the quarter and maybe what's on the horizon? I think you mentioned it in the context of incentives. And then just specific to some of the revenue items or revenue lines, when I look at domestic assessment revenue, that kind of slowed from a trend line that we've seen that was much stronger. I know some of it was FX, but was there anything else similar for other revenues? Those were down a little bit. I know it's a smaller line, but any callouts there?\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSo I'll take, I think, those three questions there. So I'm going to take all three of them, which is on domestic assessments. The delta you're seeing in terms of domestic assessments growing at 7% compared to GDV growing at 9% has primarily been driven by mix. I need to remind everybody that GDV and domestic assessments is not a perfect proxy, just because in domestic assessments, there's a whole bunch of other stuff which is there. You've got card fees. You've got a bunch of stuff going on in there. So there's always going to be some level of kind of difference in terms of growth rates there.\nBut what we like to call out is what are the salient features or factors which are causing for the different growth rates between domestic assessments and GDV growth. And when I talk about mix there, just so that you're clear, I mean, the mix could come from a whole host of things. So for example, our GDV includes our cross-border volumes. Our domestic assessments do not include our cross-border related revenues. And so what you've got is with GDV growing, you don't have the associated cross-border revenue which is there, which would come in terms of the domestic assessments. You could also have changes in geographic mix.\nYou've got high-yielding and low-yielding regions. And depending on the growth rate of regions, you might see deltas come to the positive or the negative there. So that, Sanjay, is the domestic assessments piece. On the other payment network revenues, again, look, I mean, this is not something which we are necessarily focused on as a business. That is, it's one of the things which is required to run the network. It's a range of things from licensing fees, implementation fees, franchise fees, and things of that sort. And those things move around.\nSo I wouldn't get too fussed about the fact that in one quarter, it grows at an exceptional pace, and the next quarter, it's actually going the opposite direction, just because, first, the number is fairly small, and second, there are a whole host of reasons why that might happen. For example, as customers get more compliant, you might have lessened the nature of compliance fees that you're charging them. So that's a good thing for the network, by the way, over the long term. And then the last point you asked, actually, it was the first question you asked, which was around share gain benefits in the quarter.\nThe one I called out really was around the debit conversion in the US. And we have previously announced this. We have announced our win of the debit portfolio from Citizens. We are super pleased with our relationship with Citizens. That conversion is going exceptionally well. That conversion, for the most part, was complete in the second quarter. So we had new cards which were sent out to customers.\nSo there's a little bit of that which is there. Again, but what I wanted to share was that when we're looking at drivers, right, between Q2 and the first four weeks of July, or for that matter, between Q1 and Q2, when you take out the impact of these share wins, there's still underlying stability in terms of consumer spending trends. On share gains, just so that you've got the overall picture, right? So we've talked a little bit about Citizens. We had the Webster win. You've got a whole bunch of stuff which will roll on, and those will be multi-year kind of conversions which will come through. In particular, I'd call out UniCredit.\nSo in UniCredit, we had announced this deal win in 2023. Well, that conversion's underway. That'll be over a multi-year kind of timeframe again. Deutsche Bank, again, the conversion's underway. It'll take a couple of years before you actually start to see the completion of that occur. So all of these things will play out over time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good results here. Just on the value-added services and solutions that accelerated, I know there's an easy comp from the first quarter, but any interesting trends in terms of composition of growth within VAS and any callouts for the second half of the year in terms of VAS growth?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. Tien-tsin, good to hear you. 19% is a strong growth rate for sure. The usual suspect in terms of driving for growth is the payments-related part of this, particularly on the cybersecurity side. So that continues to grow and grow very well. So there's more need for more fraud solutions. That's one thing. And on the data analytics side, we continue to see great interest, as I laid out in remarks: test and learn, for example. So I'll give you a number of examples how customers are trying to figure out what kind of campaigns make sense, how can they serve their customers better, and so forth. So no particular change there.\nI think the fundamental trend that I touched on earlier, in an earlier response, more infusion of AI across the board to make these products scale better and be more effective; that's certainly a trend. Overall, the whole mix of this is largely unchanged. We continue to invest in newer aspects of our services portfolio, particularly on the open banking side. I talked through a couple of use cases here. They still have to scale up in a significant way, but we feel we're well positioned in Europe, Australia, and the US on the open banking side. So good to see.\nWe said in the first quarter where we had a slightly lower growth rate, we're going to be higher quarter every single quarter for the rest of this year, and that is playing out as predicted. So occasionally, you have tougher comps and so forth, but this is a pretty solid trend for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDan Dolev\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nOh, hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Last quarter, I believe you gave us a cadence on rebates and incentives growing slower in the second half versus the first half. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color onto the cadence of rebates and incentives this year and great results again? Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah. Hey, Dan. Dan, last quarter, I shared with you a point of view around what we thought rebates and incentives would look like in the second quarter. What we had said is it would be flat to slightly lower for the second quarter. In the second quarter, rebates and incentives came in lower than the first quarter, lower than even what we had expected, for the reasons which I mentioned earlier, which is the timing of deal activity. Then today, I shared with you what I think will be rebates and incentives in Q3, which we expect that rebates and incentives as a percentage of payment network assessments will be higher in Q3 compared to Q2.\nWe really haven't shared much in the nature of rebates and incentives beyond that. So really, just for clarification, that's what I wanted to share with you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nAnalyst, William Blair",
    "content2": "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Michael, I wanted to ask about open banking and particularly in the US. I've been hearing some conflicting things about the price of real-time payments, interchange in real-time payments, I guess, versus debit, especially Durbin regulated debit, and perhaps the enthusiasm on consumers' behalf to pay from their bank accounts, but maybe some chargeback and customer service dispute issues that banks are facing. I just wonder if you could maybe parse some of the puts and takes and give an outlook on the future of open banking, particularly in the US.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So, interesting you call that out. I just mentioned that just before. And I said it's not quite where I think most market participants would have wished open banking got to over the years. And that applies, I think, globally. Here in the United States, when I look at open banking with a focus on particular services, a set of actions around account opening, or account linking, or data aggregation, or things like that, we see good momentum. I talked about that earlier. When it comes to payments, the payment side of open banking, it's still true that the value that the card ecosystem brings is significant. And you made a point on chargebacks.\nThat is not comfortable if there's a problem and then there's no established way to get your money back. On cards, we do that. The same is for fraud protection. I think we know exactly how that works in the world of card payments. It's not so clear yet in the world of account-to-account payments. Nevertheless, it is our role as an ecosystem custodian to understand where emerging technologies are going. Where is customer interest going? That consumers want to use their data footprint to get better services? Well, absolutely. First of all, that starts with data protection and data consent management, which we invest a lot of energy on.\nBut then to say, \"All right, how could this kind of technology be used?\" So we do invest in it, which is why we called out Open Banking as an element of kind of a future-oriented activity for us and investment. What we currently see are those use cases that I mentioned. They are the most near-term opportunity. And this is around lending. It's around account opening, account linking, asset verification, and more recently around data aggregation. Our Smart Subscription solution is one example of that.\nThat works really well for consumers. If you got 15 subscriptions and you see them in one place, then it makes a real difference. So I think it's evolving. It's evolving, and we're at the forefront of evolving it, but we're also trying to make sure that it's understood that the value we bring through cards is really unparalleled.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Fahed Kunwar from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFahed Kunwar\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi, both. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about profitability. Obviously, there's a lot of various moving parts with B2B growing really nicely cross-border. How do you think about margin expansion, though, versus kind of investing in all of these various product areas in distribution and the products themselves? Should we expect margins to carry on expanding as they have been, or will there be continued areas of investment that you think will kind of drive expenses higher from here? Thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nHi, Fahed. So a couple of thoughts here for you, which is number one. I think we mentioned in the past, and this philosophy of ours remains unchanged, which is we aspire to deliver positive operating leverage, which is driving net revenue growth at a faster clip than operating expense growth over the long term. So that's really what the aspiration is for how we're running the business. The most important thing to remember is we're running the business for top-line growth and bottom-line growth. And in order to do that, we keep a very close eye on making investments to drive growth in the near term, medium term, and long term.\nSo yes, we are investing in things which will drive growth in the near, medium, and long term. That is super essential from our perspective, not only because that's what our shareholders desire, but also because we believe the set of opportunities in front of us are sizable. And so for us to leave those opportunities underinvested would be a bad move for the long-term health of our company. So we will continue to invest in the business. We will do that with the strategic priorities which Michael has laid out with that focus.\nWe will constantly look at those priorities to see how the market conditions are evolving, and we will pivot as necessary. But the general kind of flow is, yes, we will continue to invest in the growth of our business because we see tremendous opportunity on a going-forward basis. Very good.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Paul Golding from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPaul Golding\n\nAnalyst, Macquarie Capital\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about AI in a fraud sense. I know that you're incorporating AI into your products and presumably as part of VAS to combat fraud. Just wanted to ask what you're seeing in terms of the offensive of fraud using AI and how that might accelerate the adoption of your new products and your investment in new products around AI to combat that. Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So with rapid digitization around the world, we've seen a lot of new entrants into the ecosystem. A lot of small businesses have digitized post-COVID. As you see in emerging markets, a lot of people for the first time using digital solutions. So digitization is growing. Vulnerabilities are growing. And technology in the hands of fraudsters is also evolving. This makes for an environment where players like ourselves who oversee an ecosystem, a franchise between banks and merchants, and for the benefit of the end consumer, need to really invest in safety and security. We've done that. AI isn't actually anything new for us.\nFor the better part of a decade, we've been using AI, this discrete machine learning technology, to really predict where is the next problem and analyze data that we have and data that our customers have to prevent fraud. That's been very successful. As far as generative AI is concerned, evolving technology here, there is obviously an opportunity for us to understand more data in a quicker way. We have used that initially to train our AI models, our discriminative AI models using generative AI to create artificial data sets. That was the first step. And then we went into putting out a new set of products. I mentioned Decision Intelligence Pro.\nDecision Intelligence is a product that we've had for a long time, machine learning-driven, that was predicting fraud outcomes. And now we're using more data sets that are externally available, stolen card data, and so forth, to understand where fraud vulnerabilities might be. The lift is tremendous. We see 20% in terms of effectiveness out of that product. So we start to see demand for the whole reason of the vulnerabilities that I talked about. So we expect continued growth. We also expect the fraudsters to come up with new techniques themselves. We need to continue to evolve.\nSo I believe that the penetration of generative AI and our fraud and cybersecurity product set will only expand. Now, I talked a lot about transaction-related fraud. The vectors around cybersecurity are obviously much broader. It's prediction of fraud. It is what's the general cybersecurity posture of a company, RiskRecon capabilities, and so forth. We try to cover the whole ecosystem and become a true strategic partner of our customers. So if anything, this whole space is going to grow further, and you're going to continue to see us invest in that area.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relation, Mastercard\n\nWe have time for one more question, Julie Ann.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, Michael. Hey, Sachin. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to double-click on macro viewpoint. If I hear the message correctly, it sounds like macro remains mixed, but consumer spend trends are stable for the most part. If you could just double-click on that and let us know if there's any divergence among different consumer demographics and correspondingly what that might mean for debit versus credit, transaction sizes, anything like that, that'd be super helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So at the outset of my prepared remarks, I talked about the puts and takes on inflation, on prices. The bottom line there is that for now, the consumer is supported, and that's pretty much irrelevant of income cohort. It's supported by a strong labor market. So that's fundamentally true, and it's fundamentally true around the world. But it's in aggregate, but it's not a uniform answer. The picture obviously plays out very differently, country by country. We have a very global business. So we look at what is the central bank of Japan doing, and we saw that today. They raised rates.\nIn Europe, you see Germany came through with actually a small recession in the past quarter. There's a lot of back and forth. That fundamental point that the consumer is supported by a strong labor market and some wage growth, I think that's true, and we don't expect any dramatic changes on that front. That's why we remain positive about the outlook.\nIf you peel the onion a bit further, you look into different cohorts, and it's pretty clear that when it comes to higher income versus lower income, if you spend on an expensive trip or an experience during the summer, whatever you're trying to do, if you have more income, then you can do more of that, and if you have less income, then you can do less of that. What we generally see, though, as a function of the digital economy, the higher-end consumer, but certainly the mid-income and lower-income consumer, is much more empowered, empowered by having more data and the ability to look for a better deal.\nAnd that's what everybody's trying to do, to make things add up and work for them, that they still want to do that trip. So all of that together overall adds up to a picture that we feel pretty good, at least about our side of the business. And why do I say that? Because inflation and prices cut across carded and non-carded. But we're obviously particularly well-positioned in card categories. We've seen these cycles go on. Post-COVID, there was a lot of travel that's highly carded. So you saw that rise.\nAnd right now, you see a lot of inflation in auto insurance and rent that's not necessarily so much carded. So these are all the things that we think through. It comes back down to the fundamental point. In aggregate, we see healthy consumer spending and don't see that changing in the short term.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nAnd Andrew, I'll just add one point, and Michael's touched on this before, which is at the end of the day, our diversified business model lends really well in different environments because at the end of the day, right, we're geographically diversified. We've got great diversification across debit and credit. We've got good diversification around channels of spend.\nSo the reality is when these puts and takes take place in certain sectors of the economy, a dollar spent on one sector versus a dollar spent on the other sector, we're relatively indifferent so long as it's card spend. And that diversification really helps our business the way we are actually structured, which has not happened by chance. It's happened by design. And so that's something which is super important for us.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relation, Mastercard\n\nThank you. On that note, I'll hand it back to Michael for any closing comments.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right. Thanks, Devin. So everybody, over the past hour, we talked about the momentum and a good quarter. All of this obviously only happens because of the hard work of our colleagues at Mastercard. So I thank them, and I also want to thank you for your support for Mastercard. We're looking forward to speak to you in a quarter from now and hopefully see some of you at our Investor Day community meeting on 13 November in New York. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Our momentum continued this quarter as we once again delivered strong revenue and earnings growth. Quarter 1 net revenues were up 11% and adjusted net income up 16% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. These results were powered by healthy consumer spending and strong cross-border volume growth of 18% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We had new deal wins in every region, and we're driving growth by scaling our innovative technologies. That's why people choose Mastercard, a simple, seamless and secure way to pay. With these strong results, we are reiterating our full year 2024 outlook for both net revenue and operating expense on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. On the macroeconomic front, the picture remains mixed.\nFirst, strong labor markets and solid wage growth remain in countries across the globe. This is supportive of healthy consumer spending. Second, inflation has been moderating with a path towards normalization of monetary policy in most countries. Persistent inflation in the United States could delay rate cuts here. And third, geopolitical uncertainty remains in several countries. In addition to these areas, we are closely monitoring the strength of the dollar commodity prices and consumer balance sheet health. With tailwinds and headwinds to economic growth remain on balance, we are positive about the growth outlook. With this backdrop, we are focused on our strategic priorities: consumer payments, new flows and services and new networks. The recent realignment of our organizational structure will help our teams to execute on these priorities faster to deliver more value to our partners and customers.\nIn payments, our growth algorithm consists of being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments, further penetrating new flows, growing market share and optimizing our customer portfolios. I will address a few of those. Starting with the shift to digital for person to merchant payments, this secular opportunity has been a very important component of our growth algorithm across both volume and transactions. We are confident this will continue over the long term. Our acceptance footprint is a key competitive advantage, and we continue to expand our reach globally while enhancing the user experience for digital transactions through our technologies. Our fast and secure contactless technology has been instrumental in displacing cash. Contactless now represents more than 2 of every 3 in-person switch purchase transactions, up from 1 in 3 prior to the pandemic. And our cap on phone capabilities are simply a cost-effective way for merchants of all sizes to accept digital card payments. We're now live in over 100 markets.\nIn Brazil alone, the number of active devices is now over 1.5 million. And Apple continues to expand tap-to-pay on iPhone in markets like Brazil, where recently the solution was rolled out by fintechs, Stone, NewBank, SumUp and Cloud Walk. -- payments become more digital, there is an increasing demand from consumers and merchants for a simpler and more secure payment experience. Whether online or through a wallet provider, our tokens, deliver an elevated level of security and payment credentials are shared between the bank and the merchant. This improves the performance of a client's portfolio while supporting new ways to pay. This key differentiator creates a flywheel effect. Lower fraud, higher approval rates and a better consumer experience bring more transactions and volume to the MasterCard network, which in turn drives more payments revenue and brings more data. Tokens also create a streamlined way to accelerate the monetization of associated services to our customers.\nIn quarter 1, tokenized transactions grew over 50% year-over-year with more room to go as only approximately 1 in 4 transactions on the MasterCard network are tokenized today. Further opportunity lies in the verticals traditionally underpenetrated by Card. Merchants are embracing solutions to simplify checkout, reduce missed payments and drive engagement. We are focused on segments such as housing and health care that have sizable spend and where our solutions can address the needs of providers and consumers. Rent payments is one vertical where we are working with aggregators to enable digital payments.\nIn health care, we're partnering with several providers to grow acceptance in key markets like Germany. And we are playing in the gaming community or puns intended, with partners like global video game commerce company, Xola to improve the payment experience. The opportunity to bring more transactions onto the Mastercard network remains. We now switch approximately 2/3 of our total transactions worldwide, up from approximately 55% in 2018. Our actions in markets where switching penetration was historically low like Japan, Mexico, Colombia and Chile have increased this penetration, and we will continue to focus on this. My takeaway for you is the secular opportunity is large and it's lasting, and we are well positioned to go after it. Our momentum also continues with issuers and co-brand partners as we are winning new deals and retaining key business in every region.\nStarting in the Americas. In the first quarter, we further solidified our position in Brazil. signing an agreement with Banco Bradesco, one of the largest banks in the market across credit, commercial and services. We're making great progress in converting the previously announced debit wins in the United States. The Fiserv Money Network card program for the California Employment Development Department has now gone live with Mastercard. On the conversions of Citizens and Webster, we are well underway. We're further strengthening our leadership position with retail co-brands in the U.S., Mastercard will be the exclusive network for the city issued Dillard's co-brand. We have also extended our long-standing partnerships with Target and the TJX companies.\nIn Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, we signed a 10-year exclusive partnership with First Abu Dhabi Bank, the largest bank in the UAE. The agreement spans consumer and commercial issuance across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt. We entered into a new exclusive co-brand agreement across the EMEA region with Global Hotel Alliance, the world's largest alliance of independent hotel brands. And in India, we signed a 10-year consumer credit issuance deal with Axis Bank.\nAnd finally, in Europe, we extended our long-standing partnership with. The deal renews our payments relationship with one of the largest banks in the region while continuing to embed comprehensive marketing, consulting and loyalty solutions. These examples, like many others, are true partnerships. Our teams are invested in making them a win-win experience, and we will continue to use our innovative product capabilities and differentiated service offerings and our solution selling approach us positive results for our customers and for Mastercard. Now you asked before, why are we winning? That's exactly why we're winning.\nMoving next to the new flows pillar of our growth algorithm. We continue to execute against our strategy to further penetrate the addressable market in targeted areas like commercial payments, and disbursements and remittances. Growth in commercial is about making sure we are connected to the right partners and have the right solutions to power growth, made great strides in securing key partnerships, including traditional banks, travel and ERP providers. We previously announced our expanded agreement with Wells Fargo in the U.S. As part of our small business relationship, I'm happy to share that we've made significant progress in the conversion of this card portfolio to the Mastercard network. Also this quarter, we won our first commercial credit issue in steel with SBI Card in India. And commercial solutions were components of the Banco Bradesco and First Abu Dhabi Bank deals I mentioned earlier.\nIn addition to aligning with the right partners, it's also about having the right solutions to help commercial clients address their needs, like consumers, they want an easy and secure payment experience. Our new innovative mobile virtual card app enables commercial cards to be seamlessly added to digital wallets as we do as a consumer, but businesses can easily enable employees to pay for expenses with a click and a smile. At the same time, they can optimize back-office processes with robust spend controls, enhanced reconciliation data. HSBC Australia and Westpac will be the first financial institutions to offer this solution. The same principle applies to the open-loop commercial fleet space, where we are the market leader. Our differentiated capabilities have positioned us as a preferred partner with the market-leading fleet providers such as Core pay. And fleet fintech AB has announced they will now convert their commercial credit card program exclusively to the Mastercard network.\nAnd sticking to new flows, disbursement and remittances, we continue to extend our reach to new markets. In quarter 1, we grew transactions by over 40% and Combined, our portfolio of domestic and international money movement capabilities into 1 offering, Mastercard move. It includes our Mastercard Send and cross-border services and reaches nearly 10 billion endpoints worldwide. This quarter, we extended our reach further in China with our connection to Alipay, the U.S., we're partnering with Verituity to create a white label solution for banks to modernize their disbursements and remittances through a plug-and-play solution. And we will work with Sweden based to support account-based cross-border and domestic payments.\nNow shifting from payments to services and new networks, another important component of our growth algorithm. It starts with a powerful set of diversified solutions with best-in-class fraud capabilities, data analytics, consulting, marketing, loyalty, identity and open banking assets. These carefully curated assets help us grow and diversify our revenues and differentiate our payments. We drive growth in services and new networks across several vectors. First, remember, a portion of our services revenue is driven by payments. and these metrics continue to perform well. In addition, we're driving growth by increasing the penetration of existing customers. We're extending our services across new customers and new payment flows, and we build and deploy new solutions.\nHere are a few examples of how we're executing against these. Starting with increasing penetration with existing customers. success in delivering our services, strengthen relationships and can generate opportunities for future service engagements. Our best-in-class conversion support is often an entry point. A great example is with Westpac in Australia and New Zealand where we expanded our service offerings to include digital strategy, marketing solutions, innovation sprints and portfolio optimization campaigns. We have a diverse set of solutions to also help banks manage critical business needs outside of payments. take credit risk, for example, core to all banks. Our consultants are working with Ford Brazil to improve their credit policies and management.\nIn a Saudi National Bank, we are enabling new credit risk modeling and scoring capabilities. There's still room to further penetrate services. Our top 50 services customers on average are using 2 to 3x more services than the balance of our issuing and acquiring customer base. We're also driving growth by extending our reach across multiple rails and networks outside of the MasterCard network. MasterCard Access provides customers with a single trusted connection to quickly and easily source a suite of services. and we are seeing great traction. For example, Saudi National Bank will leverage access to deploy a set of scheme-agnostic services across their portfolio. We also continue to innovate and develop new services and solutions. This helps us to meet the evolving needs of our clients while growing our addressable target market.\nHere's an example. Think about how people are shifting to streaming and other digital services. As they do, they're looking for 1 simple view of all their subscriptions. I think we've all been there. It's why we developed smart subscriptions. It's an open banking powered solution that puts a simple dashboard of all subscriptions regardless of network right into their consumer banking application. Cyber Crime is a growing concern. Last year alone, people in the United States lost over $12 billion to Internet scans. Scan Protect builds on the cybersecurity protections we have delivered for years. combines our identity biometric AI and open banking capabilities to identify and prevent scans before they occur.\nAs part of this, we're partnering with organizations around the world, including Verizon, to collaborate on new solutions to protect consumers. By combining Mastercard's identity Insights with Verizon's robust network technologies, new AI power tools will be designed to more accurately identify and block scammers. We continue to enhance our solutions with generative AI to deliver even more value, a world-leading real-time fraud solution, Decision Intelligence, has been helping banks score and safely approve billions of transactions, ensuring the safety of consumers and the entire payments networks for years. The next-generation technology, Decision Intelligence Pro is supercharged by generative AI to improve the overall score and boost fraud detection rates on average by 20%.\nSo overall, there's a strong demand for our services and new networks across a diverse customer base. They continue to grow faster than the core, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead. With that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We are successfully executing against our strategy in realizing our growth algorithm -- our differentiated capabilities, our diversified business model and our focused strategy poses well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nWell, thank you, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. In line with our outlook, net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 12%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 16% and 19%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a lower tax rate, primarily due to a change in geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments was $3.31, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2 billion worth of stock and an additional $815 million through April 26, 2024.\nLet's turn to Page 4, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the first quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., GDP increased by 6% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 6%. Outside of the U.S. volume increased 13% with credit growth of 12% and debit growth of 13%. The Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.\nTurning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 13% year-over-year in Q1. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 67% of all in-person switched to purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. The Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded costs issued.\nTurning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the first quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. payment network net revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-Added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 15% despite tougher comps in Q1 2023. This growth was primarily driven by strong growth in our underlying drivers and continued demand for our consulting and marketing services loyalty solutions and fraud and security capabilities. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions.\nNow let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV also grew 10%. And Cross-border assessments increased 22%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix and pricing. Transaction processing assessments were up 12%, while switched transactions grew 13%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year, partially offset by favorable mix. Other network assessments were $226 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period.\nMoving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as an increase in indirect taxes as discussed on our Q4 earnings call. This was partially offset by the timing of advertising and marketing spend.\nTurning to Page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the first quarter and through the first 4 weeks of April. As a reminder, our Q1 switch metrics include the impact of the leap year in 2024, which added just over 1 ppt of growth across each of switched volumes, switch transactions and cross-border volumes. In addition, our switch metrics in Q1 and in the first 4 weeks of April were impacted by the timing of Easter, which occurred at the end of Q1 this year as compared to in April in 2023. After removing the impact of those 2 items, our operating metric trends were generally stable for the quarter as well as when looking at the first 4 weeks of April. A few items to note. U.S. switched volume and transaction growth benefited from the commencement of the conversion of the Citizens debit portfolio to Mastercard Outside of the U.S., growth was negatively impacted primarily by the lapping of the conversion of the NatWest debit portfolio to Mastercard. Cross-border card Norand ex travel continues to show strength and cross-border travel growth was impacted by tougher comps as we continue to lap the recovery of travel, particularly in Asia Pacific, which opened up later from COVID restrictions than the rest of the world.\nTurning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. Our business fundamentals remain strong and our diversified business model and momentum with customers position us well for the opportunities ahead. This is all underpinned by healthy consumer spending, the secular shift to digital forms of payment and strong demand across our value-added services and solutions offerings. As Michael said, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we are monitoring, and we stand ready to manage investment levels as appropriate, while maintaining focus on the execution of our strategy. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook.\nAs it relates to the full year 2024, our thoughts for net revenue and operating expenses remain unchanged on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. We expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects continued healthy consumer spending and higher value-added services and solutions growth in all quarters for the balance of the year as compared to Q1. We Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. And foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of 1 to 2 ppt for the year, primarily driven by the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar.\nIn terms of operating expenses, our expectations for the full year are to grow at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year, while we expect a 0 to 1 ppt benefit from foreign exchange.\nNow turning to Q2 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while we expect an approximately 2 ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a low double-digit range versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 01 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter.\nOther items to keep in mind, on other income and expenses in Q2, we expect an expense of approximately $85 million. This expense is higher than what we had in Q1, driven by lower forecasted net average cash balances in Q2, primarily due to higher working capital requirements as well as the geographic mix of cash. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% for both Q2 and on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Audrey, you may open up the line for Q&A now.",

Good morning everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Quarter four net revenues were up 11% and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items. As always, these results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter powered by a broad range of unique diversified products and services, both designed to solve our customers' needs. Let's start on the macroeconomic front where we see both tailwinds and headwinds. First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages. These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we're monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates.\nSecond, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely and will manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy and cross border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in fourth quarter on a local currency basis. With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities which fuel our growth algorithm across payments, services, and new networks in payments.\nOur growth algorithm consists of five key ones, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies, two accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions, three further penetrating the addressable market in new flows, four growing market share, and five optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing, and that's not in our control. However, we are executing on the rest. Building on that, the runway for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions, and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases. In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide. This growth has been aided by scaling our Tap on Phone and Cloud Commerce capabilities. We are now live in over 80 markets.\nSmaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app, and larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store. We're supporting partners like Apple who in 2023 expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone into Australia, the U.K., France, Brazil, and several other markets. We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure, and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride. And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low dollar spend categories. We've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York operating broad-based open loop systems.\nHowever, there's still significant runway for us given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open loop systems at scale.\nWe're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, Tokenization, and Biometrics. They offer embedded, secure, and password-free checkout solutions and with that bring an elevated level of security, simplicity, and speed to every transaction. That's true regardless of the device, browser, or card. These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction. Issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness for Click to Pay. We are now live in over 35 countries supported by over 50 channel partners and in 2023 we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate. We're driving Tokenization across all channels including devices, commerce platforms, card on file, and guest checkout.\nTokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. We're expanding our biometric payment capabilities which enable payments with a smile or a wave. After launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia Pacific region.\nWe're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account to account, and new flows. This week we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. debit portfolio to Mastercard, making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets, fraud solutions, and our shared commitment to financial inclusion. This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year, building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy, will migrate their debit card pool to Mastercard as well.\nWe renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia where we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios. We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expands into new services including data analytics. In Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial consumer credit and prepaid portfolios. We're also winning in fintechs, co-brands, and public sector partners. When it comes to fintechs, Mastercard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top Digital Payment and New Bank Fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list this quarter. Starling Bank, one of the largest Fintechs in the U.K., renewed their partnership with Mastercard. In the co-brand space, we're partnering with J.\nJ.Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital-first card. In the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February the largest unemployment program in the United States. As you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services while always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind, and in turn further drive services growth.\nLooking to China, we are thrilled that our joint venture in China has received formal approval to commence domestic bank card clearing. We believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience. Using a single card is optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium- to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market. ICBC launched the first World Mastercard product in November, and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card.\nBeyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account to account space. This quarter we announced a long-term strategic partnership with the Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network which continues to secure our position in real time payments in the United States.\nNow shifting gears, we continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances. We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable, which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone, we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FleetCor, two of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium. And on the virtual card front, we announced two exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda, turning now to disbursements and remittances. In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases. For example, UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability.\nThis will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China.\nPayments, Services, and New Networks Reinforce Each Other. We said it countless times; our services and new networks provide differentiation. As noted in many of the wins I mentioned, underlying payments growth helps drive services too, and payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights, and when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments. In turn, this generates even more data, more transactions, more need for fraud tools, and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types, and continuing to build and deploy new services.\nHere are a few examples how we are executing against each of these the past year. Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn, program management, and supplier enablement solutions. This is on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing, and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio lifecycle management.\nWorldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process, and Citi has deployed Consumer Clarity Digital Receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly through their bank app. Now, with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file. Square is also integrating Consumer Clarity Solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chosen Mastercard as a strategic partner to roll out Open Banking for e-commerce payments across Europe. The list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's Open Banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S. marketplace and reduce fraud. Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders.\nWe also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with Generative AI. Generative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers and makes it easier to extract insights from our data. It can also help us increase internal productivity. We're working on many GenAI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced Shopping Muse. Shopping Muse uses Generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online and can translate consumers' colloquial language into tailored recommendations.\nAnother example is Mastercard Small Business AI. The tool will draw on our existing small business resources along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year, will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone. And finally, we expanded Mastercard Access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI, digital, and identity services. Using Access, customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks, including those outside the Mastercard network. This is an exciting development which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities.\nSo with that, I will wrap it up in summary. We delivered another strong quarter end year of revenue and earnings growth. We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model, and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nGreat. Thanks Michael. Turning now to page three, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding, where applicable, special items, and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions, and operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18% respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth, as well as a non-recurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter.\nEPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchase. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $586 million through January 26, 2024.\nSo let's turn to page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide, gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year.\nTurning to page five, switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q4. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8% globally. There are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.\nTurning to slide six for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis, Payments Network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, and also includes growth in rebates and incentives, value-added services and solutions. Net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our cyber and intelligence solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics, and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions.\nNow let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again described on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric, domestic assessments were up 7% while worldwide GDV grew 10%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross border assessments increased 21% while cross border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10% while switch transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were $251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period.\nMoving on to page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising, and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup.\nTurning to page nine, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019, given that we are well past the pandemic. Now, let me comment on the operating metric trends in fourth quarter and through the first four weeks of January.\nStarting with switch volume growth year-over-year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all Mastercard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard specific to the U.S. the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps.\nMoving to the first four weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S. was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country. As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impacts from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year over year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio.\nSwitched transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first four weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to show strength.\nTurning now to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024. Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card, and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook. Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events, and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities.\nAs it relates to the full year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full-year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items of note. This includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense.\nAcquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact on this growth rate for the year. Now turning to Q1 2024 year-over-year, net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact on this growth rate for the quarter. Let me briefly talk through why our full year currency neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by two factors. First, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year.\nAnd second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace, from a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps.\nFrom an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single digit rate versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 percentage point related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind on the other income and expense line: we expect an expense of approximately $60 million-$65 million for Q1 given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16%-17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full-year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. Thank you.\nBriana. You may open the call for questions now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please only press star one once to queue up for a question as pressing star one multiple times may affect your position in the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\nYour first question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning. I want to ask about U.S. card volumes. So weather aside, the growth has decelerated a bit to mid single digit levels versus what we've seen in the last five to 10 years, especially if you.\nCompare that to PC.\nSo how should we think about kind of a normalized card volume growth in the U.S. or is there simply more runway on number of transactions?\nSo that's the metric we should be watching.\nAlso just as a follow up, can you also comment on Reg II?\nImpact on U.S. dollars?\nThank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. Harshita, let me take both those questions. First on Reg II, let me just kind of share with everybody that from a Reg II standpoint we haven't seen any material impact come through as far as what we've seen so far in the data. Obviously we'll keep a close eye on it as the year progresses, but nothing to actually report from any sort of material impact on your question around our gross dollar volume growth. You know, look at the end of the day, here's the way we think about it, right? We continue to believe that in the U.S. there remains a decent amount of secular opportunity both from a volume standpoint and from a transaction growth standpoint. In addition to that, as you know, business models are evolving, spending behaviors are changing, and that creates greater opportunity from a volume transaction standpoint.\nBut more specifically, what I tell you is the following, which is as it relates to the U.S. we've got to kind of think about what's going on with PCE and what the impact of inflation is in the PCE numbers relative to where it's taking place. That is, is it taking place in carded volumes or is it taking place in non-carded categories of spend? So as you do the analysis, or at least as we do the analysis, the way we think about this is we look at PCE, we think about on a normalized basis. If inflation were to take place fairly evenly across both carded and non-carded PCE, it gives us a high degree of comfort that there's a decent amount of secular opportunity which still remains in the U.S. from a growth standpoint.\nNow, in addition to the secular opportunity and the fact that the U.S. continues to actually perform well from an overall consumer health standpoint, we're very active; we're growing our volumes by winning share. I mean you've heard about this quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we're doing to win volumes from new customers; we've had good wins on the debit space, which as you know, is a challenged kind of environment in the U.S., so overall, I tell you, from the U.S. standpoint, it continues to be a very important market, one which is going to be a decent contributor to our growth driven by the PCE growth component, the secular shift, as well as share. And again, all I'm talking about is on the card payment volume side of the business.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nPerfect.\nThank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nDirector of Research and Managing Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah.\nGood morning.\nThanks.\nSo two questions. One, to what degree are conversions of new wins contributing to fiscal year 2024 guidance? And secondly, regarding China, you know, knowing that you need to launch your business there within six months of approval, I was wondering if you could characterize conversations with issuers there and whether you've been able to keep warm relationships with those issuers over the years considering you were in a very strong position in China when regulations changed.\nWhatever it was, seven, eight years ago. Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nLet me take the China question first, and we come back to the conversion topic that you raised. So needless to say, we're thrilled about China. So this is a, it's a massive economy, and we feel we're well positioned to serve it. As I said in my remarks at the beginning, we feel we're uniquely positioned to put into the hand of Chinese consumers a solution, a seamless solution that works domestically as well as when they travel. That's not unique. There's another competitor that has that kind of a proposition. But we do have the much better acceptance network to provide an end to end solution that works well on that basis.\nWe're busy right now with our partners in China, with the banks, with acquirers, issuers, and so forth to discuss rolling out on the issuing side as well as on the acceptance side for six months, as you rightly said. Now for years we have been very active in China on the cross border side and those are strong relationships with the same exact banks. And you know, we're just, I mentioned too with ICBC and Bank of Communications where we're just launching new products. So the fact that we are well positioned today with the banks gives us an edge here on moving forward at speed. As I also said, going live within the first six months doesn't mean that we're live everywhere and we have to build this out over time to get full opportunity in the medium to the long term.\nOn the conversion piece, just to know for the U.S. we saw I mentioned this earlier for Webster Bank and for Citizens, conversion is starting. Some of the big conversions in Europe have already completed. Sachin Mehra talked about the lapping for NatWest and so forth. So Sachin, if there's anything else.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, no, Craig, I would just say like Michael said, right. I mean as you would imagine in terms of how we think about 2024 and our thoughts for 2024, we do factor in what our best estimate is as it relates to the conversion of the portfolios. What I tell you is we've had a decent amount of wins across the globe. For the most part, the sizable ones are staggered wins, as in they come on over a period of time. They're not episodic flips which will take place all at one time. So for example, you know, Citizens, Webster, UniCredit, you know, Deutsche Bank, all of these will play out over the course of 24 and some instances over multiple years. So we factor in our best estimates on those conversions as we kind of put our thoughts together for the year.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nDirector of Research and Managing Director, FT Partners\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your anjis open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, Sachin. Thank you for sort.\nOf the cadence for the year with the first quarter. But I was just wondering, could you.\nJust elaborate a little bit more on the expectations for payments versus the value.\nAdded service revenues and then specific to.\nThat Brazil tax legislation, I guess, is.\nIt neutral to EPS? It adds to OpEx but lowers taxes. Just maybe you could help us with that too. Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure. Let me just take the Brazil one first and I'll come back to your second question. So on the Brazil piece, it increases our operating expenses because it's an increase in indirect taxes which are there. It's more than offset in our tax rate and in the thoughts we've given you from a tax rate standpoint. So from an overall EPS standpoint, it actually ends up being slightly accretive because of the more than offset which is taking place on the tax line. That on your question around payments versus value added services and solutions expectations. Look, we're not giving specific guidance as it relates to how we see payment network revenue and value added services and solutions revenue. But at the high level, here's what I'd say. You know, let me first address the value added services and solutions piece.\nWe continue to see good growth in our solutions around everything around our fraud and security solutions, our data analytics and insights. And you know, we're building all of those into our thoughts for the year. We've had a good year in 2023, we could see a good outlook for value-added services and solutions going into 2024. Likewise for payments.\nRight.\nI mean, as you can imagine in payments, it's a function of what we think will happen from a carded market volume growth rate standpoint and what the impacts will be from share wins as well as the impacts of rebates and incentives. So all of that kind of is factored in. What I would tell you broadly is that we continue to expect value-added services and solutions to grow at a faster pace than we do on the payment network side.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail here. Just thinking about the outlook, I think.\nHarshita asked it as well, just the.\nOutlook for growth between the U.S. and rest of world. Anything to call out there? Do you expect the trends observed in 2023 to be different in 2024 here between the two regions? Thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, honestly, I would tell you from a secular opportunity standpoint, right? I mean, we continue to believe, broadly speaking, the secular opportunity is greater outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. There's a good news, bad news story there. The good news is that that means we've been quite successful in driving the secular shift opportunity in the U.S., which is, you know, which is what you're seeing in the results come through.\nAnd again, from a bad news standpoint, is there's a lower remaining opportunity on the volume side in the U.S., but if you ask me the question on a year-over-year basis, I would tell you I don't expect any meaningful shift in terms of suddenly the trajectory of how the secular opportunity is being realized between the U.S. and the rest of the world to be changing between 2023 and 2024.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nVery clear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from . Your line is open.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning. I heard you call out a couple of times geopolitical concerns. I know that there's some, I don't know, 30 or 40 different elections happening around. So my question to you is, as you think about managing those potential concerns, are there certain regions where you feel like there could be pockets of more nationalistic behavior which would be problematic for.\nYou guys getting into those markets, or?\nThat, because of election years, historically what you've seen is that it kind of slows down adoption and some of those.\nSecular trends that you would have otherwise.\nBeen able to enjoy and maybe a notch election year. So just trying to handicap what maybe.\nSome of those positives and negatives could be just geopolitically this year.\nThanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, Dan, you just touched on some of the key things to watch out for. But this is no different than U.S. monitoring fiscal monetary policy reactions by central banks and governments. So those are all things that affect consumer sentiment, potentially affect consumer spending. So we'll just have to stay close to what that is. Our discipline around these things is to do some solid scenario planning and making sure our playbook in terms of managing our financials responsibility responsibly is up to date. Certainly the last three years have had no shortages of such challenges, and we adapted quickly, more specifically to the points that you mentioned.\nYou know, elections happen regularly, so there is nothing dramatically new in 2024, and geopolitical conflicts—they've been around, and they keep going, and that is something watch what is the impact on energy prices and various downstream into the broader economy. Yet again, our economics institute is keeping a focus on that. So nothing very specific. That's why we kept it relatively high level. But these days, one has to just take a look left and right all the time.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks. It's good to see the value-added services and solutions accelerate. I think it went back to 17% from 14%.\nMaybe you could just revisit that for.\nA minute, in terms of, I know you sounded confident that that should sustain.\nStrong growth relative to the business, so maybe just revisit the drivers.\nOf that and what gives you the.\nConfidence that sustains and really just overall.\nIf you sort of rank the top.\nItems in that category. Thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nLet me kick off on that. If you split out the value-added services here, you have our other services, which Sachin touched on earlier. For example, our real-time payment assets and things like that. The things that we have historically focused on here in this space are our cyber and intelligence solutions, fraud solutions, and the data insights and analytics solutions. If you think about how that flywheel talks about, I talked about the powerful cycle earlier on. More payments, more payments that need to be kept safe, more payments throughout, more data, which drive more data analytics inside. That is the underlying kind of secular trend, which is pretty closely related to the secular shift as well. That is the baseline of growth here. You look at some of the more specific growth drivers here.\nFor example, in data analytics in that group we also have our personalization solution. Everybody's trying to engage their consumers at this point. That is on the banking side, it's on the merchant side. Here, coming in with a solution that provides the right offer through the right channel at the right time to drive through that clutter. We have the number one personalization company that we acquired two years ago. That is one of the drivers. We expect some big growth there. You look at the other hand on the cyber and security solutions, digital identity, an authentication solution. Today, nobody likes passwords. You're in a situation where you have to end up making trade-offs between simplicity and security when it comes to digital payments.\nWith our technology, we find ways to go around that, effectively driving down fraud. At the same time, we ensure that there's low abandonment rates. Biometric solutions, I talked about them earlier, is one of those examples. Across these two portfolios, CNI and DNS, Cyber Analytics, and Data Insights, that's where we see the big growth and the big demand. Other solutions, real time payments, we have a strong position there. We talked about this a couple of quarters ago, where we said we are in the markets in which we are, and we're driving to scale volumes. The reference to our strategic partnership with TCH just shows that we continue on that front. Those are kind of the key drivers that we see here. We feel this is a uniquely differentiated portfolio, and it's in great demand.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's helpful. Thanks, Beth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Kennedy with William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nChris Kennedy\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You just talked about it. Can you give a broader update on your digital identity solutions and what your strategy is for that and how it can ultimately impact your business? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, let me do that. I just gave you the headlines on that. Specifically within that, there's a whole set of solutions from biometric to identity events where we have an ability to provide an identity confidence score to one of our customers, saying this person has lived at this address before and here is their previous employment. With a certain level of confidence, we can say this is the person. All this stuff is happening behind the scenes. That is the approach that we're taking. You know, it's not just our identity data. We are combining this with open banking, and we're trying to find use cases where this really makes a difference. For example, an account opening.\nWe're taking our open banking technology and our affinity footprint here in the United States, you know, all the way up to 90% of our deposit accounts in this market. We're taking our digital identity solution into a premium account owner verification, an account opening solution. Those are the kind of examples where we see we're truly differentiated. At the highest level, it's before and after the transaction. We're driving value through digital identity. We feel this is absolutely central to the digital economy, and that's why we put it in the new network because there are people who have identity data, and there are people who want to use identity data. We don't want to hold it. We're sitting somewhere in the middle, and we are essentially the trusted partner that can prove one way or another if a person is the person they claim to be.\nMinimal use of data, permission data, that's the approach.\n\nChris Kennedy\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.\n\nPaul Golding\n\nSenior U.S. Payments and Digital Commerce Analyst, Macquarie\n\nThanks so much. I guess to touch on Finicity, since you just mentioned it, Michael, do you see this evolving more so as a value-added service and solution driver or volume driver now that you've had it in the portfolio for some time? As a follow-on, just wanted to see if we could get some more color on the acceptance location growth from a regional perspective, given the strength in international volumes in the period. Thank you so much.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, starting with Finicity, we have the corresponding set of capabilities through our IR acquisition in Europe. We're also building out connectivity in Australia. Those are the three regions where we're focused. Open banking does a number of things.\nEssentially what we see is a set of use cases here that rise to the top, and everything that you could do with open banking. In the end, there's this big vision about open data where people can use their data footprint, small businesses can use their data footprint for getting access to better services. For now, what's really rising to the top is account opening. The example that I already gave, open banking for payments, I come to that for a moment. In a moment, open banking for lending and for small business in particular. Those are kind of the three categories that we feel are particularly relevant right now for payments. It's really interesting. To your point, is this a volume driver? It could be.\nBecause the connectivity that we have here, what we're trying to do is facilitate payments, for example, in non-carded use cases, as we have with the Pay by Bank solution in the United States in partnership with Jace Bank. We hope to see significant volume growth out of that. That's the whole idea, and that builds on our experience with Pay by Bank in the U.K. This is a somewhat different approach here in the U.S., where our open banking capabilities are the true differentiator. Use cases that matter, that's the focus, and out of that we hope to see not only API clicks on account opening, but also payment volume coming through.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThat was the second part of the question. Thank you. My team is just reminding me, acceptance growth, regionally I mean, it comes to the answer, actually, that Sachin gave earlier where we talked a little bit about payments growth in the regional comparison. You know, when you think beyond the United States, we see tremendous growth opportunity out here. In the United States, you would say it's more new use cases and verticals, and it's more generally in broader acceptance across the payments landscape. In the rest of the world, there's even significant geographic opportunities to grow. Take Japan, for example. It's a country where the government has put out a stated policy to drive a cashless Japan, so tremendous upside there. We talked about China earlier on where we're investing heavily in acceptance footprint.\nI would say it's leaning a little more on the international side. Here in the U.S., we're very busy going for use cases and verticals.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you. Good morning. Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. Could you share your insights into your runway for growth in some of your largest countries, for example Germany and Italy, and maybe frame that in terms of payment volume growth and vast growth opportunity?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nLet me start off with that question. First of all, I do want to underline what you just said. It is a source of differentiated growth for us. We've had a great run in Europe, and it's a combination of share growth, but it's also driven by the ways that we find to go after the accelerated secular shift that we saw on the back end of COVID. Countries like Germany really driving up contactless usage, just to give you one example. Overall, Europe's been firing on all cylinders for us. You know, I come back to the growth algorithm that we laid out for payments, which applies very much in Europe, so that, you know, European economies.\nWill do what they do, but we.\nWill continue to focus on share gain. We will also be very busy to take the share gains that we've already had and turn that into profitable volume for us, conversions driving that. We had a question on that earlier. That's driver number one. Going into new flows in Europe, there is opportunity there as well. If you look at alternative payment systems, everything that's going on in Europe, clearly through PSD2, PSD3, and so forth, there's a lot of movement in Europe that we will stay on top of. As we look ahead into that, you see our differentiated assets in bill pay in the Nordics and so forth. We have a pretty broad footprint to participate in all the drivers in Europe in terms of services. Services has been strong in Europe for a long time.\nOur advisors, our consulting business has been a winner for us in Europe for the longest time. If you look at some of these big wins that we've talked about, they all have a significant contribution of services. In fact, I would say oftentimes they are one of the reasons that we win those deals. Nothing dramatically different there. I think Europe has caught up on secular trend and digitization, and we're firing on all syndrome. We're fully invested in Europe. As you know, one of the big topics in Europe is European sovereignty, and we're deeply invested in Europe with our efforts. We're engaging with, you know, in Brussels and the nation states and so forth, which is very important for us to do, to be a partner on their journey.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard",
    "content2": "Yeah, David, it's Sachin. I'll just emphasize what Michael just said. Right. He's mentioned on a couple occasions today that, you know, payments drives value added services and solutions, and value added services and solutions drive payments. It's no different in Europe, right? For all the share wins we've had in Europe, for all the growth we're seeing on the payment side, it creates new opportunities for us on the services side. Vice versa, as you actually do deliver on those services, you get the benefit of additional data. When you get the benefit of additional data, you're able to help optimize existing portfolios, which again drives payment volume growth. That's not unique to Europe. It's actually true for the way we run the business globally.\nThe fact that we are actually increasingly becoming more prominent in the payment flow enables that cycle to work quite effectively.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nI just wanted to ask about the yields on the domestic assessment revenue line.\nYou know, that yield has declined year over year for some time now, and it came in a little bit lighter than some were expecting this quarter.\nI think you highlighted mix impact in.\nThe yields or the spread between revenue and volume growth.\nCould you just provide some more detail around the specific changes that you're seeing in terms of mix?\nCan we get to a place where domestic yields are actually expanding year over year?\nThank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah, look, I mean, I'll comment on the yield piece because what you're seeing effectively in the fourth quarter of 2023, when you look at payment network net revenue divided by GDV, is what you see every year in terms of the sequential decline in yields. That's primarily being driven by the fact that, remember, in the third quarter of all years, we tend to have our strongest cross-border performance, and our cross-border tends to come with our best yields. What you've got is, you're getting more bang for the buck for dollar GDV on the cross-border side than you are on the domestic volume side. That's what's causing that sequential decline. You'll see that as a pattern which has existed in prior years as well.\nBroadly speaking, I would tell you that otherwise there's nothing unusual to call out on the payment network net revenue yield. The one reminder I'll give you is that we run the business not only to optimize payment network net revenue yield, but overall net revenue yield for our company. Again, goes back to the question David asked right before you, Ken, which is at the end of the day, we've got to be in the payment flow. We've got to allow ourselves to have the opportunity to deliver services on those payments to generate additional revenue, which causes for overall net accretion in our overall net revenue yield.\nI know your question is specific to payment network net revenue yield, but I just wanted to make sure you know that from our mindset standpoint, we're looking at payment network net revenue yield as well as overall net revenue go.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nFor the company, I should say. You know, earlier when I was talking about the payment algorithm, I said that we are putting great focus on our financial discipline, and we do it with revenues in mind, and with services revenue in mind. Yes, it needs to add up to the overall net revenue yield, as Sachin just said. I'm telling you, we don't want to win every deal. We want to win the deals we want to win, and we're pretty disciplined about it.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to dig in, Michael, if I might a little bit more on your pay by bank initiatives.\nCan this be, especially as we see the emergence of networks like Pix in Brazil, for example, can this be a sort of a standalone growth driver in its own right, or is it sort of folded into your overall comments on open banking? I just wanted to see if there's an important distinction to draw as we think about, go forward, growth opportunities.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nRight. I think both questions, your question and the previous question, hit on an important point there. There is a particular point of interest for us at the intersection of open banking and payments. It enables the open banking connectivity, enables us to go after use cases that we otherwise wouldn't be able to go after. Here's additional data that is available that you can then combine in combination with an underlying RTP rail to make a profitable proposition for a customer, which is exactly what Chase Pay by Bank is. Basically, you debit your customer when there's a balance, and that is what the open banking connectivity tells you. That's a good solution.\nIf we look broadly around the world, Pix, UPI in India, FedNow, there's a bunch of real time payment systems, and those are the kind of rails where we have experience, we have connectivity in some, we operate them ourselves. That is exactly what we're looking at as one of the assets and the propositions that we will bring together for our customers. Now, more broadly speaking, when you look at Pix, when you look at UPI, one other thing to keep in mind is here's public sector doing a good job in pulling in more participants in the overall digital economy. We can come in with our solutions, our real time payment solutions, our card based solutions. They're basically extending the digital economy to create a tie that kind of lifts everybody's boats, financial inclusion being the headline. That's something to consider.\nSomewhere in between there are points that we will manage very carefully as and when these systems grow and they provide alternatives to our solutions that we compete and provide the best solution to consumers and to our customers. On the fraud side, on ease of use, a lot of these systems don't have all of these functionalities. Those are things that we focus on. We're focused on providing the best choice to our customers. We don't mind the competition, we actually see quite a bit of opportunity for us to use these rails for the open banking type of solution you just asked about. Interesting space and it drives the overall economic growth digitally.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director of Payments and FinTech Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thanks Sachin.\nI was just hoping you could put.\nA finer point on the growth algorithm within the full year revenue outlook. I know you mentioned some of the cadence dynamics with VAS and currencyvault, but any help on what you're assuming for volume and transaction growth relative to the January trends, rebates and incentives, pricing, any help on those would be great, thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nYeah. Look, I'm not going to give you specific kind of forecasts as it relates to what we're assuming from a driver standpoint. We've kind of shared with you what our base case is. The base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting the current spending dynamics from an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint. I think to your question on pricing, it's no different than it's been in the past. We always price based on the value we deliver to our customers, and we will continue to do that wherever it makes sense across the globe. We kind of have new things which we're launching. There's new value we're delivering to our customers, and as we do that, we'll continue to price for that. On specifically the contra question, I think.\nThe important thing to note on contra is that at the end of the day, contra is enabling volume growth. We pay incentives and rebates to our customers to bring more volume onto our network. As we do that, you know, we're paying for that for the first quarter. We expect our contra as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be, you know, roughly similar to what you saw in Q4 2023. I would tell you on a full year basis, it's going to be entirely a function of how we see deals play out, what the pipeline is. Obviously, we know what the outlook is from a pipeline standpoint. Some of that will come to fruition, some of that will not. There will be other things which will move in and out.\nI'm not going to kind of share with you what the full year outlook is on contra, but for Q1 I can kind of give you my thoughts, which are we expect that contra as a percentage of payment network assessments will be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 2023.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director of Payments and FinTech Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nI think we have time for just one more.\nBriana.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. Hi, Michael, Sachin. Good quarter.\nI appreciate all the comments so far.\nMy question is on real time payments.\nMichael, you did have some incremental.\nComments there on TCH, but saw the TCH renewal.\nObviously you have a global set of capabilities here. My question is what's the runway and what drives it? Is it use cases rather than more countries?\nIf it is use cases, what are some of the use cases that you see coming up?\nThat are.\nExciting from a convergence perspective?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. First of all, the strategic relationship here in the U.S. with The Clearing House is important to note. Back in 2016, 2017, real time payments really took off. This is when we invested in VocaLink, and VocaLink was a partner with The Clearing House at the time. A strong and more strategic renewal here is a big statement, and it speaks to our position in real time payments.\n10 out of the top 50 GDP countries we either operate or are providing software and services to the real time payment system. It's real, it's there as the name indicates, and it's carrying a lot of volume for us. In itself, that's an interesting business. It's much more than that. It's much more than that. As we're talking to various players, including the ones that I mentioned, about new applications that come on top of that. Coming right back to the Chase Pay by Bank example, here is access to Rails on one hand, and then a set of additional data that turns a simple payment that gets money from A to B to something that's a value add payment. That is where we're going to go. These use cases will play out in a somewhat different way.\nIt is obviously always obvious our interest to find global solutions, but it's also this is a rather more geographic, specifically driven space, so we'll have to see where that all lands. We keep that in mind, which is why we're not driving into many more markets. Right now we're the most critical markets, and here we're staying very close to where that is going. It's applications, and it's scaling volumes in the markets that we're in. It's where the focus is.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThank you very much.\nThank you.\nMichael, any last comments?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nWell, as always, thank you for your support to Mastercard. Thank you for listening to Sachin and me, and thank you to everybody at Mastercard for making all of this work. We'll speak to you in one quarter. It was also unusual to note this is on a Wednesday today. I don't think we ever had that before. Certainly for me this is the first Wednesday. We'll see how we mix it up next time. Speak to you in a quarter. Thank you, and bye bye.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard, Inc. Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Adra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Michael Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com.\nAdditionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance.\nActual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning from New York, everyone. Let me start by acknowledging the recent terror attacks in Israel and the resulting war with Hamas and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We're deeply saddened by the suffering and the loss. Our focus is on the well-being of our people. Those who have been directly impacted and those in our teams around the world who are dealing with this terrible situation. We will continue to give them support while contributing to relief efforts. We will monitor the situation closely so we can take action as required.\nTurning to our results. Our quarter 3 results demonstrate the strong fundamentals of our business, our diversified model and the continued resilience in consumer spending. Quarter 3 net revenues were up 11%, and operating income was up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items. On the macroeconomic front, there are a few factors we focus on. First, the labor market remains strong, which is a key driver of consumer spending. However, we continue to monitor aspects such as credit availability and savings behaviors.\nSecond, although inflation levels have moderated, they remain elevated. As central banks continue to actively manage monetary policy, we expect the impacts to vary across countries and sectors. Also, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern, further underscored by the recent events in the Middle East. We are monitoring these moving pieces and stand ready to manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy with some moderation in spend in select international markets.\nCross-border travel remains strong at 155% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. And cross-border card-present ex travel continues to hold up well at 209% of 2019 levels in the third quarter [indiscernible] cross-border card not present ex travel. So overall, consumer spending remains resilient, and we remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities. We see substantial runway for growth through the long-term potential [ in person ] to merchant payments, the sizable opportunity to address new payment flows, our diverse suite of fast-growing service capabilities and our investments in areas of future growth like open banking and digital identity. Let's explore these in more detail. Starting with person-to-merchant payments, where we see a sizable long-term growth opportunity. We're winning deals with a diverse set of partners and investing in technology to further drive the shift to electronic forms of payment and capture new ways to pay.\nIn the third quarter, our deal momentum across the globe continued. In the U.S., we are happy to announce that Webster Bank, a leading commercial bank in the Northeast has chosen Mastercard as their exclusive payment network. It selected us because of our marketing assets, safety and security tools and commitment to small business. This builds up on recent wins in the U.S. like the Citizens debit portfolio [indiscernible] with the transition on track for 2024.\nThese 2 wins are clear examples of the value we deliver through our partnerships and the reasons banks are willing to move their debit business to Mastercard. Further, we have partnered with Citi's wealth business to launch their ultra-high net worth credit proposition, targeting their private bank clients in Singapore and Hong Kong. And in East Africa, we signed a long-term deal with Equity Bank Group that significantly increases our share across the 6 markets where they have presence.\nOn the co-branded front, we joined Barclays to launch Xbox first credit card in the United States. Building off our long-standing relationship with Microsoft, this product is an example of how we're tapping into the fast-growing gaming space. And of course, we continue to strengthen our travel-focused programs, renewing our FRONTIER Airlines program issued by Barclays as well as the Turkish Airlines program with Garanti BBVA. Winning deals positions us well to capture PCE and secular growth. There's a sizable opportunity across volumes and transactions, and we benefit from both. We're bringing together innovation, technology, the experience and trust that consumers want and expect in their daily lives, and that starts with our best-in-class digital solutions such as contactless and tokenization.\nContactless now represents 63% of our in-person switch purchase transactions and the convenience and security of our capabilities are helping us to further penetrate verticals like Transit. By converting transit to open loop, we gain access to more low-ticket, high-frequency transactions, both at the station and the surrounding merchants. In the last quarter alone, we launched open loop programs with 2 of the largest transit systems in North America, Toronto and Philadelphia.\nWe're now live with over 25 agencies in the U.S. and Canada. This year, in the Netherlands, we supported the launch of a nationwide contactless transit payment system. And in Pakistan, we're helping to digitize daily commutes in Karachi with issuance over 1 million prepaid open-loop cards. On tokenization, it has been 10 years since we first introduced the token standard to the industry. Today, it is foundational to the network, and it's performing exceptionally well.\nThe number of tokenized transaction has more than doubled over the past 2 years. We just processed over 3 billion tokenized transactions in 1 month. And this functionality is extending to new places to pay. For example, Mercedes-Benz customers in Germany can now pay for fuel directly from their vehicle using only their fingerprint. And Honda Motor America is enabling in-vehicle payments to parking with additional features and EV use cases to be enabled in the future.\nDigital solutions are also key to migrating [indiscernible] to Debit Mastercard. This conversion drives a better cardholder experience, including in many cases, the ability to shop online and across borders, which leads to incremental card spend. And prior to a full transition, we offer a virtual companion card to the current Maestro Cards for immediate online use. In Europe, we're in the process of sunsetting new issuance of Maestro, and we will continue to work with our issuers on the migration of well over 100 million cards over time [Audio Gap] in the U.S. and Canada, our mobile payment solution is now live with BMO and fintech partner Extend bringing our virtual card capabilities to contactless business payments.\nWe also continue to expand our reach to corporates by partnering with Oracle to embed Mastercard virtual card capabilities into their Fusion Cloud ERP to enable supplier invoice payments and corporate purchases. And we are integrating our commercial payment and open banking capabilities into SAP Fioneer platforms to deliver an embedded payment and lending experience. There remains a significant opportunity to convert cash and check to commercial card products. We're signing deals across the globe to do just that. We're excited to announce that we have agreed a long-term deal with Citibank to forge a global commercial card partnership covering more than 60 markets. The deal extends our leadership position with Citibank and reinforces our efforts to modernize and grow B2B payment flows.\nWe also signed our first ever commercial contract with Axis Bank in India, and a commercial deal with the biggest investment bank in Latin America, BTG Pactual. Now let's focus on disbursements and remittances. With access to more than 95% of the world's bank population, our reach spans more than 180 countries and more than 150 currencies, and we are seeing strong growth.\nIn the third quarter, transactions were up more than 30% on a year-over-year basis. To continue growing in this space, we're expanding into new use cases and geographies. A great example is our partnership with Remitly, one of the fastest-growing digital remittance platforms with over 5 million active users. Remitly will leverage our disbursement and remittance solutions to help make international payments faster, easier and more secure. We're also expanding our collaboration with Paysend in the U.K. to enhance cross-border payments for SMEs. Now our value-add services and solutions are another important driver for our growth. Collectively, this suite of capabilities is fast growing and provides a diversified revenue stream. We have invested thoughtfully to develop services focused on supporting our customers in areas of growing need.\nCybersecurity threats are rising, a trend that will unfortunately persist. And there's an increasing demand for actionable insights and more personalized experiences. Our services, bolstered by our data-driven intelligence can help customers reduce fraud, grow their portfolios and better engage with their end customers. Take our cyber solutions, which protect consumers and the payments ecosystem more broadly, one example is Safety Net, which in the past 12 months has prevented more than $20 billion in fraud. This is just one of our many fraud solutions that we're deploying to deliver more value and support continued growth. AI also continues to play a critical role powering our products and fueling our network intelligence. We're scaling our AI-powered transaction fraud monitoring solution, which delivers real-time predictive scores based on a unique blend of customer and network level insights.\nThis powerful solution gives our customers the ability to take preventive action before the transaction is authorized. This quarter alone, we signed agreements in Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria with financial institutions and fintechs who will benefit from early fraud detection and with merchants who will experience less friction and higher approval rates. In the end, this all makes for a better consumer experience. We're also using our services, combining our data and expertise to help clients optimize and do more with their portfolio. This drives both direct services revenue and incremental payments revenue. Our consulting, marketing services and targeting analytics help clients design and execute portfolio migrations, drive incremental card acquisition and stimulate spend.\nFor example, in Spain, we are working with [indiscernible] to boost the migration of closed-loop clients to our new open loop [ co-badge ] proposition. And we're working with Saudi National Bank to enable growth in their credit portfolio by increasing penetration from their debit base. So the headline for me is the power of our strategy to drive payment network and service revenue for Mastercard.\nService improved the performance of our client's portfolio, leading to incremental payment flows, which lead to more opportunities to use our services and so on and so on, it's a virtuous circle. We also had success in expanding our customer base and services through best-in-class personalization and our leading Test & Learn capabilities. Don't just take our word for it. Gartner recognized the superior value proposition of Dynamic Yield personalization activities and selected as the leader in its 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for the third year in a row.\nThat's why luxury brands like like Saks Fifth Avenue work with us to create hyper-personalized experiences for their e-commerce customer. This quarter, we extended our partnership with the merchant Aldi in both the U.S. and Australia to continue to leverage our Test & Learn platform to optimize category reviews, store hours and marketing spend. And we're working with Dunkin' International to enhance their foundational data analytics capabilities to improve operational efficiencies. Our best-in-class addresse the unique needs of a diverse set of customers, giving us ample opportunity to continue to grow across our value-add services and solutions.\nWe have a strong foundation for growth in P2M as discussed new flows and services, and we are also embracing new opportunities for future growth. As digital adoption continues to rise, open banking remains a key opportunity. We have a powerful set of assets with connectivity to over 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. and 3,000 banks across Europe.\nWe're engaged with a broad set of partners who are increasingly interested in the scale and potential of the open banking solutions we bring. This includes the account-to-account bill payments use case. Our open banking solutions enhance existing ACH flows by providing a simple and secure experience, allowing consumers to seamlessly share data with trusted parties. Previously announced partnership with JPMorgan Payment's Pay-by-Bank is now live and Verizon plans to pilot this offering with the U.S. customers in the coming months.\nIn addition to this, we're now collaborating with Worldpay to enable consumers to pay bills directly from their bank account. Our progress here continues.\nSo in summary, our third quarter results reflect the strong fundamentals of our business and the continued resilience in consumer spending. Their substantial runway supported by opportunities to digitize person-to-merchant payments across both dollar volume of flows and the number of transactions and opportunities to address new payment flows and extend our diverse suite of services all while we continue to invest in future areas for growth. When you put it all together, our diversified business is well positioned for strong growth for years to come. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting resilient domestic consumer spending and strong cross-border volume growth as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a 1 ppt increase from acquisitions and operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 21% and 24%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a net tax benefit, which was primarily discrete due to U.S. tax guidance released in the current period. EPS was $3.39, which includes a $0.09 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $475 million through October 23, 2023.\nSo let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 11% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 5% with credit growth of 7% and debit growth of 4%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 14%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 21% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.\nWhile this is sequentially lower versus Q2, this is due to tougher comps as we lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, as Michael said, cross-border travel remained strong at 155% of 2019 levels in Q3, and cross-border card not present ex travel continues to hold up well. Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 15% year-over-year in Q3, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. We also continue to increase the percentage of transactions we switch. This is strategically important for us as it presents a revenue -- growth opportunity in both payments and services. An example of this is in Japan, where we began switching domestic transactions last September. In Q3 2023, we switched over 65% of our total transactions worldwide. For historical context, this figure was approximately 55% in 2018.\nIn addition, card growth was 7%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the third quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 14% relative to a strong Q3 a year ago. So let me give you a little bit of color. Our Cyber Intelligence solutions continued to grow at a healthy pace, driven by our underlying key drivers and demand for our fraud and security solutions, and we continue to see strong demand for our consulting and marketing services as well as our loyalty solutions which is partially tempered by other solutions.\nNow let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 11%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 26%, while cross-border volumes increased 21%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to mix.\nTransaction processing assessments were up 11%, while switched transactions grew 15%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Our network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $229 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period.\nMoving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, including a 1 ppt impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.\nNow turning to Page 9. Let me comment on the operating metric trends in the third quarter and through the first 3 weeks of October. Starting with switched volume growth year-over-year. We lapped the NatWest migration early in the quarter and the commencement of switching in Japan late in the quarter. These factors are the primary drivers of the sequential declines in both Q3 and into October. One point on the U.S., the sequential drop in October primarily relates to the timing of certain social security payments this year versus last. Switch transactions follow similar patterns. Looking at cross-border, cross-border travel growth is being impacted by tougher comps as we continue to lap the recovery of travel.\nWhen compared to the 2019 index, cross-border travel metrics remained strong. Cross-border card not present ex travel continues to show strength. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from the schedule, excluding activity from Russian issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix. Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on Q4. So let me start by saying consumer spending remains resilient and that our diversified business model continues to position us well for the many opportunities ahead. That being said, [Audio Gap]said, we are closely monitoring the elevated macro and geopolitical concerns and stand ready to adjust expenses should circumstances warrant. Consumer spending patterns continue to normalize post pandemic, while pockets of opportunity remains for further recovery of cross-border travel, notably into and out of China. This will take some time as these corridors continue to face a variety of constraints.\nHaving said this, our base case scenario continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor markets and reflects recent spending dynamics. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year net revenue to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to have a minimal impact to this growth. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar in Q4, foreign exchange is now expected to be a tailwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter as compared to the 3 to 4 ppt benefit we had previously expected.\nThis follows the impact we saw in the third quarter with a stronger dollar led to a foreign exchange benefit of 2 ppt to revenue, down from our initial expectations of a 3 ppt benefit. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of between 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $85 million for Q4. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% in Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Audra, you can open the call up for questions. .",

With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. So, starting with the big picture, our momentum continued into Q2 with net revenue up 15% and operating income up 16%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP, currency-neutral basis. Once again demonstrating the strong fundamentals of our business, consumer spending has remained resilient, with spend on experiences and travel remaining a focus. On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors.\nFirst, the overall labor market remains strong, including wage growth, and consumers continue to be supported by credit and savings. These are key factors of consumer spending. Second, the efforts of central banks to curb inflation are showing signs of progress. Despite this, inflation remains elevated, and we are in a period of tight monetary policy across many countries. Economic growth will continue to vary country by country and sector by sector.\nLooking at our switched volume trends, domestic volume growth remains healthy. We continue to see strength in T and E, with some recent moderation in both inflation and spend. In select international markets, cross-border travel continues to show strength, reaching 154% of 2019 levels in Q2. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this trend with our travel-oriented portfolios as well as in our initiatives in areas like loyalty and marketing.\nCross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to hold up well. We're monitoring the environment closely and are ready to adjust investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these priorities are one, expanding in payments, two, extending our services, and three, embracing new networks.\nFirst, we're expanding in payments by continuing to win deals with a diverse set of customers, powering growth and acceptance, capturing a prioritized set of new payment flows, and exploring new ways to ensure payment choice by leveraging multiple alternatives including cardrails, ACH, blockchain, and open banking. Back to the top of this list, we are winning deals across the globe through a combination of our innovative products, differentiated services, and our solution selling approach.\nI will share a few examples from each region. Let's start in Europe where we announced a significant win with UniCredit across all card products. We expanded our partnership and put in place a first of its kind single card multi-market strategy spanning 13 banks, 12 markets, and 20 million cards. UniCredit selected Mastercard due to our innovative digital capabilities, shared focus on sustainability, and proven ability to support their client needs.\nIn Germany, the previously announced conversion of approximately 10 million of Deutsche Bank's credit and debit cards to Mastercard has now started. These wins build on a prior success in the UK where there are now 16 million NatWest debit Mastercard cards live in market. When combined with the Santander and First Direct migrations, approximately 27 million debit cards have now shifted to Mastercard across these three portfolios in the UK. Turning to North America, Mastercard will partner with Fiserv's Money Network for all US state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs.\nCoast Capital Savings, Canada's largest federal credit union, will be converting their consumer and small business portfolios to Mastercard. The partnership highlights our shared commitment to local communities with issuance through Collabria Financial Services. In addition, we have a new agreement with Tim Hortons, the largest quick service restaurant brand in Canada.\nTim Hortons will launch a new Mastercard credit card and will be using a broad set of Mastercard's digital analytics and fraud services and technologies. Our relationship with Santander in Latin America continues to grow. In Mexico, we established a long-term exclusive deal with Openbank, their new digital bank. We also renewed the Fiesta Rewards co-brand credit card, Santander's key offering within their consumer portfolio. In Brazil, we will be Santander's exclusive partner across their commercial portfolio, and we've expanded our partnership with fast-growing Sicredi, one of Brazil's largest credit unions.\nIn Asia Pacific, we've extended our relationship with Standard Chartered Bank, which will enable us to grow our consumer credit presence across key markets in the region. We've also expanded our partnership with HSBC through the launch of the Travel-1 card in Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Travel1 will provide instant in-app Rewards Redemption powered by the Mastercard rewards system. With all of these cards, people do need a place to use them. We continue to power growth and acceptance by establishing new partnerships and scaling new technologies.\nThis quarter we announced partnerships with both Alipay and WeChat Pay to enable international travelers to easily link any Mastercard credit or debit card to Alipay and WeChat Pay digital wallets. The partnership allows visitors to make payments with tens of millions of QR code merchants across China. I just returned from China where I saw firsthand how this is helping international travelers shop and pay in more places. In a simple way it's like paying like a local and this will be valuable as inbound cross-border travel to China improves from approximately 50% of 2019 levels in Q2.\nIn the online environment, we are scaling our Click to Pay capability to enhance the guest checkout experience. Click to Pay transactions grew over 70% year over year in Q2. Entry technology is now live in 30 markets in the quarter. We added Chile, Bahrain, and Slovakia, and NatWest Group became the first bank in the UK to go live with Click to Pay push provisioning for cardholders shifting to new payment flows.\nWe are making tangible progress in this area. In commercial point of sale, we've extended our partnership with Brex to support the international expansion of their commercial portfolios. We expanded our relationship with myPOS continuing to drive new merchant acceptance across more than 30 European markets while also migrating their small business debit portfolio to Mastercard.We've established an exclusive partnership with Australian lender Grow Finance to introduce credit cards to their small business customers later this year.\nIn B2B accounts payable, we remain the market leaders in virtual card. We continue to drive growth by tapping into new use cases. For example, we established an exclusive partnership with EasyTransfer in Greater China. This competitive flip leverages our virtual card capabilities to support cross-border tuition payments for international students. We're also making it easy for buyers and suppliers to integrate virtual cards into the technology platforms they already use. Building on our prior announcements with SAP and Coupa, we've recently partnered with GEP to integrate our virtual card technology into their payables platform.\nOn the supplier side, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager with Billtrust. The solution streamlines the processing of virtual card transactions for suppliers and automates the integration of reconciliation data into accounts receivable systems. This is a great solution and it builds on partnerships with companies like Boost Payment Solutions who have been working closely with Mastercard to expand and optimize commercial acceptance.\nFinally, in new flows, we continue to deploy our disbursement and remittances capabilities in new ways and across new geographies. In the US, we partner with top sports gaming processor Interchecks who will make Mastercard Send available to gaming operators for payouts. Careem Pay, one of the largest digital wallets in UAE, will use Send to top up their wallets using Mastercard.\nOn the cross-border front, we partnered with Al Fardan Exchange in Qatar to facilitate remittance services and support cross-border travel. Our work in real-time ACH continues to support these new flows. Our historical approach has been to expand our infrastructure reach into new markets. Going forward, we will be focusing on delivering and scaling in the markets we already are serving while building applications and services in these key locations in line with our overall strategic and financial objectives.\nBlockchain, we're introducing the Mastercard Multi-Token Network (MTN). MTN is a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within digital asset and blockchain ecosystems more secure, scalable, and interoperable. We believe in the potential of blockchain technologies. However, regulated money such as bank deposits and CBDCs need to be part of the solution, and they should interoperate with traditional systems. We can help with that. MTN is the natural evolution of the work we have already done in this space. The initial sandbox will kick off in the UK this summer.\nNow turning to services. Our services inform decision making of our customers. They help them create stronger connections and greater loyalty. Payments and services reinforce each other, multiplying our impact and the value we deliver to all our partners. Our services helped drive many of the wins I mentioned earlier. Still, here are a few additional examples.\nWe recently launched our Consumer Fraud Risk Solution which leverages our latest AI capabilities and the unique network view of real time payments I just mentioned to help banks predict and prevent payment scams. AI is a foundational technology used across our business. It has been a game changer in helping identify such fraud patterns. We've partnered with nine UK banks including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Monzo, and TSB to stop scam payments before funds leave a victim's account.TSB, one of the first banks to adopt the solution, indicated that it has already dramatically increased its fraud detection. Since deploying the capability.\nWe're combining our loyalty consulting, analytics, and identity services in different ways to help our customers capitalize on the travel recovery. This quarter we extended our broad-based partnership with Expedia Group. Together we will combine Mastercard's loyalty solution with Expedia's extensive travel supply to enable Mastercard cardholders to book travel using loyalty points. We also partnered with Thomas Cook in India to issue prepaid cards for international travel.\nThe proposition includes cardholder access to over 450 cross-border travel offers through Mastercard Travel Rewards, and earlier this month I met with our partners at Deutsche Bank and Lufthansa and Frankfurt. We resigned our long-standing partnerships with Lufthansa Group for its Miles & More loyalty program and welcomed Deutsche Bank as the new issuing partner.\nIn this enhanced relationship, you'll see a combination of our loyalty solutions, personalization capabilities, and digital user experiences help the partnership take off to the next level. Using airline speak, we're also leveraging our personalization and test and learn capabilities to help our partners across the ecosystem enhance the customer experience and improve acquisition and conversion rates.\nFor example, we combine Dynamic Yield's personalization capabilities with our marketing services to drive digital customer acquisition for Ecobank in Nigeria. In addition, HP Inc. has partnered with us to deploy personalized web content for their consumers across Canada and Europe. On the merchant side, we are working with 7-Eleven Australia using our test and learn capabilities to support the rollout of new store concepts and value its food and beverage offerings.\nOur third strategic priority area is embracing new networks with a focus on open banking and digital identity. We continue to make progress in open banking and establish a series of new and expanded collaborations this quarter, including ones with Freddie Mac, Algoan, based out of France, and Dapi in the UAE. These entities will leverage our smart and consumer permissioned data to drive increased financial inclusion and make digital interactions simpler and safer.\nTurning to digital identity, we're driving adoption across several new verticals including travel, ticketing, retail, and financial institutions. Travel provider FlightHub is using our identity solutions to help travelers book their new next adventure. Sports teams across the US, including the New Jersey Devils, used these solutions to enable fans to buy tickets while reducing fraud on ticketing platforms.\nMajor League Baseball used our NuDetect technology to ensure that All-Star votes were authentic for this year's All-Star Game. In retail, we partnered with IKEA using Ekata to help reduce friction and fraud. Financial institutions like Greenwood, a digital banking platform for black and Latinx communities, are using our capabilities to authenticate consumers in real time, making financial empowerment a reality for more people.\nSo in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth supported by resilient consumer spending, particularly in travel and experiences. Our strong deal momentum continues with new wins and expanded relationships powering our services across a range of partners including UniCredit, Fiserv, Tim Hortons, Brex, and many more. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model, and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. Sachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nThanks Michael. Turning to page three, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel, as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions.\nOperating expenses increased 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions, and operating income was up 16%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 11% and 14% respectively, both reflecting a sizable discrete tax expense this quarter related to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil. EPS of $2.89 includes a $0.22 reduction due to the discrete tax expense I just mentioned and a $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $497 million through 24 July 2023.\nSo let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide, gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 12% year over year on a local currency basis. In the US, GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 8% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the US, volume increased 16% with credit growth of 14% and debit growth of 17%. Of note, we have now completed the NatWest debit migration in the UK.\nOverall cross-border volume increased 24% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q1, this is due to tougher comps as we opened up post Omicron last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, you see continued strength. For example, cross-border travel is at 154% of 2019 levels in Q2, which is up 6 ppt from the prior quarter on the same basis. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels, up 2 ppt from the prior quarter to 210%.\nTurning to Page 5, switched transactions grew 17% year over year in Q2. Both card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents over 60% of all in person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8% globally. There are 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.\nTurning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the second quarter, which came in above our expectations. As a reminder, earlier this year we revised our disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into two new categories, Payment Network and Value-Added Services and Solutions. Now getting into the numbers described on a currency neutral basis, Payment Network net revenue increased 14% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates incentives.\nPayment Network net revenue was higher than anticipated primarily due to higher revenues related to FX volatility and the timing of planned deal activity. Value Added Services and Solutions net revenue increased 16%, primarily due to the continued healthy growth of our cyber and intelligence solutions, driven by our underlying driver growth and the demand for our fraud and security solutions, and strong demand for consulting and marketing services, which was partially offset by other solutions.\nNow let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 11% while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 29% while cross-border volumes increased 24%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.\nTransaction processing assessments were up 16% while switched transactions grew 17%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees were $270 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13% primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.\nNow turning to page nine, let me first comment on the operating metrics trends in the second quarter versus 2019. Overall spending has remained resilient when viewed year over year on a sequential basis. We are seeing some moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets, as well as more difficult comps as it relates to the first three weeks of July. Our metrics are holding up well, generally in line with Q2 when indexed to 2019. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from this schedule, excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix.\nTurning to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals continue to remain strong as overall consumer spending remains healthy, and we continue to deepen our relationships with partners across the globe. Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized post-pandemic.\nCross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to hold up well.\nWhile we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market, and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel for the year. Our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately one and a half ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022.\nForeign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged, with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the year. As Michael mentioned, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth with respect to Q3. Year-over-year, net revenue is expected to grow at a low double-digit rate again on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off a strong Q2, this sequentially reflects a lower anticipated contribution to growth from revenues related to FX volatility.\nForeign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 ppt, and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.\nAcquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 ppt. Other items to keep in mind: first, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $90 million for Q3. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.\nSecond, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18% and 19% for Q3 and Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business and the recent US tax guidance that allows for more tax credits to be claimed related to 2022 and 2023, and with that I will turn the call back over to Devin.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you. Sachin, Audra, we are now ready to begin the question and answer session.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad, please. Only press star one once to queue up for a question, as pressing Star one multiple times may affect your position in the queue. We'll take our first question from Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Good to talk to you guys. Just wanted to ask on the UniCredit win there. That was a nice one. Just outside the top 10 it looks like in Europe. So you mentioned a multi-market strategy is what they're going after, and I heard sustainability also as a reason for the win. I'm just curious thinking about this as a case study; is this a, a new trend? Why are they employing the strategy now? In the wake of all the macro uncertainty, Open Banking, and there's a lot of talk about pan-European schemes and what not. So I just wanted to study this one a little bit, and if there's any comments on timing and pricing as well, thanks.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, Tien-Tsin Huang, thanks for the question. So this is a fantastic win. We're excited about that. As I laid out, it's very unique. This is a pan European bank, so cutting across 13 banks and 12 markets. It's a wide strategy, therefore it's single card, multi-market, and it cuts across a lot of our digital capabilities. So I think the breadth of our offering on the digital-first site, as well as our services, are a key aspect of us winning this particular portfolio.\nThe sustainability part, we see this across a whole range of customers who are all looking at climate as the question of the century to solve what can be done. The consumption question in the context of payments, there's so many angles to it. Our Priceless Planet Coalition on tree planting itself plays into that. So that is particularly important to UniCredit. So, so here again we had a meeting of the minds.\nIn the end, it comes down to, as part of the migration, and you alluded to this in your question, do we stand ready to serve their needs from day one as the migration starts? We have proven this with Deutsche Bank; we've proven it with NatWest, and so forth. So this is something that is not new to us. So we're excited to see this unfold. Over the near future.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThat's great. Thank you, Michael.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my question, Michael. I want to ask about FedNow, which is now finally launched. I know you've commented on this before in very early days and you're far from any sort of ubiquity or potential retail payments use cases. You've had also a lot of experience working alongside real-time payments ways, owning some of them. So how are you thinking about FedNow and the risk and opportunities from after? Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThanks, Harshita. Yeah, we're all monitoring what FedNow is doing. They are now going live. So this is clearly a milestone, a good opportunity to look at this topic again. Our view on this really hasn't changed. So in the end it comes down to what problem you're trying to solve. What are merchants looking for? Merchants are looking for reach to consumers, so scale matters.\nWhat are consumers looking for? Consumers are looking for safe ways to pay in a predictable fashion, ubiquity available. So those are all factors that haven't changed with this launch. We built that acceptance. We have a brand, the two interlocking circles that represent trust. So that addresses a lot of what merchants and consumers are looking for. We strengthened the proposition over contactless, tap on phone, buy now pay later, Mastercard installments, Click to Pay, and so forth. So that's good.\nThe Mastercard debit proposition is strong, and we keep evolving that. So it's well understood now. FedNow is launching. So as we look at that, we will obviously continue to compete and offer our services to our banking and issuing partners at the same time, in our experience. To your question, we have stayed close to these systems in various other countries, in the end ending up partnering with most of them. With most of them. So here we'll have to see where it goes live. Going live doesn't mean that it is broadly available yet, it is early days as you said.\nYou know, it doesn't have features, it doesn't have a consumer platform as such, you can't access it through your mobile banking app. All of that is what our solution today provides. So we have to see where it goes, head-on competition, but a mindset of partnership. Where and where it makes sense for us and where this goes. It is important to say that we do have solutions for these systems.\nIf you look at the Chase Pay by Bank solutions that we put into the market, so that's exactly leveraging these kind of flows that would run across these systems. Generally P2P focused, some non-card penetration verticals run across these particular systems. So we see that as an opportunity, and Chase Pay by Bank will be one of those ways to going after that. We've done similar kind of solutions in the UK, in Europe, and so forth. So more to come. We'll stay very close at this point in time. I think we have the better solution in the market.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nVery helpful, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, KBW\n\nThanks. Good morning. I had a question on these Fed. Routing rules on debit. I guess the card not present transactions went through in July. I'm just curious how you see the opportunity there. It would seem like you're in a. Good position to take some share.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So you know, the clarification came two networks available as of 1 July. So we put that in place, and we said we would, and we're ready to do that. It's still early days. We have to see where that goes. As you rightly said, Sanjay, we stand ready to compete, and you know, that is certainly we will look for the opportunity, and I'm sure we will find it.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, KBW\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to Lisa Ellis at MoffettNathison.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hey Michael, in the prepared remarks you highlighted that with Mastercard's Real Time ACH strategy, you're sort of in a phase of transitioning from building out infrastructure to focusing more on building applications and services. Just kind of taking a step back. You know, it's always been a big differentiator from Mastercard that you own infrastructure in Fast ACH with Vocalink.\nThat's corporate services. Can you just kind of comment a bit on the move over the last, you know, six or seven years? Like how has that helped differentiate Mastercard in the, you know, in terms of being able to capture account to account network payments, you know, new flows, et cetera. Thank you.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThanks Lisa. So real time payments, when the rise of real time payments started, 2016, 2017, and so forth, and we invested into Vocalink, it was clear at the time that we wanted to be in the infrastructure, infrastructure, application services. There was a bit of the logic at the time we needed the street cred and we needed the talent so we can participate in this trend from day one.\nThat was, that was the first season of the movie. So to say, to stick with your analogy, where we are today, we build out an enviable and unique position in real time payments, having a footprint in 13 of the top 50 GDP countries where we run and partially operate real time payment infrastructure.\nOur strategy was we will be in the markets that matter, and we don't want to be in the markets that don't matter. So, we feel we've reached that point, and now it's really to drive up scale and use that infrastructure position. The business in itself of running these systems in these markets is attractive enough. As we pointed out, we're going to focus on building out a set of applications and services. On top of that, you recall from the prepared remark where I talked about.\nThe scam, the anti-scam solution in the UK with these nine UK banks. That's a fantastic example of how our expertise in these markets has positioned us to rally nine banks around the table to come up with a market-wide solution. Now not everything that we will do will be market-wide solutions. There will be individual customer solutions, but we feel we have muscle in this space. It's not going to go away. All these government payment systems out there, more and more real-time payment solutions will come up, and I think we will be in demand because we've done it for a long time. We'll have a seat at the table.\n\nLisa Ellis\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks guys. Could we touch on value-added services for a moment? I mean, it's been a good run for some time. I think it grew just about a point below transactions this time around. You mentioned strength in cyber and some other categories offset by that. We're offsetting others. So I'd be curious to get a little more detail as to what were the strengths and weaknesses of value-added services, now including the other. Then, more importantly, just how much room do you think you have across those different categories to keep that growth alive and cross-sell well into your meaningful payments business?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight, so let me start, and then Sachin can add a bit around the various dynamics around growth rates and so forth. So as I said in prepared remarks, payments and services complement each other. You know, the strategy is a combination of both, and we extend that into new networks. So that's, that's the starting point. We remain convinced that that is a key reason that all those wins I just talked about earlier are happening.\nSo central to our strategy, our services in aggregate continue to grow faster than the core. So we continue to diversify our revenue base. We like that; we want to continue to do that. There's a whole range of services to choose from. We could do lots of things. We have pruned our strategy when it comes to processing because we didn't feel that was such a differentiator.\nWe felt that cybersecurity in a world that is rapidly digitizing is just going to drive the biggest demand, and we're seeing that coming through in the numbers. When I look into our CNI business, which grow at a very healthy clip. If you think about our DNS and data analytics business here, we keep on building out the value chain. It's a vertically integrated value chain where you have test and learn, we have loyalty, and you go all the way into personalization.\nThat is before, after, during the transaction, helping our customers run a better business. I don't see an end to the demand. In fact, that is key to segment diversification strategy. So running at a healthy clip, I don't see any moderation here. This will continue to grow, and you should see us continue to build out across the key aspects of services in cybersecurity and data analytics and side. So we love this business, and we'll continue to nourish it.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nHey Darrin, it's Sachin. Good morning. A couple of additional thoughts. So Michael kind of covered off the strength we continue to see in our value added services and solutions, and that's indeed the case. You got to remember that growth rates move around quarter to quarter on this area, and so we should all focus on the longer term trends out here as it relates specifically to Q2.\nWhen you look at growth rates for value added services and solutions in Q2 of 16%, I assume you're looking at the sequential trend out there. One point to keep in mind is that there was a 1ppt drop in Q2 on account of acquisitions. So Q1 had the impact of acquisitions. Q2 doesn't have it because it kind of lapped that acquisition period. So that's one piece.\nThen specifically in my comments I talked about that the strength in cyber intelligence, as well as in some of our data and services capabilities, was offset by other solutions. It's really all about what the growth rate trends are for cyber intelligence and data and services relative to growth rates and things like real-time ACH, especially on the infrastructure level.\nSo when we talk about other solutions, think about it in the context of things like real-time ACH, which tend to grow at a lower pace there. Historically what we had spoken about was just services; now we're talking about value-added services and solutions. When we think about services in the historical context in Q2, that services growth rate was more like 18%. Just for a reference point for you on that.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood, very helpful, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Timothy Chiodo at Credit Suisse.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat, thank you for taking the question. I want to dig in a little bit on another business that is important to both your volume and your revenue growth algorithm over the medium term, which will be Mastercard Send. You touched a little bit on some of the cross-border use cases. I believe many of the initial use.Cases were much more domestic, but it's evolving over time. Maybe you could just dig in a little bit more to some of the cross-border use cases that are really gaining traction.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nRight. So Timothy, let me start off with that. So our send business, domestic and cross-border together, that's how we look at it. There's a big chunk in there which is cross-border disbursement remittances. As you rightly said. The way that we go after that is by adding new geographies. I gave you three markets that we've added this year, Chile, Bahrain, and Slovakia. So there is tremendous reach, unparalleled reach in what we have in our cross-border proposition, 100 countries around the world. Then there's new ways to go after it, and that is the use cases. So earlier when I was talking about gaming payouts, some of that is domestic, some of that is international.\nThe whole workers remittances piece, Al Fardan and Qatar, those are important corridors. We very specifically go after these corridors, Middle East into South Asia, and so forth. So it's pretty methodical. You know there's another way which I haven't talked about onto how to accelerate this business, and this is how we make it easier for customers. To onboard with us.\nSo Cross-Border Services Express, which is kind of prepackaged solution around cross-border payments, is another way for us to accelerate this business. So new geographies, new use cases, corridor-specific, great methodology. I think we have the right kind of assets here across our HomeSend integration, across, across our Transfast acquisition, the Mastercard proprietary system, and our card reach. So all in, this is growing at a very healthy pace, and we like that business a lot. We are experts in cross-border, as you know, on the card side, and we're building that out here over here in cross-border remittances and disbursements.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nExcellent. Thank you for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go to our next question from Rayna Kumar at UBS.\n\nRayna Kumar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Michael and Sachin, thanks for taking my question. Both of you in the past have discussed how B2B remains a large opportunity for Mastercard. Can you talk about what trends you're seeing in B2B payments in this macro environment, how you're progressing against capturing the TAM, and if you're seeing any slowdown in corporate spending as companies potentially tighten their budgets?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Rayna. I'm noticing a lot of questions coming from me means that there isn't a lot of questions in the numbers, which is fantastic, and I love to talk about B2B. Let me take the lens, Rayna. That's a little bit broader here on commercial overall. So I feel like I'm repeating myself here. We're cross-border payments because they are growing at a healthy clip.\nSo the story for commercial growing at a healthy clip? So this is, you know, we're seeing quarter over quarter, year over year, two-year growth above the consumer side. There's particular strength in our international markets business, and we've sustained elevated levels of growth. When we compare this back to 2019, all the noise of COVID out of it. We have two main focuses in this area. One is commercial point of sale. The other one is our B2B accounts payable business, commercial point of sale. Now, this is a tremendous total market opportunity. Massive TAM out there, and it's lightly penetrated by cards today.\nYou know, the way we look at this is this isn't really about building new systems. This is about penetrating with the tools that we have today, targeting SMEs and corporate T&E purchasing fleet. All of that with our existing capabilities that we have, plus our complementary solutions like smart data and easy savings, and so forth. So a lot of cash and checks out there, a lot of opportunity with cards that we have today. So we leverage that. We build out a separate vertical in the company.\nWe're focusing hot, and we're seeing the growth rewarding us for that. On the B2B side, this is accounts payable, trusted relationships. This is invoice payments and so forth. This is an even larger TAM with a lot of clear pain points. Companies are looking to automate these processes, digitize these processes, get rid of the paper.\nVirtual cards is a solution that works tremendously well. We, as I called it out earlier, we are the leaders at virtual cards, but the solution isn't perfect. So we invest a lot of energy through our product teams to make it better and better. What I was saying earlier on, Receivables Manager, this is a way to automate the acceptance of virtual card payments, build it into the Accounts Receivable system, automate it through, get the benefits of virtual cards without some of the manual processes that we had to go through over the past year.\nSo this is a real breakthrough. This business is going to be hugely important for us going forward. We called it out in November 2021 at our strategy day. It's one of our biggest growth opportunities. We feel we're ahead in the market, and we're seeing the healthy growth, and that will be remaining a focus for us.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good quarter, guys. Michael, since you said Sachin's not getting enough questions, maybe I'll ask a numbers question. Yes. So. I wanted to figure out sort of the cadence of operating expense. You know, Q3 versus Q4. It sort of looks like. It looks like you're kind of exiting the year a little bit higher than the Q3 levels in terms of growth. So what's causing that as well as? You know, I know your cadence of. Spending tends to be longer term in. Nature, but are there product or service? Callouts in terms of the types of investments that you're making, that's most pertinent now.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nHey Ashwin. Good morning. So look, what we shared with you is our thoughts around what we think operating expenses look like in the third quarter, and I've given you what the full year numbers or what our expectations for the full year numbers are. So I think you kind of back into what our operating expense growth rate is going to be or is expected to be in the fourth quarter.\nThere's nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint in Q4. Honestly, I would tell you if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, growth rates, you know, when you back into those numbers, you'll see there's nothing really unusual going on there. Broadly speaking on OpEx, here's what I would say. You know, we continue to remain focused on driving our operating expenses in what matters. It's the strategic priorities.\nIt's making sure we're channeling our capital in the appropriate manner to drive growth both in the short, medium, and long term. That's what we'll continue to do. As you know, we are a people business to a large extent because a lot of what we do from our tech development standpoint is around people. A lot of what we do from a sales standpoint is around people.\nThat's what we invest in. When you see growth rates in terms of operating expenses, I tend to call out personnel as one of the line items essentially for that reason alone, which is the growth comes from people and people are the ones who actually bring the assets that are there for which allow us to deliver that revenue. Really nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint, you know, as we exit the year.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOkay, great, thank you. Yes, we keep top and bottom line growth in mind. You know there is a tremendous opportunity ahead of us right now. So we are using this tailwind that we're currently seeing to continue to invest. You see the list of wins, the growth momentum in B2B, the growth momentum in services. This is the time to continue to nourish that business and invest. You will see us do that in a very prudent and disciplined fashion.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Dan Dolev at Mizuho.\n\nDan Dolev\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. I appreciate it. Just a quick question on the guidance, like you know, obviously results were very strong. You know, you exceeded your second quarter guidance on revenue. Like what was the thought process of not boosting the guidance for the year? Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSo, Dan, a couple of thoughts here. One, again, remember we share guidance in terms of ranges. That's what we've shared out here as well. Right. When you think about ranges, that's what they are, in essence. Point number two is some of the beat which we had in Q2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was driven by what we call timing of deal activity. We still expect to be active in the markets.\nWe still expect to vigorously compete in these markets. So I kind of intentionally mentioned that as timing only because we do expect that as the year progresses we will continue to be active in the market. So I think you should take that into consideration as well. Then my only other comment I'd make is in Q1 we had a modest increase in our thoughts relative to what we had shared right at the start of the year. So when you bring all of that together. Right. That's kind of our thinking behind what we shared from a full-year guidance standpoint.\n\nDan Dolev\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGot it. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Bob Napoli at William Blair.\n\nBob Napoli\n\nPartner and Senior Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThank you and good morning. On open banking, Mastercard's been pretty aggressive in investing in open banking, but I'd just like some additional thoughts and maybe on how that's progressing and then how open banking maybe fits into other strategies like embedded finance and banking as a service.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard",
    "content2": "Right. So, open banking. As you know, we specifically call that out as one of two opportunities in new networks. The trend is here to stay. That's pretty clear. This whole notion of people get to use their data footprint to avail better financial services. There's a lot more regulation coming around that. PSD3 in Europe is coming out. So this train has left the station.\nThat's good. We're on it. The way we look at it is we have to move beyond connectivity. We had a good start. We are well connected here in the US through our Finicity asset and in Europe through our assets. We're very busy now building use cases on top of that. This is where we think the future is going.\nInitial demand over Finicity was very clearly in lending-oriented use cases and asset verification use cases. That feels that is where the demand is today. To Sachin’s earlier point, where do we invest? We invest where we see the demand in the near term. So that is where we're optimizing. You're already starting to see, as we're going beyond these lending use cases with our solutions like our Chase Pay by Bank solution here in the US, this is using a Payment Success Indicator which is using open banking data to tell a biller this is a good time when there is balance on an account.\nPlease. Now Bill, that is what the Payment Success Indicator does. That is powered by Mastercard's open banking technology. So near term use case is clear. That's working connectivity. We're well positioned with our two assets, and we're very busy building out use cases, and obviously we're excited to see payback with Chase launch in Q3 as we said to you.\n\nBob Napoli\n\nPartner and Senior Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nDevin will take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good morning. Cross-border volume growth remains very strong, but on Slide 9, clearly there's a deceleration from April growth through June, especially in cross-border travel. My question is for the second. Harshita, what growth rate and cross-border volume is embedded in your guidance? Then if you go a little bit under the hood, what do you see in cross-border travel volumes? Maybe a little more texture in what you're seeing by country and Europe. You gave kind of overall data and some thoughts on China.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure David. So a couple of thoughts. First, let's start at the highest level, which is the value prop for cross-border travel, still remains incredibly strong. So we've got a strong value prop. We have a strong presence in the market. As you remember, as we were going through COVID, when everybody had stopped traveling, we used that as an opportunity to continue to bolster our position in cross-border, and that's paying dividends right now.\nThe fact that we were building portfolios and winning portfolios at that point in time is helping us actually drive strong growth in cross-border broadly speaking, but also in travel. Now, specifically to your question around trends, I think you're looking at year-over-year growth rates. When you are looking at what the cross-border travel trajectory is month over month, the declines you were talking about, I'd encourage you to look at the right-hand side of Slide 9, which talks about. The numbers indexed to 2019. There you could see actually there's an accelerating trend in cross-border travel. Said differently, you can see that in Q1 our cross-border travel.\nA percentage of 2019 was 148%. In Q2 that was 154%. In the first three weeks of July, that's 157%. The reason that's important is because the year over year growth rates are getting impacted by tougher comps from last year. I think that's important to actually keep in mind. You know, in terms of regional color, I would say that you know, regions are performing well you know, look, I mean, the beauty of what we've got at Mastercard is a diversified business model, is diversified across multiple dimensions, across, you know, payments and services, across products, across channels of sale, across regions.\nThe fact that we've got this presence, strong presence across various regions helps us in the cross border side as well. Really what we're seeing is good sustained growth in cross border both on travel as well as non travel across the globe. We're seeing accelerating trends in Asia Pacific, which we had very much expected and spoken about. That's what you're seeing coming through in the nature of the numbers here. We still think there are pockets of opportunity on a going forward basis. In particular going into China and coming out of China.\nJust as a reference point, Michael talked about how cross-border travel inbound into China stood at approximately 50% of 2019 levels in Q2. That just goes to show what the opportunity remaining there is. Conversely, cross-border travel outbound from China was approximately 70% in Q2. So that both those numbers will give you an indication of where the opportunities lie on a going forward basis.\nAs we continue to do what we're doing in terms of, you know, winning more portfolios, enriching our proposition, layering services such as our loyalty programs, that just helps position us well on a going forward basis. That's the kind of color I'd like to share with you on this. Broadly speaking, I think we're in a very good place as it relates to cross-border.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOne thing to add here, that is the current imbalance in the market between demand and supply. So there's still an unlock there, as in airline capacity, airport capacity, and all of that will unlock. So the combination of the underlying desire to travel, how that trend is coming through, our position, strong position in the travel industry with our portfolios, Expedia and Lufthansa, just to add to here, and this unlock of capacity over time will be a very good mix. This is an exciting space. People just want to be out there.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Dan Perlin at RBC.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, RBC\n\nThanks. Good morning. I just wanted to maybe dig a little deeper on the commentary around this moderation, inflation, and spending, Sachin, that you called out particularly. What can you tell us about kind of the downdraft and average tickets during the current quarter? Then maybe more specifically, are you seeing any discernible signs or indications of trade downs from the consumer that would be high corollaries to slightly weaker consumer spending as opposed to this resiliency that it sounds like you guys are continuing to talk about? Thank you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nSure, Dan. So, couple of thoughts. It's no surprise, I think you guys are all seeing that inflation while still remaining at high levels has started to moderate, right? So you're seeing that come through in terms of the nature of spend, right? We're a nominal value business and the end of the day, right, inflation, declining inflation, quarter over quarter will have an impact.\nSo that was important to actually call out. Then I also talked about how there's a moderation in select markets, international markets. The reality is when you look at markets and this is not broad based, right. There are select markets where, you know, let's take a market like the UK at the end of the day, rising interest rates and high inflation levels ultimately will put a squeeze on people's ability to spend. That doesn't mean that the consumer isn't necessarily resilient.\nThe consumer remains resilient on a more holistic basis. At the margin, what you start to see is, as, say, for example, mortgages get reset. When mortgages get reset, they're getting reset to higher interest rates. What it's doing is it's squeezing the wallet or share of wallet, which would be available for other discretionary categories of spend.\nSo, you know, you're going to see a little bit of that trend come through, which is what we were kind of calling out. All of that's factored into our thinking as we think about the rest of the year, and in my full year guidance. So that's really in essence what we were kind of thinking about. So again, I'll summarize it by saying there's, you know, recent reductions in inflation, and there's a little bit of moderation in select international markets.\nReally we haven't seen this as being broad based. We haven't seen this as something which is, you know, causing concerns for us. It's very much in line with what we've been thinking about from a guidance standpoint. I'll remind you that at the end of the day, cross-border continues to be strong. Back to the question which David just asked. So we kind of bring that all together, right? We feel good about what the strength of the consumer is.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, RBC\n\nExcellent. We have time.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nOne more question and we'll take that.\n\nOperator\n\nQuestion from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Sachin, just want to ask about FX volatility and how it impacts the model. I know cross border assessment revenue growth. Was above volume, so it had a positive yield. I think in your peers one of. Your peers' reports it was actually negative and they called out the lack of FX volatility. Just trying to understand how it impacts Mastercard's model.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nBryan. So first. When we talk about FX volatility, you see that in our numbers and transaction processing assessments, not in cross-border assessments. It is tied to the activity of auth, clear, and settled, which is why it sits in transaction processing assessments. What I called out was the higher growth rate in cross-border assessments relative to volume was driven by what we call favorable mix, which is the fact that our inter volumes, which is everything ex intra-Europe, right, are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe.\nInter volumes tend to be high yielding as compared to intra. That's the reason you had that positive kind of gap between where revenues were on cross-border assessments and where volumes were. Again, the volatility comment I made was tied to transaction processing assessments, which is where it sits.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat.\n\nDevin Corr\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Mastercard\n\nThank you, Michael. Any closing comments?\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, Mastercard\n\nAll right, thanks, Devin. The first thing I want to say, you should all know that Warren sits in the other room and is listening to us. So this is the first time solo, soloed by Devin. We're delighted with this next chapter. Now, as always, I want to make a comment about all the people at Mastercard who make this happen, the 30,000 of us. I sent them a note earlier today with the result that, you know, this is the value that you guys deliver every day. So I just wanted to share that with you. With that, thank you for your support, your questions today, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard\n\nBye bye. Thanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect it."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Inc. Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nMr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer; and Devin Corr, our incoming Head of Investor Relations and my successor. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.\nYou can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.\nOur comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Warren. Good morning, everybody. Another quarter, let's jump right in. The headline is that in quarter 1, consumer spend has remained remarkably resilient, in that, despite continued economic uncertainty. We kicked off the year with strong revenue and earnings growth. Quarter 1 adjusted net revenues were up 15% and adjusted operating income was up 17%, both versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items.\nFocusing on the macro for a moment. Let's take stock, both the positive and negative factors we have been monitoring. First, the labor market in aggregate remained strong, while savings remain above historical levels and consumers continue to access credit, which all are key drivers of consumer spending. Second, central banks continue to combat elevated inflation levels with higher interest rates. Although we are seeing signs of inflation cooling, additional stresses on the banking sector have emerged. We will continue to monitor how banks respond to these evolving conditions.\nAnd finally, economic growth around the globe continues to vary by country and sector. The reopening of China is a positive catalyst. However, the impact of monetary and fiscal tightening in many countries will likely be with us for some time. So overall, many moving pieces, but even so, consumer spending levels have remained resilient, while the mix of spending has continued to rebalance towards experiences.\nLooking at our switched volume trends. Domestic volume growth has remained relatively stable with some recent moderation in the U.S., in part due to lower tax refunds. Cross-border travel in quarter 1 reached 148% of 2019 levels with all regions above 2019 levels. This includes notable improvement in Asia. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. We will continue to watch the environment closely. And as we have demonstrated in the past, we are prepared to adjust investment levels appropriately while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. And as a reminder, these 3 priorities are expanding in payments, expanding our services and embracing new networks.\nNow I've been on the road for much of the quarter, meeting with customers, partners, government leaders and, of course, our teams. These conversations reinforce the energy we have for our collaborative approach and show the importance that many places on digital payments and driving much of today's economic activity. And it's with that in mind that I'll share some examples of how we are progressing against our 3 strategic priorities.\nFirst, we're expanding in payments by winning deals across a diverse set of customers, innovating in and growing acceptance and expanding solutions to address new payment flows. We see our partnership [ even ] with a diverse set of co-brand partners, financial institutions and fast-growing fintechs around the world. This quarter, we had a significant win with Costco Wholesale in Taiwan, the largest co-brand portfolio in the market. The deal is a competitive flip that ensures exclusive co-brand issuance and exclusive acceptance of Mastercard co-brand cards and stores effective in August this year.\nWe also announced our exclusive partnership with Wells Fargo and Choice Hotels to launch their new credit card program in the United States. In the Middle East, we think the renewal with National Bank of Egypt, the largest issuer in the country. And on the fintech front, we renewed our deal with N26, one of the largest neobanks in Europe for Mastercard to be the exclusive provider for issuing and processing services. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with Ualá, one of the fastest growing fintechs in the region to be the exclusive network on prepaid, debit and credit.\nSo we are continuing on our trajectory, delivering another solid quarter of new and renewed wins, an important element of our growth algorithm. Beyond new wins, we are driving growth in payments through the development of innovative solutions like our installment offerings. In Australia, we're scaling our solutions with some of the largest banks in the market, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac.\nProviding the way to pay is central to what we do. So too is making sure people and businesses can use those payment tools when and where they want. Along those lines, we are continuing to drive growth in acceptance, expanding connectivity and trust across all forms of card payments. Our acceptance footprint has now surpassed 100 million locations, effectively doubling over the past 5 years. And that's just the start. Our innovative contactless, Cloud Commerce and Click to Pay solutions give more merchants the ability to accept electronic payments with simple technology connectivity. To us, that's an opportunity to bring more physical and digital transactions onto a common network.\nOver 100 markets have now reached at least 50% contactless penetration, doubled the number 3 years ago. Contactless drives higher consumer engagement and helps to accelerate the secular shift to digital payments by accessing lower ticket size purchases that have historically been cash-based. In quarter 1, our tokenization capability was selected as part of a mobile payments launch in South Korea, enabling a significant number of private label cards for contactless and thereby giving us the opportunity to deliver services on those transactions.\nWe continue to see momentum in Tap on Phone with programs across more than 70 markets globally. We continue to scale, including the Stripe, we announced in quarter 1 that they have enabled Tap to Pay on Android in multiple markets. In addition to helping our partners bring Tap on Phone to market, our Cloud Commerce acceptance technology is now live in Europe. Our Cloud Commerce capabilities make it easier and tricker for businesses of all sizes to accept payments on virtually any device.\nAnd Click to Pay is now live in nearly 30 markets globally, including key markets such as Australia, Brazil, U.K. and U.S. We are partnering with payment service providers like Nexi in Italy to further expand our presence. This is all complemented by our workers' partners to grow acceptance by integrating the payment experience where their customers are. You see that in the social commerce space with WhatsApp in Brazil, enabling consumers to make purchases directly from small businesses right within a chat.\nFurther, we remain focused on expanding our set of new payment capabilities to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows. I'll highlight the couple of areas we are targeting, starting with commercial. We had a strong growth in the space with volumes across our commercial credit and debit products in quarter 1, up 21% versus the prior year on a local currency base. We see substantial opportunity to grow in commercial, particularly with our virtual card and small business solutions.\nWith virtual cards where we are the market leader, one of our initiatives is to integrate our solutions with leading B2B technology platforms. This quarter, we signed a partnership agreement with Coupa to enhance their Coupa Pay solution, which embeds virtual cards to address accounts payable flows.\nOn a small business front, today, only a small fraction of payments are captured on card. We are enhancing the value propositions from programs like Easy Savings, which offers automatic merchant-funded rebates to nearly 40 million enrolled cardholders in over 80 countries. And we are growing by establishing new issuance deals through partners like Galileo in the United States, the Mastercard will be the preferred brand for small business and commercial programs.\nNow beyond commercial, disbursement and remittances flows represent a significant opportunity for growth through geographic expansion, new distribution partners and an expanding set of use cases. In terms of new markets, our gaming use case is now live in Canada and Peru, and we have added cross-border origination to the UAE and Uzbekistan. By connecting with MFS Africa, a leading digital payment company, we have enabled mobile payouts across 10 markets in Africa.\nWe are working with distribution partners like Checkout.com to increase reach to even more customers in Asia and the United States. And we're enabling our cross-border services solutions to small and midsized banks through cross-border services express with this simple-to-use Digital First solution, participating financial institutions can offer their customers the ability to send money or pay vendors across the globe quickly and securely.\nIn terms of expanding use cases, we have enabled cash in at U.S., in Europe and the U.K., facilitating underbanked customers to safely load cash into their accounts from a nonbank location, which can also help drive follow-on card spend. So as you can see, we continue to make broad-based progress in addressing our prioritized set of new payment flows.\nTurning now to services. We love services, where we are focused on growth and resiliency through scaling our existing solutions and adding new capabilities. As merchants, as consumers shift to digital, our comprehensive set of cybersecurity solutions becomes even more critical. For instance, RiskRecon helps an enterprise identify their own cybersecurity vulnerabilities as well as for their ecosystem partners.\nWith our acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks this quarter, we now have a solution to help these customers act on this information. Specifically, Baffin Bay's AI-enabled cloud-based threat protection helps to stop cyber-attacks related to malware, ransomware and DDOS attacks. The acquisition also complements our other cyber offerings, including our simulation and assessment tools as well as our cybersecurity consulting practice.\nYou all are familiar with our comprehensive set of data analytics, marketing and loyalty assets. These are about helping our partners make smarter decisions to drive better outcomes. For example, Agoda, one of the world's fastest-growing online travel platforms in Asia, is leveraging our economic insights to inform their strategic planning. In MediaMarktSaturn, the largest electronics retailer in Europe, is utilizing our Test & Learn capabilities to support the assessment and optimization of new business initiatives. We also continue to make progress signing deals with retail and commerce partners like Hyundai Motors Europe and Puma to utilize our recently acquired personalization platform, Dynamic Yield.\nWe continue to look for ways to combine all these assets to deliver valuable end-to-end solutions. We just announced Element, a suite of applications, which brings insights from Mastercard's data analytics to enrich Dynamic Yield's personalization experience.\nOur third key priority area is embracing new networks where we are making progress in the areas of open banking and digital identity. In open banking, we continue to work with a broad set of banks and fintechs who are interested in its potential across a wide range of use cases. In addition to the Pay by Bank solution to JPMorgan that we announced last quarter, we are working with payment risk and identification company, GIACT, a member of the London Exchange Group to embed a secure account verification solution. Also, Saxo Bank will use our open banking technology for account opening and top-ups in Europe.\nFurther, we are developing capabilities on top of our open banking platform. We have advanced analytics partner with fintech, innovators like upSWOT, Nav, Enigma and GenEQTY to expand to capital with better data for making lending decisions. This is another great example of how our technology supports small business.\nMoving next to digital identity. We continue to see strong adoption of our intelligent identity solutions powered by machine learning. This quarter, we secured a key partnership with Southwest to embed our intelligent identity solutions from Kantar to reduce fraud and friction in digital interactions. Still early stages with open banking and digital identity that we are making progress scaling our technology to new markets and use cases with notable partners.\nSo with that, I will wrap it up. And in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, reflecting a resilient consumer and the continued recovery of cross-border travel. We will continue to watch the environment closely and are prepared to act as circumstances dictate. We see significant opportunity ahead, having now surpassed 100 million acceptance locations worldwide. And our focused strategy, diversified and resilient business model and strong relationships around the globe position us well through economic cycles.\nSachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments.\nNet revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel. Operating expenses increased 12%, including a 2 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 17%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 2%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 4% year-over-year to $2.80, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. Of note, the respective growth rates of net income and EPS were negatively impacted by a low tax rate in 2022 as a result of sizable discrete tax benefits last year.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $2.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $602 million through April 24, 2023.\nSo now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 15% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 16%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 9% with credit growth of 15%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel.\nDebit increased 3%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 6%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 18% with credit growth of 17% and debit growth of 19%. Cross-border volume was up 35% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.\nTurning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q1. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 20% year-over-year in Q1. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents over 58% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 9%. Globally, there are 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nTurning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the first quarter, which were above our expectations. As a reminder, we recently revised our disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into 2 new categories, payment network and value-added services and solutions.\nNow getting into the numbers described on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 10%, which would have been 1 ppt higher if we excluded the Russia-related special item, which benefited Q1 2022. The growth in payment network was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 21%, including a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. The growth was primarily driven by the continued strong growth of our Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, driven by underlying driver growth, higher demand for our fraud solutions as well as the scaling of our identity and authentication solutions. And we saw a healthy demand for our data analytics, consulting and marketing services as well as our loyalty solutions.\nNow let's turn to Page 7, starting with key metrics related to payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 15%. The difference is primarily driven by mix and the underreporting of volumes from sanctioned customers in Russia last year, which accounted for approximately 2 ppt of the variance.\nCross-border assessments increased 39%, while cross-border volumes increased 35%. The both PPT difference is primarily due to fuel mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing assessments were up 14%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to FX-related revenues. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $212 million this quarter. It's important to note that these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period.\nMoving now to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 12%, including a 2 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Operating expenses were higher than expected in part due to personnel costs to support higher-than-expected revenue as well as unfavorable foreign exchange related expenses due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.\nTurning to Page 9. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first 3 weeks of April. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in April. As expected, the year-over-year growth rates are being impacted by 2 opposing factors: one, more difficult comps as we began lapping the effects of Omicron; and two, the lapping of the drag created by the suspension of our operations in Russia in March of last year.\nTo aid in your understanding of the underlying spending trends and eliminate some of the noise induced by the lapping effects, we have also included the metric index 2019 levels on the slide. Let's discuss each of the metrics in turn. Starting with switched volumes. Through the first 3 weeks ago, we grew 17% year-over-year, down 1 ppt versus Q1. This reflects more difficult comps and some modest slowing in the U.S. due to lower tax refunds. This started in March and continued into April. This is partially offset by a 3 ppt benefit from the lapping of Russia.\nSwitched transactions grew 18% year-over-year through the first 3 weeks of April, up 6 ppt versus Q1. This includes an 8 ppt benefit from the lapping of the suspension of operations in Russia. As a reminder, Russia had a relatively low average ticket size, which results in a larger relative impact to this metric.\nIn terms of cross-border, volumes grew 29% on a year-over-year basis, down 6 ppt from Q1. This reflects the continued recovery in cross-border travel as well as the positive impact of lapping the suspension of our Russian operations but is more than offset by a tougher year ago comp as travel surged after the passage of Omicron last year. Cross-border volume is indexing at 171% of 2019 levels in April, up from 168% in Q1.\nTo further assist your understanding of the trends in the business ex Russia, where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix to show all data points from the schedule if you exclude activity from Russian issued cards from current and prior periods.\nTurning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified business model and our momentum with our customers position us well for the opportunities ahead. Consumer spending overall remains healthy, albeit with some recent moderation in domestic spending in the U.S., in part due to lower tax refunds this year. At the same time, as Michael noted, the recovery in cross-border travel continues with inbound travel to all regions now well above 2019 levels.\nWithin Asia, in Q1, China outbound cross-border travel increased to approximately 65% of Q1 2019 levels, while inbound reached 45% on the same basis. As a reminder, China made up 2% of outbound and 1% of inbound cross-border travel in 2019. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario assumes consumer spending remains resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover.\nFor the year, our outlook has improved modestly, reflecting our stronger-than-expected performance in Q1. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to be at a low teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect minimal impact from acquisitions.\nOur expectations for operating expense for the year are unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to have a minimal impact for the year. Again, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth.\nWith respect to the second quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate again on a continual basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off of a strong Q1, this sequentially reflects a tougher year ago comp, lower anticipated FX volatility, partially offset by lapping the suspension of operations in Russia. Foreign exchange and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter.\nFrom an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 growth to be at the high end of a low double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This includes cost of approximately 2 ppt associated with the wind down of our efforts related to the P27 project, given their decision to withdraw their license application in the Nordics. Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt.\nOther items to keep in mind, first, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $100 million for Q2 given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels, which includes a sequential increase due to our recent debt issuance. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18.5% and 19% for both Q2 and the full year based on the current geographic mix of our business.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Warren to begin the Q&A session, I wanted to express my deep gratitude to Warren for the thought leadership, dedication and friendship he has demonstrated over his last 6-plus years at Mastercard.

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Incorporated Q4 and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nMr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, we'll open up the call for the Q&A session.\nYou can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.\nOur comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Let's get right into it. So starting with the big picture. Consumer spending has remained resilient, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. We closed out the year with strong financial results and several notable wins. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 17% and adjusted operating income up 19%, both versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items.\nWhile the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we are keeping a close eye on a variety of positive and negative factors. The broadly resilient labor market with low unemployment and rising wages, coupled with elevated consumer savings levels, are key drivers of consumer spending.\nWe're also tracking efforts by the central banks to curb inflation, along with moderating energy prices and the reopening of China. So still lots of moving pieces.\nFrom an overall consumer spending standpoint, we expect the consumer to be relatively resilient. Spending patterns have largely normalized relative to the effects of the pandemic with the notable exception of China.\nIn terms of switched volumes, domestic volumes in the fourth quarter remained steady relative to 2019 levels with some slight moderation in the U.S. related to lower gas prices recently.\nCross-border travel continued to recover in quarter 4, with inbound travel either flat or up in every region sequentially relative to 2019 levels. As of the first 3 weeks of January, inbound cross-border travel to all regions is now above 2019 levels. We will continue to monitor the economic environment closely. And should the outlook change, we're prepared to move quickly to adjust our spending levels as we have done in the past.\nIn the meantime, we continue to focus on the things we can control. That starts with our 3 strategic priorities: expanding payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. And here are some examples of how we're progressing against each of these.\nStarting with payments. We won substantial new business this quarter. Our innovative products, differentiated services and partnership approach enabled us to secure major portfolio flips, extend relationships and launch new programs with banks, co-brand partners and transit systems around the world. I am very excited about our expanded partnership with Citizens to become their exclusive payments provider across all product portfolios in the United States. They will shift their debit portfolio to Mastercard, and we will maintain exclusivity on credit and commercial. Citizens selected Mastercard based on our digital assets, open banking capabilities and safety and security tools.\nWe have also extended and enhanced our long-term partnership with Citi. It solidifies Mastercard as Citi's exclusive global partner for Citi-branded consumer credit, debit and small business cards. We look forward to continuing to partner to deliver digital initiatives, new technologies and innovative payment solutions together.\nWe've extended our long-standing relationship with Bank of America across their consumer and small business debit and credit lines of business. They're great partners. We're especially proud to continue as the lead brand for all newly issued small business cards.\nAnd our positive momentum with Chase continued this quarter as well. Building up on our recent co-brand, commercial and paper bank partnership announcements, we are excited to announce that we have renewed the Chase Freedom Flex portfolio.\nTurning to the U.K. We recently extended our credit deal with NatWest Group for consumer and commercial. So partnering with [Belvin], a stumble transportation to convert over 17 million closed-loop cards, Mastercards and add 24,000 new acceptance locations across the city. We've partnered with QNB Finance Bank and Trendyol, a large e-commerce marketplace in Turkey, over 30 million customers to launch a new Mastercard co-brand credit product.\nNow an important driver of our success in core payments is our ability to deliver innovation and thought leadership. We are designing and deploying innovation solutions at scale, as a result, are the clear partner of choice for our customers. Three recent examples include our book in installments, tokenization and Click to Pay.\nStarting off with installments. SoFi launched Pay in 4, becoming the first bank in the U.S. to launch within the Mastercard Installments program. SoFi valued the broad acceptance, strong consumer protections and commission-based open banking capabilities that all make Mastercard Installments unique. We've got a strong pipeline for Mastercard Installments and plan to add several additional programs across multiple regions throughout the year.\nTurning to tokenization. We surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions per month. And for the year, we are up 38%. We're currently enabling digital transactions in over 110 countries. Tokenization helps keep the ecosystem safe and secure across a wide range of use cases.\nOne example that I think is particularly cool is the work we are doing with in-car payment. We're working with car manufacturers and fintechs to integrate payments using our tokenization platform and biometric authentication capabilities. Think about the simplicity it brings to paying for gas, tolls, charging or entertainment right from your car. This is a great example of Mastercard working with partners to drive the convergence of the Internet of Things, 5G and addressing consumer demand for cool digital experiences. It also highlights how we're expanding the reach and the value of our acceptance network through new channels to support new use cases. This is just the beginning. Watch for more to come in this space.\nAnd on Click to Pay, we partnered with Adyen to launch Click to Pay on their global payment platform, recognizing the value that it brings to guest checkouts and millions of online shoppers. Adyen joins more than 20 other payment service providers around the world, bringing Click to Pay to thousands of merchants globally.\nNow the focus on innovation and partnership is also a critical part of our strategy to penetrate the prioritized set of new flows that we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day. We continue to make solid progress. Here are some of the examples how we're driving growth in each area.\nFirst, disbursements and remittances. Mastercard Send and our cross-border services capabilities are solving for an expanding set of use cases across multiple geographies. For example, we partnered with social marketplace platform, Poshmark, to enable seller payouts. And for cross-border payments, we've teamed up with Pay Send to broaden our global reach and expand the ability to send international payments across card brands.\nSecond, we're deploying digital capabilities to displace cash- and check-based commercial payments at the point of sale, huge opportunity. In France, we signed an agreement with Societe General to develop their corporate card book. And in South Korea, we partnered with Kakao Bank and Samsung Cards to launch new debit and credit co-brand offerings for small businesses.\nThe third flow is B2B accounts payable payments. Our virtual card capabilities provide an effective digital solution to address the working capital, process efficiency and data challenges that are prevalent in B2B. We are the global leader in virtual card. We're seeing rapid growth in this space. We're bolstering our position through new partnerships and capabilities.\nFor example, we announced plans to partner with Sabre and Conferma Pay to accelerate the use of virtual cards for B2B travel payments. We also signed an agreement with fintech partner, Extend, to offer virtual mobile corporate cards in the U.S. and Canada.\nAnd finally, on the consumer bill payment front, we are focused on deploying market-specific solutions to meet unique needs of consumers and businesses. For example, in Norway, we are powering the eFaktura service, which is used by the vast majority of citizens to pay their bills. In 2022, we hit a milestone as over 200 million digital invoices were sent using eFaktura.\nAs you can see, we're making significant progress expanding in payments, and we are excited about the opportunity in front of us.\nNow turning to the second of our 3 strategic priorities, services. Services provide differentiation and diversification for Mastercard. Our strategy is to leverage our services to drive growth at the core and to expand into new segments and use cases. We're making steady progress on both and have significant opportunity for future growth.\nOur services continue to drive growth in the core as evidenced by our wins and extensions with Citizens, Citi, NatWest and others, as I mentioned earlier. One example of a service that enhances the value of payments is Consumer Clarity. The service provides cardholders with merchant details in digital receipts to reduce disputes, low charge-back costs and improve the consumer experience. We recently partnered with TSYS who will offer Consumer Clarity to over 25 million cardholders in the U.S. and the U.K.\nIn 2022, we signed up over 50 financial institutions and merchant partners for Consumer Clarity, including large issuers like Itaú in Brazil. We're also expanding our services to new segments and new use cases, including governments, retailers, digital partners and financial institutions. This quarter, we partnered with research and consulting firms, including [E4 and Cyma] in Germany, as well as the Barbados Ministry of Tourism and International Transport to provide governments with detailed insights into tourism and retail spending trends. We engage with retailers like Lowe's who are leveraging our Test & Learn capabilities to conduct analytics on their core business.\nWe partner with large fintechs like Monzo in the U.K. to advise on product development strategies. And we are deploying our personalization solutions, which we acquired through Dynamic Yield across a range of retail and financial institutions, including [Carrefour] Argentina, HYPE, (inaudible) to enhance and scale their personalization efforts.\nI'm very encouraged by the continued momentum in our services growth strategy and the differentiation and diversification that these capabilities bring.\nI'll now move on to our third strategic priority, which is embracing new networks, namely open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I'd like to highlight an example of how our open banking capabilities have come together with our other strategic priorities to offer a new solution.\nAs I mentioned earlier, in quarter 4, JPMorgan Payments and Mastercard announced an innovative Pay by Bank solution. Solution utilizes the MasterCard open banking platform to modernize existing ACH payments and allow customers to pay bills from their bank account in a frictionless manner. Pay by Bank offers choice and provides a simple and secure experience of billers and merchants as well as consumers by enhancing existing ACH transactions. This deal is a manifestation of our multi-rail strategy, expands our addressable market by our open banking capabilities and it deepens our relationship with JPMorgan Chase. We're actively working with them to take the solution to market this year.\nWe also continue to make progress with open banking in Europe. Mastercard is connected to more than 3,000 banks and financial institutions across 18 markets to power their open banking efforts. This quarter, we partnered with Secure Trust Bank in the U.K., who will leverage our open banking capabilities to provide safe and convenient ways for their customers to repay retail loans directly from their bank account.\nIn summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, aided by a resilient consumer and the continued recovery in cross-border travel. In payments, we won substantial new business this quarter, including Citizens. We're expanding our differentiated services and embracing new networks, including leveraging our open banking capabilities to power solutions like JPMorgan's Pay by Bank. With all that, we're well positioned for the opportunities ahead. We will manage the business with agility should the macroeconomic outlook change.\nSachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 17%, supported by a resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth.\nOperating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 19%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 16%, which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 19% year-over-year to $2.65, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $590 million through January '23 -- 2023.\nSo let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV (inaudible) by 14%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 14%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel.\nDebit increased 1%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 8% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 7%. Cross-border volume was up 31% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.\nTurning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 8% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 18% year-over-year in Q4. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 56% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3.1 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nNow let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by domestic cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth.\nLooking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 6%, while worldwide gross dollar volume grew 8%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 40%, while cross-border volumes increased 31%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.\nTransaction processing fees were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 8%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 16%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 18%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity.\nMoving on to Page 7. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs.\nTurning to Page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first 3 weeks of January compared to Q4 2022. Each of these metrics, with the exception of cross-border card-not-present excluding travel, were favorably impacted by the lapping of the slower growth that occurred in January 2022 related to the Omicron variant. Switched volumes grew 21% year-over-year, up 7 ppt versus Q4. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 4 ppt versus Q4.\nOverall, cross-border volumes grew 42% year-over-year, up 11 ppt versus Q4, driven by cross-border travel growth of 84% year-over-year, up 25 ppt versus Q4. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, grew 10% year-over-year, up 2 ppt from Q4.\nA couple of administrative notes for your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex Russia, we have suspended -- where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from this schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. Additionally, as the impacts of the pandemic recede, going forward, we will no longer provide operating metric levels as a percentage of 2019.\nTurning now to Page 9. I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. Let me start by saying that I believe that we are well positioned to address the significant growth opportunities at hand. We have established a clear set of strategic priorities and are making steady progress against each of them. This is evidenced by the many wins across the products and services Michael has discussed on this call and over time.\nOn the macroeconomic front, as Michael laid out, we are monitoring a number of both positive and negative factors. We do expect consumer spending to hold up relatively well in this environment driven in part by the strong labor market. It is important to remember that we are coming off a year of strong growth as we lap the effects of the pandemic, and we expect our go-forward growth rates to moderate accordingly.\nFrom a cross-border travel standpoint, most regions have recovered and are well above 2019 levels in Q4. The exception is Asia, where there is still room to improve with the China reopening.\nJust a little further context here. China represented about 1% of inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at approximately 20% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, China represented about 2% of outbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at about 50% of Q4 2019 levels.\nWith this in mind, our base case scenario for the full year 2023 is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year primarily due to the recent strengthening of the euro relative to U.S. dollar. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue to carefully manage our expenses as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short- and long-term growth.\nFor the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind for the year.\nTurning now to the first quarter. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items and reflects generally resilient consumer spending.\nA couple of points to note. Q1 will be the last quarter in which we experienced the lapping effect of our decision to suspend operations in Russia in Q1 of 2022. And we expect cross-border volume growth in Q1 2023 to be elevated as a result of the effects of Omicron in Q1 2022. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 ppt for the quarter.\nFrom an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter.\nOther items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18% in Q1 and 18% to 18.5% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Sachin. Audra, we're now ready for the Q&A session.",

My name is Audra and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Inc. Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.\nYou can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.\nOur comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Let's get right into it. So the headline is that consumer spending remained resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover. With this backdrop, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth through the focused execution of our strategy. Third quarter net revenues were up 23% and adjusted operating income up 27%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items.\nNow the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain. Inflationary pressures have remained elevated and central banks are continuing to take aggressive steps to bring inflation in line. Tensions remain high with the war in Ukraine and the supply of natural gas to Europe is a concern.\nDespite all of this, unemployment rates remain low, wages are rising, consumer savings levels remain elevated and credit is readily accessible. In this setting, overall consumer spending has remained resilient, although we are seeing some shifts in what consumers are buying. Looking at our switched volume trends. Domestic volumes remained steady, showing growth relative to 2019 levels relatively consistent to the second quarter 2022. The trend towards spending on experiences continues. We saw notable strength in airline, lodging and restaurant spend with a shift away from categories like home furnishings and appliances. The current mix between retail, T&E and other categories of spend is now broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels.\nCross-border. Cross-border continues to recover as border restrictions are progressively relaxed. Cross-border travel in the third quarter has reached 124% of 2019 levels. Relative to 2019 levels, most regions are up sequentially, including a notable improvement in Asia. Cross-border card not present ex travel continued to hold up well.\nNotwithstanding the continued strength in consumer spending, we will continue to watch the environment closely, including fiscal monitoring and other policy actions taken in response to events. This will inform our actions as it always has. Should the market outlook weaken, we are prepared to act quickly to modulate our expenses. As we demonstrated during the pandemic, we have the flexibility to respond quickly across a number of levers and will do so while maintaining focus on our 3 key strategic priorities. The focus on these areas will create new opportunities for growth that starts by solidifying our positions and payments, complemented by our differentiated services lines and our expansion into adjacent activities like open banking and digital identity.\nMoving on to some examples of how we are progressing against each of these. First, we are expanding in payments by enabling digital transformation with our customers, putting volume growth, expanding acceptance and capturing new payment flows. There are now over 3 billion Mastercards in circulation supported in part by programs such as our digital-first initiative.\nA digital-first solution starts with the ability for a consumer to acquire and then use a new card digitally in near real time. It's helping customers create a best-in-class digital experience, leading to increased approval rates on average by 2 percentage points, reduce fraud on average by 4 basis points and increase spend per active account on average by 10%. To date, we have launched over 200 digital-first customers around the globe.\nSantander in Mexico, Chase in the U.K., Citibanamex, Hague in Spain and Nubank in Brazil are amongst the latest customers to partner with Mastercard to liver an end-to-end digital-first customer journey. Also, we're driving growth in volume with new and renewed wins across a broad set of partners. In the U.S., we recently extended our exclusive deal with KeyBank's debit, credit, commercial and small business as well as deepened our relationship on services.\nThis quarter in partnership with Chase, we will launch a new co-brand program with DoorDash. This deal further expands our presence in the digital food delivery space. We also went live with the Uber Pro Card and enhanced loyalty and payments experience that will help drivers in Korea save on gas, fees and other expenses.\nIn Europe, we have seen momentum in Italy with (inaudible) securing an expanded deal that includes a credit and prepaid flip as well as securing the current Mastercard portfolio. And in Latin America, we have renewed our exclusivity agreement with Mercado Libre and secured incremental credit share with Banco Scotiabank Colpatria. Overall, another great quarter with notable wins. That shift to one area that is sometimes underappreciated. That is how we are enabling growth in payments by giving people and businesses more places to use the MasterCard.\nWe have added more acceptance locations in the last 5 years than the previous 50, and we have now accepted at more than 90 million merchant locations. The preferential contactless payments that grew over the last 2 years continues. More than half of the in-person switch purchase transactions are now tapped up from approximately 1/3 pre-pandemic. And this trend will be bolstered by the adoption of new technologies such as Tap on Phone. Further, our technology and global reach enable growth and acceptance while helping our partners drive their digital strategy. For example, we have signed with McDonald's to use our gateway capabilities, enabling them to easily offer more solutions to new markets beginning in Middle East and Africa.\nFinally, we're driving growth in payments while leaning into innovation to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows. We continue to make progress in going after flows in the disbursements and remittances space by expanding into new use cases and geographies. For example, in the U.S. gig economy, we signed a new global agreement with Airbnb to facilitate host payouts using Mastercard Send in select markets. We've also expanded with gaming payouts, launching our Gaming Fast payout program.\nTo address account-to-account, cross-border and domestic payments, we have signed a deal with Pagero, a leading global B2B network and solutions provider that provides accounts payable automation to some of the world's largest corporate brands. We're also growing commercial point-of-sale transactions by targeting small business, corporate T&E, purchasing and fleet flows. In the U.S., we announced our exclusive co-brand partnership with First National Bank of Omaha to issue the (inaudible) small business card. This product offers small business owners, industry-leading access to tools, benefits and services with a focus on equitable access to credit, very important.\nWe also continue to target B2B accounts payable flows by expanding access and reach, leveraging our virtual card capabilities. We signed a deal with Marqeta to enable our next-generation virtual card solution Instant Pay. This solution intelligently and automatically sends instant payments to suppliers.\nWe have also signed an agreement with SAP Taulia to integrate our virtual card solutions into Taulia and SAP solutions, enabling their customers to facilitate virtual cost payments. We're also well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel with our Mastercard wholesale travel program. In Bahrain, we signed a deal with Infineon for their online travel agency and travel management company, Volumes. And in Europe, we signed a deal with the fintech Swile while going after B2B travel flows in Europe and Latin America. As you can see, we continue to make steady progress in addressing our prioritized set of new payment flows.\nNow turning to services, where we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth. Our services deliver a diversified revenue stream for Mastercard beyond payments. We accomplished this by adding new service capabilities as well as extending existing service offerings into new and existing customers. There continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity in this space.\nFirst off, we're excited about Dynamic Yield's unique personalization platform, which offers a great example of how we're adding new service capabilities. Since complementing the acquisition earlier this year, we have added dozens of new retail and commerce customers.\nA great example is (inaudible), a German fashion store. I always share German examples, if I can. They have more than 1,400 stores in Europe. We have deployed our content personalization capabilities to additional markets. In addition, we are expanding our capabilities to financial institutions.\nNow beyond adding new services, there's an opportunity to grow by extending existing offerings into new and existing customers. In the third quarter, we signed an agreement with Sky Italia, part of Sky Group, one of Europe's leading media and entertainment companies to enrich and commercialize a new service to support small businesses. Imburse, a technology provider to insurance companies is implementing our card-linked services for their micro savings programs with Generali Insurance in Switzerland.\nAnd in Spain, we have grown our relationship with CaixaBank with one of our largest European Africa deals. The deal enables them to provide a more efficient charge backflow for all the card portfolios. Beyond expanding in payments and extending in services, our third key priority area is embracing new networks.\nAs a reminder, our current focus is on 2 areas: open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I'll touch on open banking. While open banking is early in the game, it is a tremendous opportunity. We are engaged with a broad set of financial institutions and fintechs who are increasingly interested in a wide range of use cases. And what's unique and interesting here is that we are the partner that brings what is needed to scale and it's still confidence in this space, things like responsible data practices, consumer protections and deep compliance, all on top of our robust technical capabilities, broad connectivity and extensive applications.\nSo just to give you a flavor in the U.S., Quicken, a leading provider of financial management solutions has selected Mastercard as a provider of consumer permission data for its popular simplified budgeting platform. We're also working with Fidelity, with their innovation in student loan repayment for organizations that want to help their employees improve their financial wellness. And then there's Jack Henry, which will enable community and regional financial institutions to be at the center of their account holders' financial lines. They will do this providing the ability to securely see all of their financial accounts within and outside the primary financial institution in a single view. This will help enable consumers and businesses to make more informed financial decisions. This is just the beginning much more to come in open banking.\nBefore wrapping up, I'd like to share an example of how we are incorporating our capabilities across all 3 strategic pillars. Our strategy to engage in the crypto economy leverages assets across payments, services and new networks, a combination that yields a truly differentiated value proposition. Here, we're deploying our payment capabilities to enable consumers to spend their crypto holdings on card and cash out their crypto wallets via Mastercard Send.\nThis quarter, we partnered with Ebonex who will become our first partner in Australia to issue crypto-funded cards. We're enabling off-ramp solutions with Mastercard Send and recently added 5 new players in North America and Europe, including Binance supported by Checkout.com and Uber. In all instances, we do not handle crypto, but rather take delivery of fiat currency.\nOur services and new networks capabilities are providing identity, cyber and consulting services for market participants. Crypto Secure is an innovative solution designed to bring additional security and trust to this digital ecosystem by helping card issuers address regulatory risks. We also recognize the interest people continue to have buying and holding crypto through trusted businesses like their banks.\nSo last week, we announced Crypto Source, which is designed to give our financial institution partners access to a comprehensive suite of buy, hold and sell services for select crypto assets. This will be augmented with our proven identity, cyber security and advisory services. To support these upcoming pilot programs, Mastercard is expanding its partnership with Paxos Trust Company to leverage their crypto asset trading and custody services. As you can see, our crypto strategy is bringing together best-in-class capabilities at scale, all built on our core principles of providing strong consumer protections, safety and security.\nIn summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, aided by a resilient consumer and a continued recovery in cross-border travel. We continue executing against our 3 strategic priorities. We have strong momentum with our customers, offering a diverse set of innovative solutions. We will continue to manage our expenses carefully within this macroeconomic environment and our well-diversified and flexible business model positions us well for the future.\nSachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 23%, supported by resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth.\nOperating expenses increased 17%, including a 3 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 27%, which includes 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 22% year-over-year to $2.68, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $505 million through October 24, 2022.\nSo let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 11% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 18%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 10% with credit growth of 20%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 2%.\nExcluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 12% with credit growth of 15% and debit growth of 9%. Cross-border volume was up 44% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.\nTurning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 9% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 19% year-over-year in Q3. Card present and card not present growth rates remained strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia.\nContactless now represents 54% of all in-person switch purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 10% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nNow let's turn to Page 6 for highlights of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 23% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth.\nLooking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 11%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 57%, while cross-border volumes increased 44%. The 13 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.\nTransaction processing fees were up 22%, while switched transactions grew 9%. The 13 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 22%, including a 2 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 26%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity.\nMoving on to Page 7. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, total adjusted operating expenses increased 17%, including a 3 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.\nTurning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first 3 weeks of October. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex Russia where we suspended operations in March 2020, we have included an appendix later in the stack to show all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russian issued cards from prior periods.\nAs a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in October. As expected, the year-over-year growth metrics faced tougher comps as we began lapping periods in 2021 when COVID-related restrictions eased and spending levels started to rebound. However, it is important to note that all metrics continue to hold up well relative to 2019 levels.\nGoing through the metrics in turn, starting with switched volumes. For the first 3 weeks of October, we grew 17% year-over-year, down 1 ppt versus Q3. Switch transactions grew 9% year-over-year through the first 3 weeks of October, consistent with Q3. As a reminder, Russia has a relatively low average ticket size which results in a larger relative impact to this metric.\nOverall, cross-border volumes through the first 3 weeks of October grew 36% year-over-year, down 8 ppt versus Q3. Cross-border travel had another quarter of strong growth as water restrictions continued to be lifted. In the first 3 weeks of October, cross-border travel was up 62% year-over-year, down 11 ppt versus Q3 due to more difficult year-ago comps as I just noted.\nCross-border travel is now at 125% of 2019 levels, up 1 ppt from Q3 levels. Cross-border card not present, excluding travel, was up 12% year-over-year in October, which includes the impact of significant e-commerce promotional activities and is down 1 ppt from Q3. This metric continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels.\nTurning to Page 9. I wanted to share our thoughts on Q4. Let me begin by saying that the execution of our strategic priorities is translating into expanded and deeper customer relationships and the broader adoption of our material solutions and differentiated services. Consumer spending remains resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and cross-border travel continues to recover as border restrictions ease and consumers shift their spending back towards travel.\nJust to update you on some metrics we are tracking. Asia, which represented approximately 14% of cross-border inbound travel pre-pandemic in 2019 is at approximately 76% of 2019 levels in Q3, up from about 60% in Q2. We continue to believe there is more room to grow as several travel corridors, particularly in Asia, still remain restricted and airline industry capacity continues to build back up.\nWe remain well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and service offerings, including access to an extensive airport lounge network and concierge services and our global Mastercard Travel Rewards program, which allows issuers and merchants to connect -- to provide consumers with unique benefits through a simple digital experience.\nAs we have laid out, there are a number of factors that could influence future economic growth. These include elevated inflation and rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions balanced against low unemployment, rising wages and high savings levels in particular. We are monitoring each of these as Michael just said, we are prepared to act quickly to adjust our expenses to reflect any meaningful change to top line growth.\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year net revenue to grow at the high end of a mid-teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This is consistent with prior expectations and sequentially reflects: one, generally resilient consumer spending relative to 2019 levels; two, stable to slightly improved cross-border travel growth relative to 2019 levels with some continued improvement into Asia and some moderation within Europe; three, higher rebates and incentives as a percent of gross revenues due to elevated deal activity consistent with seasonal norms; and finally, the lapping of a strong year ago quarter as border restrictions were lifted in the U.S., U.K. and Canada during Q4 2021.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to have headwind of approximately 6 to 7 ppt for the quarter. As a reminder, the euro has depreciated significantly year-over-year and is the primary driver of this headwind.\nFrom a sensitivity standpoint, based on the current mix of the business, the annual impact of net -- to net revenue of a $0.01 change in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar is approximately $55 million. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expenses to grow at a low double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items.\nAcquisitions are forecast to add about 3 ppt to this growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 4 to 5 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 19% in Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Warren.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sachin. Audra, we're now ready for the Q&A session.",

Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Warren Kneeshaw, you may begin your conference.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone. Starting with the key highlights for the quarter. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth with further improvement in our underlying operating metrics, notably in cross-border travel. Quarter 2 adjusted net revenues were up 27% and adjusted operating income up 40% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items.\nOn the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors that have both positive and negative influences on economic growth. Inflationary pressures have remained persistent, and we are now seeing central banks taking even more aggressive steps to reduce inflation as we have seen with the Fed yesterday.\nThe situation has been compounded by geopolitical tensions and supply chain constraints, which have eased from pandemic peaks but remain in many industries. Despite this, unemployment rates remain low, wages are rising and consumer savings levels remain high. With this backdrop, consumer spending and particularly travel-related spending remains strong.\nLooking at this from a geographic standpoint. U.S. retail spending remains healthy as consumers navigate a high inflation environment. Spending has been aided by strong job creation and the buildup of excess savings during the pandemic. According to our Mastercard SpendingPulse, which is based on all payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales ex auto ex gas were up 6% in the second quarter versus a year ago.\nIn Europe, spending trends are positive, although the risks related to both the supply of natural gas and higher interest rates remain headwinds. Growth in Latin America continues to moderate following a strong rebound in 2021. Asia has generally lagged the recovery of other regions. While COVID-related requirements have been relaxed in several countries, strong restrictions remain in others. Asia continues to have significant upside potential.\nLooking more specifically at our switched volume trends. Domestic volumes continued to show strong growth with notable strength in airline, lodging and restaurant spend. We've seen some shift in spend towards gas and groceries from discretionary categories like home furnishings in the U.S. Cross-border continues its strong recovery as border restrictions continue to be relaxed. Cross-border travel in quarter 2 has now reached 118% of 2019 levels. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continued to hold up well.\nNotwithstanding the strength in consumer spending, we will continue to watch the environment closely, including fiscal and monetary policy responses to high inflation and their potential impact on spending. Within this environment, we will continue to be nimble in managing our expenses. We have the flexibility to respond quickly across a number of levers as we showed in 2020.\nHaving said this, we will continue to invest in the business to drive top and bottom line growth over the longer term. We have well diversified business model, and we are executing against our 3 key strategic priorities: expanding in payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. And here's an update on how we're progressing against each one of those.\nFirst, we're expanding in payments by continuing to grow card volume, driving acceptance growth and leaning into innovation to capture other prioritized payment flows. We're driving growth in card volume with new consumer, small business, co-brand and travel wins globally.\nIn Canada, we're excited to announce that we secured a new partnership with CIBC that creates an opportunity for material share shift for Mastercard with the bank. We also renewed our relationship with the Royal Bank of Canada, including a range of services that will enable us to grow our proprietary and co-brand volumes with them.\nIn the U.S., we established a new partnership agreement with the U.S. Bank, which extends our current debit, credit, co-brand and small business credit programs. It includes several new products, including the first large-scale launch of a consumer credit product, a small business credit offering and the development of Buy Now Pay Later installment solutions.\nWe're excited to announce that we have completed the conversion of Gap Inc.'s existing 10 million card members to Mastercard across the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. We renewed and expanded our co-brand with Brooks Brothers issued by Citi, and we have renewed and expanded our co-brand with Barnes & Noble in partnership with Barclays. Outside of North America, we have secured several new wins and renewals, including a number of deals that position us well in Asia Pacific as the region rebounds from the pandemic.\nIn Australia, we've extended our partnership with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, enabling us to maintain exclusivity with Bendigo and convert several of their regional debit portfolios. We're pleased to announce that National Australia Bank and Mastercard has signed an agreement to retain and grow the Mastercard components of Citigroup Australia's consumer business that was acquired by NAB. This marks the first significant issuing relationship between the 2 companies in years, and we look forward to partnering to grow these portfolios.\nIn Hong Kong, we partner with Citibank and HKT's loyalty program and digital ventures arm, the club, to launch the Citi The Club Credit Card. In India, we're happy to report that the embargo on new issuance has been lifted. Issuers have restarted card issuance and they are eager to expand business with us. An example is YES BANK, where we signed a consumer credit agreement that will enable us to maintain a majority share and includes a commitment to scale our World Elite portfolio.\nWe've worked on to expand our travel-oriented portfolios, which positions us well to capitalize on the strong recovery of travel. For example, in Asia Pacific, we entered into a 10-year commercial card issuance deal with Trip.com, one of the world's largest online travel agencies. In the UAE, we renewed our co-brand portfolio with Marriott. In the U.S., we have renewed our long-standing co-brand relationship with Amtrak, and we've extended our co-brand partnership with Virgin Atlantic in the U.K., a partnership that will leverage our Test & Learn, innovation labs and SessionM loyalty assets.\nWe're also driving growth in payments by continuing to expand acceptance. Mastercard is now accepted in 90 million merchants' locations worldwide, and we have more than doubled the number of acceptance locations over the last 5 years. Mastercard has been driving Tap on Phone innovation, enabling billions of active smartphones to become potential acceptance devices with over 130 deployments across 55 markets. This includes working with Apple to enable acceptance of Mastercard contactless cards and digital payments through the Tap to Pay on iPhone capability. This allows businesses to accept payments directly on their iPhones.\nMastercard is further empowering the ecosystem through our cloud commerce capabilities, which enables our channel partners to quickly deliver cost-effective acceptance. It also provides easy access to a range of payment solutions and services, including Tap on Phone, QR, Installments, Loyalty, data insights and more via the Mastercard cloud. In addition, we continue to drive adoption of our Click to Pay online guest checkout capability. Click to Pay is now enabled in over 20 markets across all regions, and transactions have been growing over quarter.\nWe're expanding in payments through innovations like Mastercard Installments. Our open loop buy now, pay later program has been very well received. Mastercard's Installment is now soon to be live, with Saudi National Bank and several new partners adding their support to the program. Examples include Cross River Bank, Evolve Bank & Trust, Jifiti, Live Oak, MOCA Financial and WebBank in the U.S. as well as HSBC, NatWest and JPMorgan's payments division in the U.K. In addition, Apple recently announced Apple Pay Later, which uses the Mastercard Installments program.\nFinally, we're driving growth in payments by leaning into innovation to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows, including disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, B2B accounts payable and consumer bill pay. This is at the heart of the investments we've been making to develop a range of capabilities that span cards, account-to-account payments, push payments and blockchain. We're at various stages of scaling our capabilities across these different flows, and we're making steady progress. For example, we are expanding network reach through new cross-border services relationships with partners like Doha Bank and Vodafone in Qatar, and UPT, a leading money transfer operator in Turkey.\nWe are targeting specific use cases and scaling distribution through B2B partnerships with Mastercard Send. A few examples, Caesars Sportsbook will leverage Send for instant payment of online winnings, and Paysafe will integrate Mastercard Send into their payments platform to enhance the payout capabilities offered to their merchant customers in the U.K. and the EU.\nNow turning to services. Our service capabilities have proven to be a tremendous growth driver and differentiator for our business, build on a foundation of investments and experiences built over the years. Looking forward, we continue to see a significant opportunity for services in 3 primary areas. First, services will continue to enhance the value of payments. Services make payments intelligence safe and secure.\nFor example, our Identity Check payment authentication service is driving double-digit improvements in approval rates. We are working with Postepay in Italy to support the deployment of their issuing portfolio, assist in growing their acquiring business and enhance the customer engagement approach. Now our consulting team in Europe is engaging with ING to help them create a seamless payment experience for their clients.\nSecond, we see the needs of our customers expanding beyond payments. We can leverage our full suite of differentiated services to address these needs. A recent example is Travelodge with utilizing our Test & Learn capabilities to support optimization of new investments in their business.\nAnd third, our services can be deployed to support new networks, making our open banking and digital identity propositions even stronger. With these adjacent networks, it's our services that will enable us to establish a differentiated position to scale and win. For example, we recently launched a new Biometric Checkout Program. The program outlined a set of standards from banks, merchants and tech providers, helping to ensure the security and privacy of personal data when people pay with a smile or with a wave.\nNow beyond expanding in payments and expanding in services, our third key strategic priority area is embracing new networks. As a reminder, our current focus is on 2 areas: open banking and digitalized entity. We're leveraging our Finicity and Aiia acquisitions to expand our open banking footprint, grow our customer base and deliver new solutions.\nThis quarter, we expanded our Engage partner network to include our open banking services with new fintech partnerships, including Dwolla, Synctera, i2c and others. They can now use our open banking capabilities to easily build and implement solutions for their end customers across a range of use cases from lending to payments to financial management. In addition, we recently launched a global Start Path Open Banking program. This program enables us to co-innovate with start-up fintechs like Dapi, Finantier, mmob, Mono and Paywallet as we support their path to scale.\nWe've expanded our open banking product offering as well. We announced Pay by link in Europe, which allows businesses to send payment requests through invoice, e-mail, SMS or social media chat. This can expedite the payment of invoices in a cost-efficient way, enabling both parties to better manage cash flows. Online accounting provider, Visma Dinero is using Pay by link to simplify invoice payments for over 75,000 small- and medium-sized businesses.\nAnd in the digital identity space, Ekata continues its strong performance, signing over 200 new deals in expansion since we acquired the company just over 1 year ago. This includes many of the leading buy now, pay later and crypto companies. It also includes real-time payment software providers like ACI Worldwide, who's leveraging Ekata's capabilities to help their global merchant network more accurately identify fraudulent transactions. Open banking and digital identity are attractive and growing opportunities, and Mastercard is uniquely positioned to be successful in both.\nSo in summary, our business fundamentals remain strong. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth again. We're executing against our strategic priorities in payments, services and new networks. We have fortified our strong position with travel-oriented portfolios to capitalize on the continued recovery in travel.\nOn the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors influencing economic and spending growth. And with all of that, we will continue to manage our expenses carefully. That said, we will also continue to invest in the business to drive top and bottom line growth over the longer term.\nSachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on currency-neutral basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments.\nNet revenue was up 27%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 12%, including a 5 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 40%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 40% year-over-year to $2.56, which includes a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $448 million through July 25, 2022.\nSo now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 14% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 19%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 10% with credit growth of 25%, reflecting the recovery of spending on travel.\nDebit declined by 2%. Excluding the impact of a roll-off of a customer agreement, debit increased by 1%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 16% with credit growth of 19% and debit growth of 13%. Cross-border volume was up 58% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvements in travel-related cross-border.\nTurning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 22% year-over-year in Q2. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9%, if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card comp. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nNow let's turn to Page 6 for the highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 27% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth.\nLooking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 13%, while worldwide GDV grew 14%. Cross-border volume fees increased 61%, while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to (inaudible) geographic mix. Transaction processing fees were up 22%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 10 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing.\nOther revenues were up 23%, including a 3 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 23%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Note, rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue is higher relative to Q1 2022, primarily due to volumes and related revenues generated from a sizable customer in Russia in Q1, with no related incentive agreement on such volumes.\nMoving now to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 12%, including a 5 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as unfavorable foreign exchange-related expenses due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.\nTurning to Page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first 3 weeks of July. For your reference, to help you understand the trends in the business ex Russia, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in July. Going forward, however, the year-over-year growth metrics will face tougher comps as we begin lapping periods when COVID-related restrictions eased and spending levels started to rebound.\nGoing through the metrics in turn, starting with switched volumes. For the first 3 weeks of July, we grew switched volumes 18% year-over-year, down 3 ppt versus Q2. Switched transactions grew 10% year-over-year through the first 3 weeks of July, down 2 ppt from Q2. Overall, cross-border volumes through the first 3 weeks of July grew 54% year-over-year, down 4 ppt versus Q2. Cross-border travel had another quarter of strong growth as border restrictions continue to be lifted.\nIn the first 3 weeks of July, cross-border travel was up 89% year-over-year, down 55 ppt versus Q2 due to more difficult year-ago comps, as I just noted. Cross-border travel is now at 126% of 2019 levels, up 8 points versus Q2. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, was up 16% year-over-year in July. The increase of 9 ppt compared to Q2 reflects a reduced headwind from crypto purchases and the timing of significant e-com promotional activity between the periods. This metric continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels.\nTurning to Page 9. I wanted to share our thoughts on the remainder of 2022. Let me start by saying that we have strong momentum with our customers. We continue to enhance our product and service offerings and that our business fundamentals remain very strong. Consumer spending remains robust and cross-border travel has improved more quickly than expected as border restrictions ease and consumers increase their spending towards travel.\nAnd there is more room to grow as some borders remain either restricted or have yet to recover to historical levels of growth. For instance, based on our switched volumes, Asia, which represented approximately 14% of cross-border inbound travel in 2019 is only at approximately 60% of 2019 levels in Q2. Similarly, the U.S., U.K. and Canada, which represented approximately 20% of cross-border inbound travel in 2019 is at about 110% of 2019 levels, still well below the historical trajectory.\nSpecifically, if inbound travel to these 3 countries had continued to grow at the historical 3-year CAGR through (inaudible), we would have expected to be at approximately 135% of 2019 levels rather than approximately 110%. We are well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios.\nAs Michael mentioned, there are a number of macroeconomic factors that could influence future economic growth: employment and wage levels, consumer savings levels, persistent and elevated inflation and rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions in particular. We are monitoring each of these, but on balance, expect a modest improvement in cross-border travel versus 2019 levels and a generally resilient consumer spending through the remainder of 2022.\nTaking this all into account, including our well-diversified business model, we are increasing our expectations for net revenue growth for the full year 2022 to a low 20s rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 5 to 6 ppt for the year primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. It is worth highlighting that this performance is despite the cessation of our Russian operations in Q1.\nFor the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This reflects continued investment in our people and strategic priorities as well as impacts from FX-related expenses primarily due to remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add about 4 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 to 4 ppt for the year. We are prepared to quickly adjust our operating expense base as we did in 2020 should circumstances dictate.\nWith respect to the third quarter of 2022, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a high-teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Sequentially, this reflects continued strong consumer spending, including a modest improvement in cross-border travel spending trends relative to 2019, reduced FX-related revenues as a result of lower anticipated FX volatility, and finally, the lapping of a stronger year ago quarter as the recovery took hold last year.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 7 to 8 ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 operating expenses to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 5 ppt to this growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 5 ppt for the quarter.\nOther items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of between 19% and 21% in Q3, which includes a discrete tax item related to an unfavorable court judgment, the details of which we are still assessing. We expect a tax rate of approximately 19% in Q4.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Sachin. Julie, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session.",

Good morning, everyone. Russia's invasion of Ukraine marked a somber start to 2022 as war returned to Europe for the first time in decades. Given these extraordinary circumstances, we decided to suspend our business operations in Russia. We did not take this decision lightly given that Mastercard has operated in Russia for more than 25 years. We are now focused on the orderly suspension of business operations in Russia and supporting the well-being of our employees and their families across the whole region.\nEven in the context of this challenging geopolitical environment, we're off to a strong start in 2022. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth with further improvement in our underlying operating metrics, notably in cross-border travel.\nQuarter 1 adjusted net revenues were up 27% and adjusted operating income up 40% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On the macroeconomic front, consumer spending remains strong, particularly as economies across the globe continue to reopen and pandemic-related restrictions are lifted. Labor markets are firm with low unemployment rates and rising wages. Weighing against this healthy backdrop are a number of factors that they are monitoring, including inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and COVID with infection rates. We're monitoring these developments, including the Cisco, monetary, public health care and other policy responses.\nLet's look at this from a geographic standpoint. U.S. retail spending remains healthy, aided in part by the buildup of excess savings during the pandemic. According to our quarter 1 spending pulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales ex auto, ex gas, were up 4.7% versus a year ago.\nIn Europe, spending trends are positive, although the invasion of Ukraine has introduced risks to economic growth looking ahead. Growth in Latin America continues to moderate following a strong rebound in 2021. Asia has generally lagged the recovery of other regions. We're seeing several countries relaxing COVID-related restrictions, while others are facing stronger measures. Asia continues to have significant upside potential.\nLooking at Mastercard spending trends. We continue to see strong growth. Domestic switched volumes or strength across a broad range of sectors, including retail, utilities and professional spend. We also saw strong growth in travel and entertainment, including spending with airlines, travel agencies, lodging and restaurants.\nIn terms of cross-border, where the growth was particularly strong, the recovery continued this quarter led by travel. Cross-border travel reached 2019 levels as of March for the first time since the pandemic began. Geographically, the cross-border recovery has been broad-based with improvement across all regions. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to be strong.\nOur strategy is designed to enable and capitalize on these trends and we're executing against our 3 key strategic priorities: one, expanding in payments; two, extending our services; and three, embracing new networks. Here is an update on how we're progressing against each of those.\nFirst, we're expanding in payments by continuing to grow card payments and leaning into innovation and new payment technologies to catch up other prioritized payment flows. We're driving growth in comp payments through new consumer, small business, co-brand and fintech wins. On the consumer and small business front, I'm excited to announce an enhanced partnership with Wells Fargo, which includes several new elements. Wells Fargo will now issue Mastercard small business credit cards and for the first time in almost a decade, consumer proprietary and co-brand credit products.\nWe're also excited to announce that we have deepened our relationship with our long-standing partner, Capital One. In addition to renewing our existing business, we will also be their issuing network for a larger number of new originations across both their consumer and small business products.\nFurther on the small business front, we are expanding our small business portfolio with First National Bank of Omaha. We're also partnering with the bank and Verizon to launch a new Verizon business Mastercard targeting Verizon's small business customers. In total, these partnerships will help us continue growing our U.S. small business market share.\nOutside the U.S., we're driving commercial card growth through new partnerships with leading B2B tech companies like Clara. We will be flipping Clara's business portfolio in Mexico to MasterCard and are working for them to launch new programs in 5 additional markets across Latin America.\nTurning to co-brands. We've made substantial progress to ensure we are well-positioned to capitalize on the return of travel. We have renewed and expanded our exclusive partnership with American Airlines, one of the largest co-brand programs in the United States. American will continue to leverage our capabilities, including SessionM and will participate in our [star-powered] program to identify new tech partners who can help drive innovation across the airline.\nAnd in the U.K., we have launched 2 new Mastercard Avios cards with Barclays and International Airlines Group, Loyalty. Outside of travel, we've expanded our relationships with leading retailers, including a new co-brand program with Victoria's Secret and a renewal of our Ulta Beauty co-brand offering, both in partnership with [Red Financial].\nWe're also continuing to advance our leadership in the digital and fintech space through new product launches and new partnerships. We're partnering with BCA Digital, the digital banking arm of the largest private bank in Indonesia, to launch a digital-first Mastercard debit product catering to millennials.\nAnd in Latin America, we signed a regional partnership with global payment processing platform, Galileo. The partnership establishes Mastercard as Galileo's preferred partner across several markets in Latin America, and they will work to integrate and distribute several of our products and services to help their fintech customers.\nIn addition to driving new wins, we are leveraging our services capabilities to execute against many of the large portfolio migrations that are in flight. In Europe, our consulting teams are engaging with our partners at Santander, NatWest and Deutsche Bank to ensure a smooth and timely transition and to identify opportunities to optimize those portfolios.\nSantander is the bulk of the way through a 9 million card migration and we expect it to be complete by early next year, while NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard at the end of last year and plans to migrate their entire 16 million card portfolio by the middle of 2023. Deutsche Bank's $10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued as Mastercard-branded cards with a credit migration starting in quarter 4 of this year and a debit migration commencing early next year.\nSimilarly, our team in the U.S. is supporting key migrations, including Gap Inc., Merrick Bank and First Interstate Bank. All the migrations are on track with Gap Inc.'s scheduled to be completed this summer.\nWe're also expanding in payments by leaning into payments innovation in areas like installments and cryptocurrencies. Here are a few examples. Our [open-LEAF] Mastercard installments program has been very well received and is progressing according to plan. Remember, Mastercard installment is built into our network, making by Buy Now Pay Later available to millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nWe continue to add a wide array of new lender and fintech partners, including Amount, Deserve, i2c, Lithic and Sutton Bank. In this quarter, we announced several merchant partners who are excited to support Mastercard installments, including Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, H&R Block, Saks Fifth Avenue and Walgreens. U.S. customers will begin offering Mastercard installments to consumers this quarter, and international expansion is planned for later this year.\nAnd we continue to build solutions to support the crypto economy with a principled approach focused on 3 key areas. First, helping consumers easily and safely purchase cryptocurrencies and NFTs. In addition, we are enabling consumers to spend their crypto holdings on card and cashing out their crypto wallets via Mastercard Send. Second, providing identity, cyber and consulting services for market participants, including engaging with central banks as they design and develop central bank digital currencies. Third, preparing our core network to directly support digital currencies.\nMaking substantial progress in each of these areas. This quarter, the Gemini Mastercard, which offers crypto rewards went live across the U.S. We're also fond of its Nexo to launch a new crypto card in Europe, one that uses consumers' digital assets as collateral to back their credit line. And we established several other international Crypto Card partnerships, including banks in Europe, and Abra, Invesco and Belo in Latin America. On the crypto services front, MercadoLibre will be leveraging CipherTrace's AI and cyber capabilities to bring security and trust to their digital wallet in Brazil.\nNow turning to our second strategic priority, services. As I've noted before, our services support can differentiate our core products and have played a critical role, enabling many of the wins I mentioned. We also continue to extend our services across multiple growth vectors through new payment platform capabilities, new verticals and new use cases.\nHere are a few examples. First, earlier this month, we completed our acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Now that the transaction is closed, we will combine Dynamic Yield personalization platform and decision engine within our SessionM loyalty platform and our test-and-learn experimentation software. The result will be a truly differentiated consumer engagement and loyalty hub for our customers.\nSecond, we announced that we're expanding our consulting services into 3 new practices dedicated to Open Banking and Open Data, crypto and digital currencies and ESG. We've seen increased customer demand and a growing portfolio of successful engagements in these areas. For example, we are supporting Handelsbanken and Intesa Sanpaolo design programs that advance their ESG priorities. We're helping Wirex explore innovations in crypto.\nAnd finally, we're expanding the breadth of our customer base and deploying our capabilities to solve for a wider range of use cases. For example, we deployed our test and learn capabilities to help tailored brands optimize retail operations and improve marketing efficiency for the leading menswear brands. And we deployed our fintech capabilities with Santander in Spain to help streamline dispute resolutions and improve the customer experience.\nBeyond expanding in payments and extending in services, our third key priority area is embracing new networks. Our current focus is on 2 areas: Open Banking and Digital Identity. Our Open Banking and multi-rail strategies are converging, enabling us to leverage our unique set of assets to address new flows in verticals like rent payments. For rent payments, the risk of ACH returns due to insufficient funds is a significant pain point in both renters and landlords. To address this challenge. We're launching a new suite of smart payment decisioning tools. These solutions use Finicity's open banking capabilities to recommend the optimal payment day and payment rail for each transaction based on cost, speed and risk.\nThe Bill Payment Alliance, a collection of more than 2 million rental homes will be one of the first fintech partners to launch these capabilities. And we plan to expand these solutions across a broad range of bill payment verticals.\nIn addition, we continue to extend our open banking reach with Finicity and Aiia by penetrating new verticals and establishing new partnerships. We continue to enhance our capabilities at the mortgage vertical and are now expanding into the auto lending vertical.\nWe're leading the way in terms of provisioning permission-based income, employment and asset verification information, and we've partnered with Stripe, who will be using our open banking capabilities for a variety of use cases. We're also extending our open banking reach through data access agreements with partners like Fiserv, which will enable direct API connectivity to thousands of FIs in the United States.\nIn the Digital Identity space, in contrast, continued its strong performance in quarter 1, securing deals with financial services companies, including Moneyline and several leading Buy Now Pay Later providers. In addition, we recently joined forces with Microsoft on a collaboration to improve digital transaction approval rates and reduce fraud. The solution enables issuers to optimize authorization decisions using network and merchant-specific authentication data.\nCombined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction and into new digital transactions. These are attractive and growing opportunities, and we are uniquely positioned to be successful in both.\nIn summary, our business fundamentals remain strong, and we delivered robust revenue and earnings growth again this quarter, which also reflects our disciplined approach to expense management. We're executing against our strategic priorities, notably expanding our share with key issuers. In addition, we've worked hard to expand our travel-oriented portfolios which positions us well to capitalize on a strong recovery in cross-border travel.\nAnd last but not least, we want to reflect on what is most important. The safety and well-being of our employees and their families who have been impacted by the war. Our thoughts are with them and the people of Ukraine.\nSachin, over to you.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments.\nNet revenue was up 27%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 2 ppt to this group. These revenues were above expectation, primarily due to stronger-than-expected cross-border and domestic volumes, favorable cross-border mix and FX-related revenues.\nOperating expenses increased 13%, including a 6 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 40%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 61%, which includes a 20 ppt benefit due to the recognition of a one-time discrete tax benefit related to a U.S. tax regulation published in the current period and a 1 ppt decrease from acquisitions.\nEPS was up 65% year-over-year to $2.76, which includes a $0.36 contribution from the one-time discrete tax benefit and a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $599 million through April 25, 2022.\nSo let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Of note, data related to sanctioned Russian banks was not reported to us and hence, such amounts are not included in Q1 2022.\nIn the U.S., GDV increased by 14% with credit growth of 31% and debit growth of 1%, reflecting the recovery of credit spending on travel and the lapping of stimulus. Outside of the U.S. volume increased 19% with credit growth of 20% and debit growth of 18%. Cross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 50% and other cross-border volumes up 56%, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, cross-border volume was above 2019 levels for all regions and cross-border travel was above 2019 levels for the first time in March.\nTurning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 22% year-over-year in Q1 and were at 150% of 2019 levels. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions.\nWith respect to card counts, as a result of the suspension of our business operations in Russia, cards issued by Russian banks are no longer active on our network and are therefore excluded from our card counts this quarter. Accordingly, card growth was lower at 4% this quarter. If you exclude Russian-issued cards from current and prior years, card growth would have been 9%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nNow let's look to Page 6 with our highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 27% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 ppt to this growth.\nI'd also like to point out that in the first quarter, the suspension of business operations in Russia had a minimal impact to the overall growth rate of the company as the loss of volume was offset by a one-time benefit of lower rebates and incentives due to the absence of a customer incentive agreement renewal in Russia.\nLooking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 21%, while worldwide GDV grew 17%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily due to unreported volumes from Russian-related sanction customers and a favorable mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 57%, while cross-border volumes increased 53%, both ahead of expectations. The full ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.\nTransaction processing fees were up 27%, while switched transactions grew 22%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable cross-border mix and FX-related revenues. Other revenues were up 20%, including a 7 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 30%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. As a percentage of gross revenues, rebates and incentives were lower than expected primarily due to the absence of a planned customer incentive agreement renewal in Russia, a higher mix of cross-border revenues and the timing of new internode deals.\nMoving to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 13%, including a 6 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 7%, primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing, higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs.\nTurning to Page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first 3 weeks of April. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex Russia, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods.\nGoing through the metrics in turn. Starting with switched volumes. For the first 3 weeks of April, we grew 23% year-over-year, down 4 ppt versus Q1, primarily due to the cessation of activities in Russia. If you exclude Russia-related volumes from the current and prior periods, switched volumes grew 27%, down 1 ppt versus Q1.\nSwitched transactions grew 14% year-over-year through the first 3 weeks of April, down 8 ppt from Q1, again, driven primarily by the absence of Russia-related transactions. Of note, Russia has a relatively low average ticket size, which results in a larger relative impact to this metric. If you exclude Russia-related transactions from the current and prior periods, switched transactions grew by 25% year-over-year, up 1 ppt versus Q1.\nOverall, cross-border volumes through the first 3 weeks of April grew 60% year-over-year, up 7 ppt versus Q1. Excluding Russia from the current and prior periods, cross-border volumes through the same period grew 65% year-over-year, up 13 ppt versus Q1.\nSince the end of January, cross-border travel has rebounded quickly as border restrictions continue to be lifted and we distance ourselves from Omicron. In the first 3 weeks of April, cross-border travel was up 179% year-over-year, up 38 ppt versus Q1. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, was up 5% year-over-year in April, a decrease of 8 ppt compared to Q1, reflecting in part the lapping of a strong comparable period a year ago. One point to emphasize is cross-border travel is now above pre-pandemic levels at 110% of 2019 levels.\nTurning to Page 9. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of 2022. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to grow our customer relationships and expand our product and service offerings. As Michael mentioned, consumer spending remains robust, particularly as economies open further and pandemic-related restrictions are lifted. Having said this, we are monitoring a number of factors, including inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and COVID infection rates. At this stage, we have not seen any significant impact of these in consumer spending.\nCross-border travel is recovering rapidly as border restrictions ease. This is occurring faster than our earlier expectations. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios. Weighing against these positive trends are the impacts of the war in Ukraine and the suspension of our business operations in Russia.\nSo now taking all of this into account, we continue to expect net revenues for full year 2022 to grow at the high end of a high teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. So essentially, we are maintaining our growth expectations in the same range as the strong cross-border travel recovery and strength in consumer spending helped mitigate the loss of sizable revenues in Russia and Ukraine.\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 3 to 4 ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we are reducing our forecast for the year to reflect cost savings related to Russia. All year, we expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 4 to 5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 2 to 3 ppt for the year.\nWith respect to the second quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a high teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects closely strong consumer spending, including continued improvement in cross-border travel spending relative to 2019; secondly, the discontinuation of revenues from Russia and a sequential reduction in revenues related to Ukraine; and finally, the lapping of a strong year and a good quarter that was aided by fiscal stimulus and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions as vaccination programs rolled out. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 5 to 6 ppt for the quarter.\nFrom an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 4 to 5 ppt to this growth, including the acquisition of Dynamic Yield, which we are pleased to have just closed. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 to 4 ppt for the quarter.\nOther items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates and our recent debt issuance. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year based on the current geographic mix of our business.\nBefore closing out, I want to briefly comment on our 3-year performance objectives for 2022 to 2024. Clearly, the elimination of Russia-related revenues and the reduction of those from Ukraine create a headwind to achieving these objectives. If this would continue, it would result in a headwind of approximately 2 ppt to our net revenue CAGR.\nHaving said this, we are off to a strong start in 2022 with the recovery of cross-border travel ahead of expectations, as I previously mentioned. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth for the company. And net-net, it is really too early to adjust our 3-year performance objectives as we work to offset some or all of these headwinds.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Sachin. Jemiria, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session.",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 and Full Year Mastercard Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Jemiria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.\nYou can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.\nOur comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reform amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\n\nMichael Miebach\n\nCEO, President & Director, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone, from New York. I'm starting off with the key highlights for the quarter.\nWe delivered strong revenue and earnings growth as we saw further improvement in our underlying operating metrics. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 28% and EPS up 46% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On the same basis, quarter 4 net revenues are 19% above pre-COVID levels in 2019.\nSo with that, let's take a look at the macroeconomic front. The outlook remains positive despite the recent supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and inflationary pressures. Although there has been a recent surge in COVID cases, there are signs that these may be peaking. By each of these areas, merit monitoring, underlying spending trends remain strong as consumers, businesses and governments have become more adaptable to a changing environment.\nIn the U.S., economic growth remains solid with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence. According to our quarter 4 SpendingPulse report, which is always based on all payment types including cash and check, guest retail sales ex auto, ex gas were up 6.4% versus a year ago and up 10.9% versus 2019. In Europe, GDV growth has been strong, although recently impacted by mobility restrictions. If the impact of the Omicron variant reduces, we expect the economic growth to pick up in the coming quarters, in large part, thanks to considerable pent-up demand from the past year. SpendingPulse shows that overall European retail sales in quarter 4 were up 3.3% versus a year ago and up 1.3% versus 2019.\nIn Asia Pacific, vaccination rates continue to improve, and we expect the economic recovery to pick up pace as both government and businesses ramp up investment. The travel recovery in Asia Pacific has lagged that of the rest of the world and has significant growth potential. The growth in Latin America is expected to moderate a bit following the rebound in 2021.\nAs it relates to COVID specifically, there are early signs that the Omicron will be relatively short-lived. The reality is that the tools we have to deal with the pandemic are more advanced than ever. 60% of the world's population is now at least partially vaccinated, effective therapeutics are becoming available, and governments are using more targeted measures to limit the spread. More have opened and have stayed open despite the recent variant. Although we've always said the path forward will not be linear, there are signs we are moving towards the endemic phase of the disease.\nLooking at Mastercard's spending trends, switch volume growth continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. Both consumer credit and debit continued to grow well.\nTurning to cross-border. The recovery has continued with overall quarter 4 cross-border levels now higher than those in 2019. Cross-border travel continued to show improvement relative to quarter 3 levels, aided by border openings in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. While Omicron has had some recent impact on cross-border travel, we continue to believe that cross-border travel will return to 2019 levels by the end of this year. Cross-border card-not-present spending ex travel continued to hold up well in the quarter. So overall, the spending trends are moving in the right direction with some near-term travel-related headwinds as a result of the variant.\nNow turning to our business highlights. As outlined at our investment community meeting in November, we remain focused on our growth, diversified build strategy and our 3 strategic priorities, which are expanding in payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. Here's an update on how we're progressing against each of those priorities.\nFirst, we're expanding in payments, a growing person to merchant payments, scaling across other payment flows and leaning into innovation in new payment technologies. In aggregate, these targeted flows represent $115 trillion in opportunity. First off, we're driving growth in person to merchant payments through new wins across the globe. In the U.S., I'm excited to announce that we're partnering with Chase and Instacart, a leading online grocery platform in North America on a new Instacart Mastercard co-brand program. This partnership marks an additional co-brand win with Chase, quickly following the recent launch of the Chase Aeroplan World Elite Mastercard.\nIn addition, with First Interstate Bank's planned acquisition of Great Western Bank, we will flip Great Western's consumer debit, credit and commercial portfolios to MasterCard. And I'm happy to note that the consumer credit portfolio of Merix Bank, over 3 million customers will transition to Mastercard beginning in the second quarter. Merix Bank plans to leverage several Mastercard solutions, including our fraud prevention, consulting, open banking and loyalty services.\n(inaudible) in the Netherlands, we've renewed our partnership with Bank, which includes the migration of 8 million Maestro cards to debit Mastercard. We signed an exclusive deal with Westpac in Australia for the new Banking as a Service platform. This platform will allow new players to leverage Westpac's banking capabilities. Afterpay, the first partner on the platform will connect debit Mastercards to their money by Afterpay app. And in the U.K., the Net West debit migration is progressing to plan as in the early stages of consumer rollout.\nWe're also expanding in payments by capturing new payment flows, including commercial, B2B accounts payable, bill pay and cross-border remittances. For example, in the commerce space, we've expanded our relationship with Bank of America, where we'll be the lead brand for new commercial card issuance. We've also renewed and expanded our relationship with WEX, including the chosen as their strategic partner, and adding open-loop functionality to their millions of closed-loop fleet cards.\nFor accounts payable, we continue to scale Mastercard tracks, WEX, BMO, BOK Financial, Melo and the Connect to the Platform. We also launched the launch -- we also announced the launch of Mastercard Track Instant Pay, which uses machine learning to analyze and initiate automatic virtual card payments, streamlining processes for buyers and improving cash flow for suppliers.\nAnd we're driving new B2B acceptance through a global partnership with Boost Payment Solutions with an initial focus on expanding the use of commercial card in 7 key markets. We're addressing new payment flows in consumer bill payments as well. We recently announced the acquisition of Argus to help deliver bill pay solutions and other real-time payment applications in Latin America. Argus enables digital payments for the majority of households built in Mexico and its connections with banks, fintechs and digital wall providers across the region.\nAnd finally, we continue to capture new flows in cross-border remittances. This quarter, we established a partnership with Travelex in Brazil, who will use Mastercard's cross-border services, send P2P transfers to the U.S. and Europe.\nFor domestic disbursements in the U.S., we partnered with fintech processor, TavaPay, to make Mastercard Send easily available to fintechs and merchants across multiple use cases.\nNow shifting gear. We're also expanding in payments by leaning entertainment innovation in areas like installments, contactless acceptance and crypto currencies. Here are a few examples. Our open-loop Mastercard installment program that we announced last quarter has been very well received. The U.S. launch is on schedule for quarter 1. We're actively bringing new partners into the program as we announced in the Middle East, Africa earlier this week, watch this space.\nNow we're making great progress in expanding contactless acceptance by turning the world's billions of active smartphones into potential acceptance devices, enabling people to buy and sell whenever, wherever they want. We now have 100 deployments of (inaudible) form in over 50 markets with leading partners globally. Contactless penetration increased to 1 and 2 of our in-person switch transactions globally this quarter. This is up from approximately 1 and 3 prior to the pandemic. And with that, the potential for accelerated acceptance growth, financial inclusion and consumer convenience is substantial.\nWe're also bringing capabilities, experience and reach to help enable the crypto ecosystem. Our new collaboration with Coinbase will allow consumers to use their Mastercard to purchase NFTs, try that myself. Our work with consensus will make it easier for software developers to increase the scale, efficiency and speed of transactions on Ethereum and commission blockchains.\nAnd our CPC Sandbox Test Platform, which we launched in 2020, continues to gain traction. We're helping central banks, financial institutions and fintechs simulate the issuance and distribution of along with the integration of CBDDs with our card network, our real-time payment modules and native blockchain wallets.\nNow shifting to services. Our services support can differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in having many of the ones I just mentioned. The group services revenue at 25% in 2021 on a currency-neutral basis. We will continue to extend our service capabilities to enhance the value of payments. We even further accelerating our growth by expanding into new areas and new use cases, particularly through our Data & Services and Cyber Intelligence propositions, again, a few examples for you.\nIn December, we announced an agreement to acquire Dynamic Yield from McDonald's. Dynamic Yield uses enhanced AI to deliver customized product recommendations, offers and content to consumers. Their customer set includes over 400 global brands ranging from financial services companies like Synchrony to retailers like Lens End. When combined with SessionM's loyalty platform and our Test & Learn experimentation software, we will be able to offer a unified consumer engagement and loyalty hub to our customers. McDonald's is a great example of a company who's using all 3 of these platforms today with plans to further scale and integrate Dynamic Yield's capabilities globally.\nIn addition, our Ethoca platform continues to experience strong traction in preventing unnecessary chargebacks, a real pain point. We added new customers in every region in 2021 for Ethoca. Recently, we launched Ethoca Consumer Clarity, which gives consumers detailed information about purchases on their mobile banking app. Submission is live with issuers across the U.S., U.K. and several European markets, including OTP Bank, Central Cooperative Bank and Paybox Bank.\nNow beyond expanding in payments and extending in services, our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks. Specifically, we are leveraging our expertise and payments to build out new networks for the current focus on open banking and digital identity.\nOn the open banking front, we have closed the acquisition of Aiia in November, which brings strong API connectivity to over 2,700 banks across Europe. And combined with Finicity's North American connection, which covered more than 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. market, Mastercard has an unparalleled footprint in the key open banking regions, upon which we are building solutions to solve a wide range of these cases. One example is in the mortgage verification space, where Finicity has signed deals with several new partners, including loan people.\nAnd in the digital identity space, we're helping our customers with fast, frictionless identity verification services. Ethoca has performed strongly over the last quarter, expanding through strategic partnerships with companies such as ZIP and Equifax as well as growing its global footprint with leading frac providers Tongon and Air Click in Asia Pacific.\nCombined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction. These are large, attractive and growing opportunities, and we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both.\nSo in summary, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter. The macroeconomic outlook remains positive with a few areas of the monitoring, and we're executing against our 3 strategic priorities: spanning and payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. And all that with substantial progress on the product and deal front this quarter.\nNow Sachin, over to you and the numbers.\n\nSachin Mehra\n\nCFO, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael. .\nSo turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 28%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 37%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions.\nNet income was up 44%, which includes no impact from acquisitions as the impact of acquisitions on operating income was offset by a onetime acquisition-related tax benefit. EPS was up 46% year-over-year to $2.35, which includes a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $528 million through January 24, 2022.\nSo let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 23% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 23% with debit growth of 15% and credit growth of 4%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 23%, with debit growth of 25% and credit growth of 20%.\nTo put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at 125%, up 4 points quarter-over-quarter with credit at 116%, up 5 points sequentially and debit at 134%, up 3 points sequentially.\nCross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 45% and other cross-border volumes up 63%, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border as several borders opened during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, cross-border volume was 109% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at 122% and other cross-border volume at 98% of 2019 levels.\nTurning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 27% year-over-year in Q4 and were at 132% of 2019 levels. Card-present growth continued to improve while card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In addition, card growth was 9%. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.\nNow let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 28% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth.\nLooking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 24%, while worldwide GDV grew 23%. Cross-border volume fees increased 61% while cross-border volumes increased 53%. The APPD difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.\nTransaction processing fees were up 28%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 27%. Other revenues were up 30%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly delivered by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 38%, in line with our expectations, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new internode deal activity.\nMoving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 12%, primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing, higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs.\nTurning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. First, as a point of process, we continue to provide volume and transaction metrics both on a year-over-year and as a percentage of 2019 basis. However, it is important to note that as we turn the calendar and move into 2022, the index versus 2019 metric now looks back 3 years and therefore includes a compounding improvement relative to the 2021 index metric. This accounting impact must be taken into consideration when considering the sequential trend from Q4 to January.\nSo at the highest level, Omicron has had a minimal impact on overall switched volumes and transactions and has called some moderation on cross-border panel. Going through the metrics in turn.\nStarting with switched volumes. Through the first 3 weeks of January, we are now at 149% of 2019 levels, up 13 points versus Q4. This increase is primarily driven by the compounding effect I just referred to. After adjusting for this compounding effect, switched volumes are tracking similarly to what we saw in Q4. The underlying trends in switched transactions adjusted for the compounding effect are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes.\nIn terms of cross-border volume growth, as I mentioned earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 in Q4 are now above pre-pandemic levels. The Omicron variant, which hit partly through December, impacted the strong cross-border travel momentum we saw in November. That impact has carried over into January. This has been partially offset by an increase in cross-border card-not-present ex travel. Overall, cross-border volume through the first 3 weeks of January is now at 116% of 2019 levels, up 7 points versus Q4. In this case, the compounding effect is partially offset by the impact of the Omicron virus on cross-border travel in January.\nTurning to Page 9. I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. While there is some uncertainty related to Omicron and potential future variance, our overall expectations for 2022 are positive. The macroeconomic outlook is for continued growth and domestic spending levels have come up well despite the recent surge in cases. The recovery in cross-border travel was progressing well prior to Omicron and we expect the recovery in cross-border travel to resume as the surge passes.\nAs Michael just noted, the tools available to deal with the pandemic have improved with time. And although the path forward may not be linear, there are signs we are moving towards the endemic phase of this disease. Many countries have relaxed their border restrictions and we continue to expect cross-border travel to recover to 2019 levels by the end of 2022. Our recent deal wins, travel-oriented portfolios and diversified set of services position us extremely well to capitalize on these trends.\nTurning to our expectations for the full year 2022. Our base case scenario is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a high teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 1 to 2 ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we continue to carefully manage our spending as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short- and long-term growth. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 4 to 5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year.\nTurning now to the first quarter. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a high teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects some sequential improvement in cross-border travel spending trends within the quarter relative to 2019 as the impact from Omicron starts to recede as the quarter progresses. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 to 3 ppt for the quarter. From an operating (inaudible) currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special lines. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 6 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter.\nAs a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year-end which it closed and the subsequent year after which time we do not split them out. For instance, Finicity, which closed in November of 2020 is now folded into the base. We are pleased to have closed the acquisitions of both Aiia and in November anticipate closing the pending acquisition of Dynamic Yield in the first half of 2022.\nOther items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business.\nWith that as a backdrop and turning now to Slide 10, I would like to update you on our 3-year performance objectives for the 2022 to 2024 period that we first introduced in November at our Investment Community Meeting. The bottom line is that there is no change, although our jumping off point for earnings is slightly higher due to our Q4 2021 overperformance. As a reminder, these objectives are on a currency-neutral basis, exclude special items, gains and losses on equity investments and acquisitions closed after 2021.\nUsing 2021 as our base over the 2022 to 2024 period, we expect to deliver a net revenue compound annual growth rate in the high teens. This assumes an annual target market volume growth rate of 10% to 11%, cross-border travel returning to 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and doing our services revenues at a 20%-plus CAGR. From an operating margin perspective, we will continue to operate with the philosophy of delivering a minimum annual operating margin of 50%.\nHaving said this, I would like to emphasize that we continue to believe that it is important for us to invest with a long-term growth while delivering positive operating leverage, and we continue to dive with this philosophy in mind. And finally, we expect to deliver an EPS CAGR in the low 20s range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the impact of special items, in and losses on equity investments and future acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\n\nWarren Kneeshaw\n\nEVP of IR, Mastercard Incorporated\n\nThank you, Sachin. Dermira, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session.",

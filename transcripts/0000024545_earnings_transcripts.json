With that, I'll hand it over to Traci Mangini, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nTraci Mangini\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, ChannelAdvisor Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Our discussion today includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. For more information, please refer to the forward-looking statements disclosure in our earnings release. In addition, the definitions of a reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. Please note that with the exception of earnings per share, all financial metrics are in constant currency when referencing percentage changes from the prior year period.\nWith me on the call today are Gavin Hattersley, former Chief Executive Officer, who retired October 1, but remains with the company on an advisory capacity until year-end. Rahul Goyal, Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer. Today, Gavin would like to share some opening remarks before passing to Rahul to provide an initial high-level view of his vision going forward. Tracey will then wrap up with a brief review of the quarter and our 2025 outlook.\nA more detailed presentation of our quarterly performance, including financial and operational metrics and drivers available in our earnings release and earnings slides, which are made available earlier today on the IR section of our website. Upon the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. And as always, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question, and then if needed, return to the queue. With that, I'll pass it to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Tracey, and hello, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. I am pleased to be here today for what is my last earnings call with Molson Coors. It has been an incredible journey, and I could not be prouder of this team and the strong foundation that we have built. This includes our iconic brands across the world, our leading capabilities from supply chain to marketing and dramatically improved balance sheet and our strong free cash flow generation.\nAnd while I'm retiring during a difficult time in the industry, I am confident in the company's ability to return to growth. So with that, it is my great pleasure to introduce Rahul who took over the role of CEO on October 1. During my 6 years as CEO, I worked closely with Rahul, his deep strategic insights, institutional knowledge, fresh perspectives and proven ability to deliver, which are particularly important in these dynamic times make him in my view, the right choice for the job. And while he has only been in role for about a month, he has certainly hit the ground run and to share more about this, I'll pass the call to Rahul.\n\nRahul Goyal\n\nPresident, CEO and Director\n\nThank you, Gavin. It has been a true privilege to work with you for so many years, and I look forward to building on our many accomplishments and continuing to support the strong culture you have built that makes Molson Coors so special. Now clearly, these are dynamic times, and we like many staples companies have been affected by macro-related factors that have pressured consumption behavior. In the U.S., these macro impacts have had a disproportionate effect on the lower income than Hispanic consumer.\nAnd within there, these consumer segments have driven a reduction in the number of buyers as well as -- with a continued shift to singles in the third quarter. In Europe, the macro environment has also contributed to continued industry softness, pressuring demand across our regions. But we continue to believe that the incremental softness in the industry this year is cyclical, and we believe that we are well positioned with a healthy balance sheet, strong free cash flow and great brand that serve a wide range of consumer occasions and preferences.\nThis all helps us to navigate these near-term cyclical headwinds while investing in our business to support the long-term growth. I know everyone is eager to hear more about -- for the future, and there will be more details to come. Today, I would like to provide a high-level view of our strategic priorities and how we plan to adapt in these challenging times, improve our commercial performance, capitalize on opportunities and ultimately return to top and bottom line growth. I want to assure you that we are moving with a sense of urgency and with a clear purpose.\nIn my first 30 days, we have already begun to implement structural changes, both in terms of leadership and operations to put us on the path to success. At the highest level, it begins by focusing on our portfolio to build strong and scalable brands in both beer and beyond beer. This entails prioritizing our investments to build on the strength of our core and economy per portfolios and to transform our above premium beer and beyond beer portfolio. In beer, we already have a strong core portfolio with iconic global brands and regional market leader.\nThey are the majority of our business. So we intend to continue to put strong commercial pressure behind that. For Miller Lite and Coors Light, this means new campaigns and high-profile sports and music alliances that build on their strong brand health and support ambition for share growth for these brands. And for Banquet, we can to capitalize on its impressive success by leading in even more to fuel its strong momentum and to continue to bridge the sizable distribution gap with Coors Light. Recall that Banquet is only in just over half the buying outlets of Coors Light and not only is Banquet, an important growth driver in our U.S. business, but it offers learnings that we believe can be applied more broadly across the portfolio.\nWe also plan to selectively increase our focus on certain economy brands like Miller High Life and Easton Life, which are big brands with loyal consumer base. We firmly believe that all price segments matter. And while as an industry, we are not seeing trade down at the brand level in today's environment, more than ever, economy is an important segment. And we continue to see big opportunities in above premium. While we have had strong premiumization success in markets outside the U.S., we meaningfully under-indexed in above premium in the U.S., and we plan to lean in even under to change that in both beer and beyond beer.\nIn beer, it's no secret that we think Peroni has great potential. It's only been 2 quarters since we fully onshore Peroni and activated our commercial plans and we are already seeing good progress with brand volume up 25% in the third quarter. And with expected increases in media investment next year, including programming for the Olympics and with only about 1/3 of the distribution of the other major competitors, we see significant runway ahead. We also remain committed to stabilizing Blue Moon and to be frank, we haven't seen the success we would like.\nRecent innovation with non-alc and high ABV brand extensions have been encouraging, while the core Blue Moon Belgian White continues to be challenged. We are going to be looking closely with a fresh commercial perspective at what we can do differently to best ensure that this big and important brand supports our premiumization objectives. Now while beer is our roots and at the core of our business, you can also expect us to step up our focus on beyond bear because we believe we can win here. Not only does it help to premiumize our business that it also creates value for our customers by appealing to a wider range of consumer preferences and serving more occasions.\nIn flavored alcohol, we already have big brands, and some have been rechallenged recently. But Topo Chico is a great example of how with the right commercial road, we can improve trends by focusing investments on the markets where the Topo Chico brand most strongly resonates and through thoughtful innovation, we achieved positive dollar share gain in the third quarter in these regions. And we recognize we have debts, including RTV spirits, and we intend to fill that. In non-alc, we are focused on building scale, and we are off to a great start. We believe our partnership with Fever-Tree in the U.S. provides a strong base from which to grow our total non-alc portfolio.\nIn fact, Fever-Tree volume has been performing strongly, and it has been very well received by distributors and retailers, and we are excited by the opportunity to significantly in the brand in the years to come. And this is just the beginning of our non-alc efforts, as we see opportunities to enter some other interesting areas. So we are making the infrastructure investments in people and systems that help to support the development of this business into something meaningful over time. Now to achieve our commercial ambitions, we are taking a fresh look at our approach to commercial execution and that opportunities to optimize our cost structure to fuel reinvestment in the business.\nOn the commercial side, creating value for our customers and consumers remains at the forefront of all that we do. but we believe we can be even more effective at this by focusing ownership of this business even closer to the market. And we intend to do this by deploying marketing and G&A investments based on specific market dynamics and portfolio priorities. This should help to increase our speed of decision-making our agility to execute and ensure greater accountability and return-oriented mindset at the local level of our business. On the cost side, as announced last month, we are implementing a corporate restructuring plan of our Americas business unit designed to create a leaner, more agile organization while advancing our ability to reinvest in the business.\nThis entails reducing our Americas salaried headcount by approximately 400 positions or 9% by the end of the year. This includes hundreds of salary positions that were already open due to headcount for transition efforts earlier this year and those who indeed granted voluntary severance as part of this restructuring. We intend to redeploy some of these savings to step up our investments behind key brands, commercial capabilities and in supply chain and technology that support ongoing productivity inefficient. And we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital, using a dynamic capital allocation approach, balancing investments in M&A to fill portfolio gaps, while continuing to return cash to shareholders.\nWe'll be sharing more on capital allocation in the near future. But today, let me be very clear on 2 things. First, we seek scalable deals that we expect to be accretive to both top and bottom line and are prudent from a balance sheet perspective. And second, we remain committed to our dividend and to our share repurchase program as we continue to view our stock as a compelling investment. Now there is a lot of work to do, but we see a clear path forward. Results will take some time, but we are moving with a sense of urgency. We're confident we have the right brands and the plans to be successful. And I look forward to updating you on more of the details of strategy and financials and operational objectives in the coming months.\nWith that, I will pass it to Tracey, who will talk about our financial performance and outlook.\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nChief Financial Officer, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Rahul. Third quarter consolidated net sales revenue was down 3.3%. Underlying pretax income was down 11.9% and underlying earnings per share was down 7.2%. On an underlying basis, the key quarterly drivers were largely as expected. The U.S. beer industry was down minus 4.7% based on our internal estimates. Our U.S. volume share was down 40 basis points based on our internal estimates including relatively better share performance in the on-premise channel compared to the off-premise. Contract brewing was a 450,000 hectoliter or 3 percentage point headwind to the Americas financial volume.\nExcluding contract going, U.S. STWs outpace STRs resulting in a nearly 2 percentage point benefit to Americas financial volume in the quarter. EMEA and APAC volume continue to be pressured across all regions by ongoing soft market demand and a heightened competitive landscape. The Middle East premium remained innovative, which was within the expected price range, although at the higher end. And marketing was up, while G&A was down largely due to lower incentive compensation as compared to prior year. While our discussion today as typical has been on an underlying basis, we also recorded a noncash partial goodwill impairment charge of $3.6 million as well as noncash intangible asset impairment charges of $274 million in the quarter, which I'll discuss in detail in today's earnings release and 10-Q.\nI also wanted to address the execution of our share repurchase spend during the quarter. Restrictions under our policies have prohibited us from executing under the repurchase plan during the open trading window following last quarter's earnings because we were in possession of material nonpublic information regarding our CEO search. We expect our regular quarterly trading window to open tomorrow, and we want to stress that we remain fully committed to our share repurchase plan and continue to strongly believe our stock is a compelling investment. With that, let's discuss our outlook.\nWe are reaffirming our 2025 guidance, but we now expect to come in at the low end of the prior range is our key metrics. These key metrics and ranges are as follows: Net sales revenue to decline 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. Underlying pretax income to decline 12% to 15% on a constant currency basis, underlying earnings per share to decline 7% to 10% and underlying free cash flow of $1.3 billion, plus or minus 10%. Now before we get into the details, I remind you that the impact of the global macro environments are multifaceted and difficult to predict. And while we have included in our guidance, our best estimate of some of these factors, external drivers that significantly impact our actual results, either up or down.\nStarting with the top line, we now expect lower year-end U.S. distributor inventory levels. Year-to-date, U.S. STWs largely caught up to STRs in the third quarter. However, given lower 2025 volumes impacted by industry performance, we now anticipate year-end distributor inventory to be lower compared to year-end 2024 on an absolute basis. The year-end days of inventories remain relatively consistent and at what we view as healthy levels entering the new year. As a result, for the fourth quarter, we expect the U.S. STW trend to trail the U.S. STR trend excluding contract billing.\nAll of the top line drivers remain unchanged. We continue to expect U.S. industry volume to be down on average 4% to 6% for the second half of the year, while mindful the comparisons versus the year ago period was somewhat softer earlier in the third quarter before becoming more difficult into year-end. We will cycle 1.9 million hectoliters of contract brewing volume in the Americas in 2025 related to Pabst and Labatt and will so the remain 300,000 hectoliters in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect an annual net price increase of 1% to 2% in North America in line with the average historical range and mix benefits from cycling contracts growing from 2024 as well as from premiumization in both business units.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect costs to be negatively impacted by volume deleverage, including the lower expectations for year-end U.S. distributor inventory. Also, Middle East premium pricing has continued to increase. Our guidance assumed a price range of $0.60 to $0.75 per pound. This implies for the full year, Midwest premium costs will exceed the prior year by $40 million to $55 billion, with most of the increase occurring in the second half of the year. However, as you can see on Page 18 of our earnings slides, the price trended at the upper end of this range in the third quarter and was slightly above it in October. Therefore, we expect increases to be at the high end of that range.\nAs for MG&A, we continue to expect it to be down slightly for the year due to lower incentive compensation, which is largely offset by higher non-alc infrastructure costs as well as the Fever-Tree onetime transition and integration fees in the first half of the year. Again, those onetime fees were approximately $50 million and will be recovered through net sales over the next 2 years, which began in the second quarter of this year. In closing, we remain committed to improving shareholder value and look forward to sharing more about our strategic plans and long-term objectives in the coming months. With that, we will take your questions. Operator?"

We will focus our prepared remarks on what we believe is top of mind for you, and that is the industry, how we're responding, capital allocation and our financial outlook.\nAnd please note that given the current environment, we are providing a more detailed than typical review of our 2025 guidance drivers. We will then take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll pass it over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin Hattersley\n\nCEO of US Business, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Traci. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. During the second quarter, we continued to execute against our strategic plans to support our long-term growth objectives and to return cash to shareholders while navigating a challenging and volatile macro environment. As a result of the uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade and immigration policies, consumer sentiment in the U.S. has remained at relatively low historical levels.\nThis has continued to pressure consumption trends. These macro impacts in the U.S. have had a disproportionate effect on the lower income and Hispanic consumer. And within beer, these consumer segments have driven the reduction in the number of buyers as well as spend with a shift to singles in the second quarter.\nIn addition, while less impactful certain regions of the U.S. experienced some severe weather conditions during the quarter which had a notable impact on the important Memorial Day weekend. These factors have resulted in a much softer U.S. beer industry so far this year than we had previously expected. Recall our guidance issued on May 8 had assumed the U.S. industry would improve for the balance of the year from down approximately 5% in the first quarter to levels closer to that of the last several years, which averaged down around 3%.\nBut in the second quarter, the industry continued to be down around 5%. Further, the Midwest Premium pricing, which is a component of our aluminum cost has been indirectly impacted by recent U.S. tariff announcements, causing another substantial and unexpected spike in the second quarter. For perspective and as you can clearly see on Slide 19 of our earnings deck, in July, the Midwest Premium jumped to $0.68 per pound, an increase of over 180% since January.\nAs a result of these macro drivers and to a lesser degree, lower-than-expected share performance, we are reducing our top and bottom-line guidance for 2025. We now expect net sales revenue to decline 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis as compared to a low single-digit decline previously. The range assumes U.S. industry volume will decline between 4% and 6% for the second half of the year. We now expect underlying pretax income to decline 12% to 15% on a constant currency basis as compared to a low single-digit decline previously.\nThe range includes for the second half of the year, incremental costs specific to the Midwest Premium of $20 million to $35 million which assumes a respective price per pound of $0.60 to $0.75. This is partly offset by lower expected incentive compensation given the change in outlook. As a result, we now expect underlying earnings per share to decline 7% to 10% as compared to low single-digit growth.\nHowever, we are reaffirming our underlying free cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion, plus or minus 10%, as we expect higher cash tax benefits and favorable working capital to offset the guidance decline for underlying pretax income.\nNow Tracey will speak to our guidance in more detail in a moment. But first, I want to stress that we continue to view the incremental softness in the industry performance this year is cyclical, driven by the macroeconomic environment. And this belief in our view, is clearly demonstrated by the execution of our share repurchase program well ahead of our original expectations.\nWhile U.S. consumer basket sizes are smaller in the current environment, the percent of alcohol in those baskets has remained the same. And legal drinking age consumers continue to engage with beer at similar levels across all generations and compared to historical levels, it's the occasions that are left.\nRecognizing this, our strategy was built to develop a portfolio that appeals to a wide range of preferences and captures more occasions. So as we navigate these macro pressures, we are continuing to execute the strategy and prudently invest behind our business. To build on the strength of our core power brands, to premiumize our business in both beer and beyond beer and to develop and leverage our capabilities and partnerships to support profitable growth.\nIn the U.S., our core power brands, Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet have retained the unprecedented shelf space gains achieved in spring of 2024. Collectively, they commanded a 15.2% volume share of the industry for the first half of the year. Recall that 3 years ago, these brands collectively commanded 13.4% of the U.S. industry.\nAnd what's clear in the scanner data, and as shown on Slide 20, is that these brands have held most of their share gains from the last 2 years through the second quarter. Banquet in particular, has been a strong performer. After 16 consecutive quarters of share growth, it was a top 5 volume share growth brand in the quarter. And given it's only about half the buying outlets of Coors Light, we believe there is significant distribution runway ahead.\nIn fact, Banquet gained over 15% distribution in the first half of this year, growing across every channel and on top of over 15% growth in the same period last year. In Canada, despite a challenging industry backdrop, the Molson family of brands with its deep Canadian routes posted another quarter of volume share gains. While Coors Light, which is proudly locally produced held its #1 light beer position in the industry.\nIn EMEA and APAC, the industry in the U.K. has remained highly competitive, and in the Central and Eastern Europe region, it continues to experience softness related to escalating global, local political and economic tensions. But our brands like Carling in the U.K. and Ožujsko and Croatia remains segment leaders in their respective markets, which we intend to continue to support with targeted commercial plans.\nTurning to premiumization. As we have said for several quarters now, in the U.S., there has been a shift to value-seeking behaviors, but it has been focused on pack size rather than on brands. And despite the pressure on the consumer, the industry continues to premiumize, albeit currently at a slower post. So we remain committed to our premiumization plans, which are focused on both beer and beyond beer.\nOver the last few years, we have talked a lot about our premiumization successes outside the U.S. In EMEA and APAC, it's been fueled by a hugely successful innovation with Madri, which we believe still has significant runway, both in its initial market of the U.K. and through recent geographic and brand extensions. In fact, in the latest 12 weeks, as of June 14, Madri had overtaken Peroni to become the #2 brand in the world's large segment and #4 beer overall in terms of value across total trade in the U.K.\nIn Canada, premiumization has been led by the ongoing strength of Miller Lite and our flavor portfolio. But in the U.S., our largest market, we under-index in above premium, which makes it a big opportunity. Our Peroni plans that began in the second quarter are starting to show positive results with the brand growing volume double digits in the last 13 weeks through July 27, supported by continued growth in chain and on-premise placements.\nAnd while smaller for now, we are encouraged by our innovations. Blue Moon non-alc continues its rapid growth, and we are seeing growing placements for our new higher ABV brands, Blue Moon Extra, Simply Bold and Topo Chico MAX Margarita. These higher ABV brands not only support our push to expand in C-stores but are particularly timely given current value-seeking behaviors.\nAnd while these innovations are helpful to their respective brand families, we recognize the challenges of their big flagship brands and are focused on stabilizing it. For example, with Blue Moon, we have completed the pack size conversion to 12 from 15 packs. This was a near-term volume headwind, but it's very positive for margin.\nIn the on-premise, which is a big channel for Blue Moon, we saw dollar share trend improvement during the second quarter. And in the third quarter, we have been ramping up a new national advertising campaign with comedian Colin Jost. And then there is non-alc. Fever-Tree is now our highest NSR per hectoliter brand aside from full-strength spirits.\nWhile we began to consolidate Fever-Tree into our financials in February, we only completed the distribution network transition in June. And the incoming distributors are very excited about the opportunity to significantly expand Fever-Tree's presence across both existing and new channels and buying outlets. It's early days, but the brand has already contributed meaningfully as the key driver of positive brand mix in the Americas.\nAnd while Fever-Tree is already the world's leading supplier of premium carbonated mixes with the #1 tonic and the #1 ginger beer by value in the U.S., we believe we can accelerate its growth in the U.S. over time by leveraging the scale and strength of our distribution network, combined with our marketing capabilities.\nNow before I pass it to Tracey, I'll sum it up to say, it's been a difficult start to the year, but we viewed beer as resilient. And amid a challenging macro backdrop, we are focusing on what we can control to position our portfolio and our business for long-term success.\nThat means keeping our core power brands healthy, continuing to premiumize in EMEA and APAC and Canada and successfully executing our plans in the U.S. Leveraging our deep capabilities across our organization to support premiumization and focused innovation, supply chain efficiencies and commercial effectiveness. And utilizing our enhanced financial flexibility to prudently invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will pass it to Tracey.\n\nTracey Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin. We are very pleased with the health of our balance sheet and our strong cash generation. And this is particularly important during a challenging macro environment as it allows us to continue to invest behind our brands to help ensure their long-term health, to continue to make capital investments that support our growth initiatives and cost savings plans and to not only pay what we view as a competitive dividend, but also execute a meaningful share repurchase program as we continue to believe our stock is a compelling investment.\nIn fact, we have raised the quarterly dividend each year since 2021, and we have actively executed our current share repurchase plan since it was announced in October 2023. We have repurchased 9.4% of our Class B shares outstanding. It's an up to 5-year $2 billion plan, and we have utilized almost 55% in under 2 years. For perspective, if we had executed it on a straight-line basis, we would have only utilized 35% of the plan so far.\nWith that, let's discuss our financial outlook. First, the impact of the global macro environment are multifaceted and difficult to predict. And while we have included in our guidance, our best estimate of some of these factors, external drivers may significantly impact our actual results either up or down.\nAs it relates to tariffs, as we have previously said, while we are a global business, our products are generally made in the markets in which they are sold and with locally sourced ingredients. So we don't expect material direct impact from the known tariffs on our input costs. That said, tariffs do have indirect impact, but the recent spike in the Midwest Premium pricing. While our extensive hedging program can help to mitigate some of the impact due to the guardrails of our program, we are never fully hedged.\nFurther, given its opaque pricing and at times limited liquidity, hedging the Midwest Premium can be difficult and expensive. And for these reasons, the Midwest Premium is one of the commodities for which we currently have the least amount of hedge coverage.\nWith that, let's discuss the drivers of the guidance Gavin outlined. Our top line guidance range now assumes the U.S. industry is down 4% to 6% for the second half of the year. Our price mix assumptions are unchanged. We expect an annual net price increase of 1% to 2% in North America, in line with the average historical range. We expect mix benefits from cycling contracts growing from 2024 as well as from premiumization.\nWe expect to grow above premium net brand revenue in EMEA and APAC and Canada as well as make progress on our U.S. above premium initiatives. Fever-Tree and the consolidation of ZOA are incremental to the top line, but we are also starting the divestiture of the smaller regional craft breweries in the third quarter of 2024. And more significantly, 2024 Pabst and Labatt contract brewing volume as these contracts terminated at the end of last year.\nWe expect the related Americas contract brewing headwind to be 1.9 million hectoliters in 2025. In the first half, we cycled over 1.1 million hectoliters, and we will cycle over 450,000 hectoliters in the third quarter. Also, last year, we had higher than typical first half inventory build related to the Fort Worth strike, which ended in mid-May. As a result, STWs outpaced STR by 1.1 million hectoliters in the first half of last year.\nThis year, STWs outpaced STR by 800,000 hectoliters in the first half. So year-on-year, we had an approximate 300,000 hectoliter shipment timing headwind in the first half that we expect to reverse in the second half and mainly in the third quarter. Note that we did have some shipment trend catch-up to STRs in the second quarter, which had an approximate 150 basis point positive impact on U.S. financial volume in the quarter. We had previously not expected to build higher than last year given the cycling of the Fort Worth strike. [Technical Difficulty] we were able to ship further ahead of STRs than expected due to the softer-than-anticipated industry demand.\nFor a detailed review of these U.S. shipment trends, please refer to Slide 21. Moving down the P&L. We expect mix benefits from lower contract brewing and increased premiumization as well as productivity improvements and cost savings to now be more than offset by higher volume deleverage given the industry volume trends as well as higher Midwest Premium costs. For the full year, this would result in Midwest Premium costs exceeding the prior year by $40 million to $55 million. We now expect MG&A to be down slightly for the year as we now anticipate lower incentive compensation due to the adjusted outlook for this year.\nAlso, and to a lesser degree, the Fever-Tree onetime transition and integration fees were less than expected, totaling approximately $50 million in the first half of the year. Again, these fees will be recovered through net sales over the next 3 years beginning in June.\nAs for marketing, our plans are unchanged. We intend to continue to put the right commercial pressure behind our key brands and innovations, including our core power brands, Peroni, the Blue Moon family, Madri and our non-alc portfolio. While marketing investment was down in the second quarter, cycling up spend in the prior year period, we expect it to be up in the third quarter due to the timing of our commercial plans and lower spend in the same period last year.\nAs a result, we expect marketing investment in the peak summer months to be consistent with prior year period levels. We are also slightly adjusting our net interest expense outlook. We now expect $225 million, plus or minus 5% as compared to $215 million, plus or minus 5% previously. This is driven by lower cash balances, including the impact of higher share repurchases as well as foreign currency impact. And lastly, we are reaffirming our underlying free cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion, plus or minus 10%.\nIn closing, with a strong global brand portfolio, healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation, we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenging times while supporting the long-term health of our business and brands. We are committed to protecting and growing our underlying free cash flow while making prudent capital allocation decisions that support our growth initiatives and allow us to return even more cash to shareholders.\nWith that, we will take your questions.

Following prepared remarks today, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Also I encourage you to review our earnings release and earnings slides, which are posted on the IR section of our website and provide detailed financial and operational metrics.\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to our risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. The definitions of reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our earnings release.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all financial results we discuss are versus the comparable prior year period and are in U.S. dollars. With the exception of earnings per share, all financial metrics are in constant currency when referencing percentage changes from the prior year period. Also share data references are sourced from Circana in the U.S. and from Beer Canada and Canada unless otherwise indicated.\nFurther, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income, which equates to underlying income before income taxes and underlying earnings per share, which equates to underlying diluted earnings per share as defined in our earnings release.\nNow with that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin Hattersley\n\nCEO of US Business, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Traci. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. Like for so many of our peers in staples, it certainly was a challenging first quarter. The global macroeconomic environment is volatile due to uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence and expectations around inflation and currencies. These shifts have pressured consumption trends as the consumer faces a high level of uncertainty, and the beer industry has not been immune to these macro changes.\nFortunately, while we are a global business, our beers and beverages are generally made in the markets in which they are sold, meaning the vast majority of our brands sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S. with U.S. ingredients. The same is true of our Canadian business. So from that perspective, we believe that we are one of the better positioned businesses in our category. Adding to the dynamics in the quarter, we had several expected shipment headwinds as well as onetime transition and integration fees related to Fever-Tree.\nAnd given that this all occurred in our typically lowest revenue quarter of the year, there was a more pronounced impact on our quarterly results. Now we recognize that these macro-driven uncertainties persist and it's unclear for how long. As we discuss the details around the performance in the quarter, I want to emphasize that there have been no changes in our belief in the continued strengthening of our core brands and in our long-term growth algorithm.\nThe continued premiumization of our portfolio, ability to maintain unprecedented U.S. shelf space gains and our recent investment in Fever-Tree give us increased confidence in our long-term growth journey. But we do recognize the macro environment is impacting our performance in the near term. So we are focusing on controlling what we can control. We are taking actions to best ensure that we can navigate and mitigate the short-term challenges while continuing to support the medium- and long-term health and growth objectives of the company.\nThis means executing our strategy to further strengthen our core power brands and premiumize our business. And we have strong commercial plans globally as we head into the peak season, which is still ahead of us. It means taking a deeper look at near-term nonbusiness-critical discretionary cost-saving opportunities to help protect profitability. And it means adjusting our 2025 capital expenditure plans to best ensure we are utilizing our strong annual free cash flow in the most prudent ways given the current environment. This entails refining capital investments to focus on our highest priority growth and productivity initiatives while continuing to return cash to shareholders.\nNow while these mitigation efforts are helpful, the magnitude of the impacts of the macroeconomic environment in the industry has been much greater so far this year than we had expected. For example, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell by nearly 20 percentage points since the beginning of the year and GDP turned negative for the first quarter.\nAmid these pressures on the macro and consumer environment, we are updating our guidance for the full year, and we now expect a low single-digit net sales revenue decline on a constant currency basis as compared to low single-digit growth previously, a low single-digit underlying pretax income decline on a constant currency basis as compared to mid-single-digit growth previously and a low single-digit underlying earnings per share growth as compared to high single-digit growth previously. However, we are reaffirming our underlying free cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion, plus or minus 10%.\nNow Tracey will touch more on the guidance drivers shortly. But now let's take a moment to discuss the quarter. Consolidated net sales revenue was down 10.4%, underlying pretax income was down 49.5% and underlying earnings per share was down 47.4%. The top line performance was meaningfully impacted by volume performance, particularly in the U.S. U.S. financial volume was down 15.7%. And this lagged U.S. brand volume, which was down 8.8%.\nAs I mentioned, the unexpected macroeconomic pressures on consumer consumption behavior were a big driver of our results. However, there were several expected headwinds in the quarter that contributed to the volume performance. We were cycling significantly higher demand in the first quarter of last year when STRs were up 5.8%. There was also 1 less trading day in the first quarter this year, which adversely impacted the U.S. brand volume trend by 140 basis points.\nThere were also shipment timing dynamics. In the first quarter of 2024, we deliberately built inventory as we prepared for the possible strike at our Fort Worth brewery, which, as you know, became a reality. And as a result, STWs outpaced STRs by over 750,000 hectoliters. In the first quarter of this year, STWs outpaced STRs by only 200,000 hectoliters. This had a nearly 500 basis point negative impact on U.S. financial volume in the quarter.\nFurther, as we expected, we cycled a combined approximate 590,000 hectoliters of contract brewing volume for Pabst in the U.S. and Labatt in Canada in the first quarter of 2024. This contract brewing volume, which related to agreements that terminated at the end of 2024, had a negative 4 percentage point impact on Americas financial volume for the quarter.\nAgain, while the exit of this contract brewing is a temporary volume headwind, we expect to have a positive impact in 2025 and beyond on mix, margin and brewery network effectiveness. In fact, net sales revenue per hectoliter in the Americas was up 4.8%.\nIn addition to favorable net pricing growth, it was driven by mix benefits, which largely resulted from the exit of this contract brewing volume. It also benefited from positive brand mix led by the addition of Fever-Tree in the U.S., which is already showing early positive signs in our investment thesis and its long-term impact on our business.\nIn EMEA and APAC, our financial volume was down 9.7% due to soft industry demand across our regions and the heightened competitive landscape. However, this was partly offset by net sales revenue per hectoliter growth of 5.4%, driven by favorable sales mix, including higher factored brand volume and continued premiumization and increased pricing.\nFrom a consolidated earnings perspective, we continue to closely manage costs while maintaining strong commercial support for our brands globally. However, lower volumes, volume deleverage, higher input costs and onetime Fever-Tree transition and integration fees of approximately $30 million negatively impacted bottom line results.\nOur underlying free cash flow was negative $265 million. The first quarter is typically a cash use quarter and our smallest quarter of the year in terms of revenue and profit. So we invested $88 million for an 8.5% equity stake in Fevertree Drinks plc and returned nearly $160 million to shareholders through a higher quarterly dividend as well as ongoing share repurchases.\nDespite a volatile quarter, we continue to view our valuation is compelling given our belief in our business and in our long-term growth algorithm. In fact, for the first 6 quarters since the share repurchase program was announced, we had already executed over 40% of this up to 5-year program, which if you straight line the number would have us at only 30%. And this belief comes from our commitment to our strategy and our ability to execute it. Through continued brand support and investments in our capabilities and partnerships, we are making progress in advancing our strategic priorities.\nI'll start with our core power brands. In the U.S., Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet have combined 15.4 volume share as compared to 13.5 in the first quarter of 2023. Said differently, these brands combined were up 1.9 share points since the first quarter of 2023, continuing to demonstrate that the step change improvement in volume share performance is sticky.\nPlease refer to Slide 18 in our earnings deck, which highlights our strong and sustained share performance. And very importantly, we have retained a collective unprecedented U.S. shelf space games for our core portfolio which we achieved last spring. All of this reflects the ongoing strength and resilience of these brands.\nCoors Banquet momentum continued to accelerate with brand volume up double digits and growing industry share for the 15th consecutive quarter. And this is no small brand. Banquet is our third largest revenue brand in the U.S. In fact, it remains the fastest-growing top 15 brand in the U.S. on a volume percentage growth basis. And retailers certainly recognize this as evidenced by the 20% distribution gains in the quarter with growing distribution across every channel.\nAnd we expect the brand's strong momentum to continue based on the distribution gains that we are seeing with spring resets. And still, Banquet has only half of the outlets buying compared to Coors Light and its awareness is significantly below those of other big beer brands. So we are investing to unlock the big opportunity that lies ahead and we see no reason Banquet can't ultimately become a top 10 U.S. brand.\nIn Canada, Coors Light remains the #1 light beer in the industry, while the Molson family of brands gained volume share again this quarter, with gains accelerating in the quarter for this brand with deep Canadian roots. This performance has helped us to drive 8 consecutive quarters of share growth despite the challenging industry backdrop.\nIn EMEA and APAC, a number of our core power brands are leaders in their respective markets. Carling remains a top lager in the U.K. with strong brand equity among its core drinkers in the highly competitive U.K. beer market, and we have continued to take a value-over-volume approach, which is weighed on volume performance.\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Ožujsko in Croatia maintained its position as the segment leader and continued to increase value segment share on a rolling 12-month basis, while Caraiman in Romania, which launched last year and has had strong trials, continue to gain value share of segment in the quarter. This has been despite industry softness in the region related to escalating global political and economic tensions.\nTurning to our premiumization priority for both beer and beyond beer. In the Americas, Canada continued to premiumize driven by the ongoing success of Miller Lite, which is the fastest-growing major beer brand in this market on a percentage basis as well as by our flavor portfolio. We are 1 of only 2 major brewers growing share of flavor in Canada. In the U.S., many of our premiumization plans for this year are just getting started as we head into peak season.\nIn beer, the Blue Moon brand family held share of industry through February, continuing the share stabilization trends we saw in the second half of last year. In March, Blue Moon Belgium White was temporarily negatively impacted as we converted from 15 packs to 12 packs to align with broader consumer preferences and given the benefits related to margins, supply chain efficiency and packaging consistency. And the positive momentum behind our newer innovation Blue Moon non-alc has continued gaining over a point of dollar share in the non-alc beer segment in the quarter.\nTurning now to Peroni. The plans we've been talking about for a while now are just starting to kick off. As a reminder, with onshore production, we have unlocked meaningful cost savings, which we intend to deploy towards increased distribution and awareness to drive scale and margin for this brand.\nThrough our strong commercial programs, along with improved continuity of supply and new pack sizes, we are securing more on-premise placements and expanding our presence at retail with placements up nearly 50% in chain. And while it's early days, ultimately, we expect Peroni can rival the size of other major European imports in the U.S. over time.\nIn beyond beer, which is an important part of our premiumization plans, non-alc is a key focus area. It's part of our strategic ambition to build a total beverage portfolio for a wide range of consumer preferences across both traditional alcohol and non-alc occasions. It provides us with the opportunity to capture more occasions, particularly among younger legal drinking age Gen Z consumers. And we are investing behind the growing areas in non-alc, where we believe we have a right to win. Our approach in non-alc is multipronged. Within beyond beer, it includes pure players like ZOA, alcohol adjacent products like Fever-Tree and alcohol replacements like Naked Life.\nLast October, we increased our equity stake in ZOA to a majority position. By leading the entirety of the brand's marketing, retail and direct-to-consumer sales development and leveraging the strength of our network, we believe we can drive brand awareness and distribution. In fact, we have a significant number of new chain retailers coming on board with expanded distribution in several key accounts this spring.\nAnd we are continuing to build on our partnership with Dwayne Johnson with a new campaign that delivers an impactful functional message, supported by a bigger media push and the early consumer sentiment reads on the campaign are promising.\nAnd then there is Fever-Tree, the world's leading supplier of premium carbonated mixes with the #1 tonic and the #1 ginger beer in the U.S. since 2021. Through this strategic partnership, we have the exclusive commercialization rights to the Fever-Tree brand in the U.S., its largest market. Fever-Tree U.S. volume was approximately 500,000 hectoliters in 2024. So you can see it adds real scale to our non-operations. This partnership has had an immediate impact as every single case we sell at Fever-Tree is incremental to our business.\nAnd when you consider that Molson Coors has about 500,000 outlets buying as compared to Fever-Tree, which has the tens of thousands, we believe in the upside potential is substantial. And having just completed our distributor RFP process, we are pleased to share that Fever-Tree's direct sales to distributors will shift to the Molson Coors and affiliated non-alc beverage distributors. The excitement and responses to the RFP from the distributors demonstrate their commitment to taking Fever-Tree to the next level. So we intend to leverage the scale and strength of our distribution network, combined with our marketing capabilities to accelerate Fever-Tree's growth over time.\nTurning to EMEA and APAC, Madri's net brand revenue was up high single digits in the quarter, continuing to support premiumization in a business for which net brand revenue is already more than half above premium. This 4-year-old innovation is already a top 10 brand for us globally, and we see significant runway ahead.\nIn addition to its strong performance in its initial market of the U.K. and a very successful launch in Bulgaria last year, we just added Madri to our portfolio in Romania in March. Our deliberate expansion of this brand is not just geographic. In March, we launched Madri 0.0 in the U.K. to capitalize on the rapidly growing non-alc beer segment in the market.\nNow before I pass it to Tracey, I'll conclude by saying that these are dynamic and uncertain times. But we are taking steps to protect our profitability and free cash flow while continuing to execute our strategic initiatives, which supports our long-term growth objectives. We remain committed to supporting the health of our core power brands globally. We have strong plans to premiumize our global portfolio, building on successes in EMEA and APAC and Canada and executing targeted programs in the U.S.\nWe expect to build on and leverage our capabilities across our organization that support premiumization and focused innovation, supply chain efficiencies and commercial effectiveness. And we intend to utilize our greatly enhanced financial flexibility to prudently invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.\nOur company, through its various iterations, has navigated volatile times for more than a century. And by being proactive and adaptive, we have often emerged even stronger. We remain focused on what we can control, taking actions to help mitigate near-term challenges while continuing to invest in our business and brands in order to achieve our growth algorithm over the long term.\nAnd with that, I will pass it to Tracey.\n\nTracey Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin. Our work over the last several years has greatly improved the efficiency of our business from supply chain to commercial operations. These efforts have helped to drive an increase in margins over the last 2 years and support the further expansion opportunity that underpins our long-term growth algorithm.\nThere are multiple drivers that impact our margins. They include pricing, mix, input costs, volume leverage and cost savings and the impact of those drivers vary by quarter. In the first quarter, underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 6.1%. This was mainly due to volume deleverage given the U.S. shipment trends Gavin discussed.\nIn the first quarter, volume deleverage negatively impacted underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter by 420 basis points. While in the prior year period, volume leverage was 110 basis points benefit. Mix also contributed, driving 220 basis points of the increase in underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter. This was due to lower contract brewing volume in North America and premiumization in each business unit. But importantly, while these mix impacts increased cost of goods sold per hectoliter, they are favorable to margin.\nAs for inflation, while we did experience moderated increases in input costs, this was largely offset by our ongoing cost savings and extensive hedging program.\nMG&A was up modestly in the quarter as increases in G&A, which included onetime transition and integration fees of approximately $30 million related to the Fever-Tree partnership, was partly offset by slightly lower marketing.\nTurning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, net debt to underlying EBITDA was 2.47x. This was an increase from year-end 2024 as we normally see a sequential uptick in the first quarter given lower cash balances. This ratio is in alignment with our long-term target of under 2.5x and underscores the health of our balance sheet. This, along with the highly cash-generative nature of our business, provides us more optionality in the ways that we invest in the business, be it through capital investments that drive productivity improvement or through bolt-on M&A that support our strategic growth objectives.\nOur recent investments in high-growth non-alc brands like Fever-Tree are great examples. It also provides us with the opportunity to return even more cash to shareholders. We paid $99 million in cash dividend and $60 million to repurchase 1 million shares in the quarter. Since the plan was announced in October 2023, we have repurchased 7.2% of our Class B shares outstanding. It's an up to 5-year $2 billion plan. And as Gavin mentioned, we have utilized over 40% in just the first 6 quarters.\nAnd as we previously announced, in the first quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.47. This was an increase of 6.8% and represented our fourth consecutive year of increases, clearly demonstrating our intention to sustainably increase our dividends. And given our share repurchases, we were able to raise the dividend without incurring aggregate higher dividend cash payments.\nAnd now I'll conclude with our financial outlook. First, there's a great deal of volatility in the global macro environment, resulting in uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impact from economic growth, consumer trends and currency. These impacts are multifaceted and difficult to predict. And while we have included in our guidance, our best estimate of some of these factors, external drivers may significantly impact our actual results either up or down.\nFortunately, as Gavin mentioned earlier, while we are a global business, our beers and beverages are generally made in the markets in which they are sold. Meaning the vast majority of our brands sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S. with U.S. ingredients, and that is the same for our Canadian business.\nWe have a limited number of brands that we import into the U.S. and their volumes are relatively small. For example, we import Molson Canadian from Canada and Sol from Mexico, again, both very small brands in the U.S. Also, since a significant portion of our direct materials are sourced domestically or are U.S. MCA compliance, we don't expect a material direct impact from the known tariffs on our input costs. Therefore, we believe we are one of the better positioned businesses in our category.\nSo we continue to evaluate options to mitigate exposure and risk. For example, leveraging additional domestic supply where possible. And while tariffs have had indirect impact, causing fluctuations in commodity costs plus the Midwest Premium, our extensive hedging program can help to mitigate some of that exposure.\nLastly, please remember that net sales revenue and underlying pretax income growth guidance metrics are on a constant currency basis and underlying earnings per share is not. Therefore, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar will impact our reported results as well as underlying earnings per share growth and in the effective period using the current exchange rate.\nWith that said, as Gavin discussed, we have updated several of our guidance metrics due to softer industry trends than we believe most expected, which we attribute to the macro shift that we have discussed that have driven consumer uncertainty and pressured consumption trends. As such, we have updated certain key guidance metrics.\nWe now expect a low single-digit net sales revenue decline on a constant currency basis as compared to low single-digit growth previously, a low single-digit underlying pretax income decline on a constant currency basis as compared to mid-single-digit growth previously, a low single-digit underlying earnings per share growth as compared to high single-digit growth previously, lower capital expenditures incurred of $650 million plus or minus 5% as compared to $750 million plus or minus 5% previously. All remaining metrics are unchanged, including underlying free cash flow of $1.3 billion, plus or minus 10%.\nTurning to our guidance drivers. Our top line assumes an anticipated annual net price increase of 1% to 2% in North America, in line with the average historical range and for other markets to trend in line with inflation. It also assumes mix benefits from cycling contract brewing from 2024 as well as from premiumization.\nIn 2025, we expect to continue to grow above-premium net brand revenue in EMEA and APAC and Canada as well as make progress in the U.S., where, as Gavin shared, we remain committed to turning Blue Moon around and are embarking on big plans for Peroni and non-alc.\nWhile Fever-Tree and the consolidation of ZOA provide incremental benefits to the top line, we will also be cycling revenue from the smaller regional craft breweries we divested in the third quarter of 2024, and more significantly, 2024 Pabst and Labatt contract brewing volume as again, these contracts terminated at the end of last year.\nOn a combined basis, we expect related 1.9 million hectoliter headwind to Americas financial volume in 2025. In the first quarter, we cycled about 590,000 hectoliters of this contract brewing volume on a combined basis. We will cycle a similar amount in the second quarter.\nAlso recall that last year, we had higher than typical inventory build in the U.S. related to the Fort Worth strike, which ended in mid-May. As a result, STWs outpaced STRs by approximately 1.1 million hectoliters in the first half with STWs exceeding STR by about 350,000 hectoliters in the second quarter of 2024. So given that hurdle in the second quarter, we anticipate that this year's shipment trend catch-up to STRs will occur primarily in the third quarter.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect fixed benefits from lower contract brewing and increased premiumization, moderating inflation on input costs and productivity improvements and cost savings to be offset by higher than previously expected volume deleverage given industry volume trends.\nWe continue to expect MG&A to be up for the year. This is largely driven by higher G&A related to our non-alc initiative, which include infrastructure investments to support our total non-alc business as well as Fever-Tree onetime transition and integration fees.\nDue to the timing of the RFP process, in addition to the approximately $13 million recorded in the first quarter, we expect to record a remaining amount of under $10 million in the second quarter. However, we expect to recover these fees in the form of a credit to net sales revenue over the next 3 years. These G&A increases are expected to be partly offset by deliberate actions to manage our near-term cost structure given the current macro environment.\nFor example, we are taking a deliberate and more restrictive approach to our recruitment efforts in the near term, and we intend to reduce certain nonbusiness-critical discretionary items like travel and entertainment. As for marketing, we intend to put the right commercial pressure behind our brands with strong investments behind our core power brands: Peroni, the Blue Moon family, Madrid and our non-alc portfolio.\nWe are also refining and prioritizing our capital projects for 2025. As a result, we are reducing our guidance for capital expenditures by $100 million, postponing certain projects that do not relate to significant cost savings or critical growth initiatives. We are committed to protecting and growing our underlying free cash flow while making prudent capital allocation decisions that support our growth initiatives and allow us to return cash to shareholders.\nTo sum it up, these are uncertain times, but we believe we have the right strategy and a healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation to continue to execute it while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We believe we are taking the necessary steps to help protect profitability in the near term while supporting the health of our business and brands in the medium and long term.\nNow before we open it up to your questions, Gavin has a few closing remarks. Gavin?\n\nGavin Hattersley\n\nCEO of US Business, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThanks, Tracey. A few weeks ago, the company announced my intention to retire at the end of this year. After nearly 45 years in the workforce and 28 years in this incredible industry, I thought it was time. I am so proud to have been a part of Molson Coors many accomplishments over the decades and honored to have led this great company for the last 6 years.\nNow while the Board executes our succession process, I want you to know that it is business as usual at Molson Coors. We remain hard at work, executing our strategy and focused on achieving our revised financial objectives this year. As I prepared to step aside, I remain confident in the beer industry, in the company's position, its business plans and its future. So I look forward to continuing to engage with you all, the investment community in the months ahead as we set up the next leader to build on the company's success.\nAnd with that, we will take your questions.

With that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin Hattersley\n\nCEO of US Business, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Greg. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. 2024 was another year of progress for Molson Coors, progress in advancing our strategy and achieving bottom line growth. And with a challenging macroeconomic environment, we continue to support the health of our brands globally. We retained a substantial portion of our sizable share gains from 2023 and earned unprecedented levels of shelf space for our core power brands in the U.S.\nWe achieved incredible growth in Canada, broadly across all price segments of our portfolio. We continue to premiumize off a high base in our EMEA and APAC business. We terminated low-margin contract brewing agreement and exited smaller unprofitable businesses while investing in areas that we expect will drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. 2024 was also another year of continued strong cash generation that contributed to earnings power.\nWe delivered more than $1.2 billion in underlying free cash flow which, combined with our healthy balance sheet, enabled us to not only invest in our business, but also to return $1 billion in cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We enter this year confident Issuing 2025 guidance that both reflects the favorable fundamentals of our business, and it aligns with our long-term growth algorithm.\nNow with that high-level summary, let's get into some of the details. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales revenue was down 1.9%. Underlying pretax income was down 0.9% and underlying earnings per share was up 9.2%. In our Americas business, Canada continued to perform strongly, while as expected, the U.S. faced a temporary headwind related to the exit of PEPS contract out, which was a headwind of about 450,000 hectoliters.\nU.S. brand volume was down 3% in the quarter, which improved as compared to the third quarter as did the industry with a moderating of the more pronounced value-seeking behavior seen during the summer. These drivers contributed to a 6.7% decline in U.S. financial volume. Related to the deliberate inventory build in the first half of the year, U.S. shipments trailed brand volumes by approximately 150,000 hectoliters in the quarter, resulting in largely shipping to consumption for the full year as intended.\nIn EMEA and APAC, our volumes were impacted by the continued heightened competitive landscape in the U.K. as well as a softer industry in Central and Eastern Europe. However, this was largely offset by strong net sales revenue barely to growth of 7.8%, driven by favorable sales mix, including continued premiumization and pricing. This along with favorable net pricing growth in the Americas and mixed benefits from the exit of PEPS resulted in consolidated net sales revenue per hectoliter growth of 4.8% for the quarter.\nFor the year, consolidated net sales revenue was down 0.6%. Underlying pretax income was up 5.6% and underlying earnings per share was up 9.8%. Results were better than our revised top line guidance of down approximately 1% due to better-than-expected U.S. industry performance in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our 2024 top line guidance was revised lower when we reported our third quarter results in early November due to macro-driven U.S. industry softness in the peak season months of July and August.\nIt's also important to point out that excluding the impact of the wind down of PEPs contract brewing volume, our implied annual top line revenue growth was positive and in alignment with our long-term growth algorithm. In our volume perspective, PEPs had a negative 3 percentage point impact on Americas financial volume for the year. Again, while this is a current volume headwind, the reduction of this contract growing volume is expected to have a positive impact in 2025 and beyond on our brewery net effectiveness as well as on mix and margin.\nAnd in what we expect will provide further benefits, we no longer contract brew for Labatt USA and Canada with that volume fully exiting our Canadian business as of year-end 2024. Tracey will share more on the impact of that. Consolidated underlying pretax income was above the midpoint of our reaffirmed mid-single-digit growth guidance. This was achieved due to the better-than-expected top line as well as measured cost controls without sacrificing the right levels of brand marketing support.\nIn addition to added net sales revenue performance, we significantly exceeded our reaffirmed mid-single-digit underlying earnings per share growth guidance, which we had narrowed to the high end of the range in early November. The beat was largely supported by a lower-than-expected underlying effective tax rate due to U.S. geographic sales mix as well as the better-than-expected top line performance in the fourth quarter.\nOur underlying earnings per share growth was also supported by our share repurchases, which have been tracking at an accelerated pace as we continue to view our valuation is compelling given our confidence in our business and in our long-term growth algorithm. In fact, for the first 5 quarters since the share repurchase program was announced, we had already executed approximately 40% under this up to 5-year program, which if you straight line that number would have us at only 25%.\nOur confidence stems from our progress against our strategic priorities. I'll start with our core power brands. Collectively, they remain healthy. In the U.S., Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet have continued to retain a substantial portion of our share gains, demonstrating the stickiness of these step change gains. In the fourth quarter, they retained over 80% of their combined volume share gains on a 2-year stack, which is an improvement from both the second and third quarters.\nWhen compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, these brands were up 1.7 share points. Coors banquet continued to perform very well, brand volume up 16% and growing industry share for the 14th consecutive quarter on top of significant prior year gains. Banquet was the fastest-growing top 15 beer brand in the U.S. in terms of volume percentage growth in 2024. And it's not a small brand. In fact, it's one of our top 5 brands globally.\nWe see much more opportunity ahead as we invest in building the brand's awareness, its national scale and loyal consumer base, particularly among new Gen Z and millennial legal drinking age consumers. In Canada, Coors Light remains the #1 light beer in the industry and again, grew share of segment in the fourth quarter. The Molson family of brands also gained volume share for both the fourth quarter and the year.\nThis performance has helped us to drive 23 consecutive months of share growth despite the challenging industry backdrop. In EMEA and APAC, a number of our core power brands are leaders in their respective markets. Carling remains a top later in the U.K. with strong brand equity. And with the highly competitive environment, we took a value over volume approach, which weighed on volume performance during the year. And while core brand performance was impacted by the soft industry in the fourth quarter in Central and Eastern Europe, our results were strong for the year.\nThis was driven by Ozujsko in Croatia, which increased as well as the extremely successful relaunch of Caraiman in Romania. Caraiman has already reached over 300,000 hectoliters since March and has been incremental to the overall portfolio in the country. Turning to our premiumization priority for both beer and beyond beer. Our above premium portfolio was 27% of total net brand revenue for the year.\nIn EMEA and APAC, where over half of our net brand revenue comes below premium. Our business continued to premiumize. Much of EMEA and APAC's premiumization success has been driven by Madri, which grew net sales revenue double digits in the year and is the #2 lager in the on-premise in the U.K. in terms of value.\nMadri is also exceeding expectations in Bulgaria following a very successful launch there last year, in the Americas, our Above Premium share of net brand revenue was 22% for the year. This was supported by Canada, which also continued to premise with its above premium net brand revenue up at double digits in 2024. The -- this was driven by the success of Miller Lite, which is the fastest-growing major beer brand in this market on a percentage basis as well as by our flavor portfolio. We are growing more share of flavor than any other major brewer in Canada and Madri is also performing ahead of expectations in Canada following last year's launch.\nIn the U.S., there is work to do, but we see this as an opportunity, and we have big plans in 2025. After further fine-tuning our portfolio last year, including divesting underperforming craft breweries, our resources are focused on scalable opportunities within our expanding above premium portfolio brands in both beer and beyond beer.\nIn beer, we are moving in the right direction with the Blue Moon brand family as we are starting to see signs of stability. In fact, the Blue Moon brand family held share of industry in both the third and fourth quarters and took share of craft during both periods. This includes positive momentum behind some of our newer innovations like the repositioned Blue Moon Light as well as Blue Moon non-alc, which has quickly become a top 10 non-alc brand. And we have plans to build on these results for the Blue min brand family in 2025. And we are betting big on Peroni. As we have discussed, we have onshore production, which offers a number of benefits. It significantly improves consistency and certainty of supply, which has previously been a challenge when we tried to scale the brand.\nIt allows us to introduce different pack sizes, which consumers are asking for and it also unlocks meaningful cost savings, which we intend to deploy toward increasing distribution and awareness to drive scale and margin for this brand. Our commercial plans kick off in the second quarter and while it will, of course, take time, ultimately, we see no reason why Peroni really can't rival the size of other major European imports in the U.S. over time.\nIn Beyond Beer, which is a big part of our premiumization plans, non-alc is a key focus area. It provides us the opportunity to capture more occasions, particularly among younger legal age Gen Z consumers. So we are investing behind the growing areas in non-alc where we believe we have a right to win. This too will take some time, but we are making progress. We spoke in detail on our last quarter call about our increased investment in ZOA to a majority stake and plans to accelerate the brand are well underway.\nIt's early days of the integration. But in the last 4 weeks to end the year, ZOA grew in both dollar and unit share in total U.S. Food. Taking this increased stake allows us to lead the entirety of the brand's marketing, retail and direct-to-consumer sales development as we drive brand awareness and distribution, leveraging the strength of our network. And speaking of opportunities to advance our non-op plans, we are so pleased to have entered into a strategic partnership agreement with the world's leading supplier of premium carbonated mixes.\nThe partnership agreement gives us the exclusive commercialization rights to the Fever tree brand in the U.S. This is a significant step forward in our strategic ambition to build a total beverage portfolio for a wide range of consumer preferences across both traditional alcohol and non-alc occasions. Now before I pass it to Tracey, I'll conclude by saying that we remain confident we have the right strategy to achieve our long-term growth objectives.\nAnd our 2025 guidance is aligned with those objectives. Collectively, our global core power brands are healthy, and we have great commercial plans in 2025 to continue to support it. We are changing the shape of our global portfolio with premiumization successes in EMEA at APAC and Canada, and we have targeted plans for the U.S. Our operations outside of the U.S. are performing well and contributing meaningfully to our growth.\nOur capabilities across our organization support premiumization and focused innovation, supply chain efficiencies and commercial effectiveness, which helped drive sustained long-term profitable growth. And with our compelling cash generation and a healthy balance sheet, we have substantially improved our financial flexibility, allowing us to continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.\nSo we are pleased with our progress and confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term growth algorithm in 2025 and beyond. With that, I will pass it to Tracey.\n\nTracey Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin. We made strong progress in enhancing our profitability and financial flexibility in 2024. We delivered over $1.2 billion in underlying free cash flow, in line with our expectations. It was supported by underlying pretax income margin expansion of nearly 80 basis points for the year.\nThis expansion was driven by positive net pricing, mix impact moderating inflation and cost savings, which more than offset volume deleverage, which had a particularly significant impact in the second half of the year related to U.S. shipment timing. Also contributing to the margin improvement was lower NG&A, largely due to cycling innovative levels in 2023. G&A declines were mostly related to higher incentive compensation in 2023.\nMarketing declines were mainly a result of higher investments in the prior year, particularly in the second half of the year when we increased spend by an incremental $100 million, given the accelerated demand in the U.S. But importantly, we continue to support our brands globally with higher levels of marketing investments for both the quarter and the year as compared to the respective periods in 2022.\nIn addition to investing in our brands and business, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In 2024, we paid $369 million in cash dividends and $643 million to repurchase 10.9 million shares. Since the plan was announced in October 2023, we have repurchased 6.7% of our Class B shares outstanding. It's an up to 5-year $2 billion plan.\nAnd as Gavin mentioned, we have utilized approximately 40% in just the first 5 quarters. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet and our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, which is in line with our long-term target of under 2.5x, and we have no debt coming due in 2025. This provides a significant financial flexibility, offering more optionality in the ways that we invest in the business, we are through capital investments that drive productivity improvements, or to bolt-on M&A that support our strategic growth objectives like our recent investment in Fiber.\nIt also provides us the opportunity to return even more cash to shareholders. And we are pleased to share that today we announced our quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share to be paid on March 14. This is an increase of 6.8% and represents our fourth consecutive year of increases. Clearly demonstrating our attention to sustainably increase our dividend.\nAnd now I'll conclude with our financial outlook. For 2025, we are issuing guidance that is in line with our long-term growth algorithm. However, the global met by environment is rapidly evolving, resulting in uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impact from consumer trends. As a result, our outlook does not reflect the impact of these activities or any imposition of import tariffs by the U.S. and potential retaliatory actions by other countries.\nAlso, please remember that net sales revenue and underlying pretax income growth guidance are on a constant currency basis and underlying earnings per share or not. Therefore, continued strength in the U.S. dollar will result in a headwind to our reported results as well as underlying earnings per share growth and in the effective period using the current exchange rates.\nWith that speed, let's review our guidance metrics. Low single-digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis, mid-single-digit underlying pretax income growth on a constant currency basis. High single-digit underlying earnings per share growth, underlying free cash flow of $1.3 billion, plus or minus 10%. Underlying depreciation and amortization of $675 million, plus or minus 5%.\nNet interest expense of $215 million plus or minus 5%. Underlying effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 24% and capital expenditures incurred of $750 million, plus or minus 5%. Drivers that underpin our guidance include anticipated annual net price increases of 1% to 2% in North America, in line with the average historical range and for other markets to trend in line with inflation.\nMix should be a meaningful growth driver as we advance toward our medium-term goal of reaching about 1/3 of our global net brand revenue from our above premium portfolio. We expect this to come from continued premiumization in EMEA, APAC and Canada as well as progress in the U.S., where, as Gavin shared, we are starting to see some initial traction with Blue Moon. A big chance for Peroni and standing in non-alc.\nWhile Fever tree and the consolidation of ZOA provide incremental benefits to the top line, we will also be cycling revenue from the smaller regional craft breweries we divested in the third quarter and more significantly 2024 PEPs and Labatt contract brewing volume as these contracts terminated at the end of last year. On a combined basis, we expect to relate to approximate $1.9 million hectoliter headwind to Americas financial volume in 2025. We produced about 1.2 million hectares of PEP in the U.S. and 700,000 hectoliters of Labatt brands in Canada in 2024.\nGiven the PEPS volumes wound down sequentially over the course of 2024, the headwind is more pronounced in the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter. And the 2024 Labatt volumes follow typical seasonal trends. There are several additional shipment phasing considerations. In the first quarter, we are cycling particularly strong demand for core power brands in the U.S. in the prior year period when U.S. brand volumes were up 5.7%.\nAlso, in the first quarter of 2024, we benefited from higher than typical inventory build given our anticipation of the Fort Worth strike. This contributed to U.S. financial volume increasing 7.6% in the first quarter of 2024 despite the exit of 350,000 hectoliters of PEPs volume. This higher than typical inventory bold extended into the second quarter of 2024, and we do not anticipate a similar level of first half inventory bold in 2025.\nTurning to costs. In the first quarter, we anticipate incurring onetime transition and integration fees related to the Fever tree partnership, which will be reported in our underlying results. The costs will be determined over the next few months based on discussions which are ongoing. We also expect full year margin expansion coming from a number of drivers.\nThey include mix benefits from lower contract brewing and increased premiumization, moderating inflation on input costs and productivity improvements and cost savings. We also expect to continue to put the right commercial pressure behind our brands globally, focusing on retaining existing customers and attracting new ones.\nGiven our deep capabilities and return oriented strategy, our growth outlook does not require us to make step changes in our marketing investments. In closing, we are pleased with our progress in 2024. We believe we have the right strategy and with strong brands, a highly cash-generative business model and a healthy balance sheet, we have the ability to continue to invest in our business to achieve long-term financial growth and our strategic goals.\nWhile also returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and a meaningful share repurchase program. With that, we would like to open it up to your questions. Operator?"

With that, I'll hand it over to Traci Mangini, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nTraci Mangini\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, ChannelAdvisor Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks today, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Also, I encourage you to review our earnings release and earnings slides, which are posted to the IR section of our website and provide detailed financial and operational metrics.\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.\nReconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we discuss are versus the comparable prior year period and are in U.S. dollars. With the exception of earnings per share, all financial metrics are in constant currency when referencing percentage changes from the prior year period. Also, shared data references are sourced from Circana in the U.S. and from Beer Canada in Canada, unless otherwise indicated.\nFurther, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income, which equates to underlying income before income taxes, and underlying earnings per share, which equates to underlying diluted earnings per share as defined in our earnings release.\nWith that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin Hattersley\n\nCEO of US Business, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Traci. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. We are pleased with our results this quarter, which played out largely as we had expected. We acknowledge that there are a few near-term timing dynamics impacting our quarter-to-quarter performance this year. In today's call, we will unpack these as well as the drivers of the second half of the year to demonstrate why we are maintaining our guidance for the full year 2024.\nIn the second quarter, we essentially held our top line and grew our bottom line while cycling a very difficult year-over-year comparison. If you recall, the second quarter of 2023 was our strongest second quarter net sales revenue since the 2005 Molson and Coors merger. Consolidated net sales revenue was down 0.1%. Underlying pretax income grew 5.2%, and underlying earnings per share grew 7.9%, while we continue to invest behind our brands globally heading into peak season.\nWe also accelerated the pace of share repurchases for the quarter given compelling valuation as we see it, amid the strong performance of the business and our confidence in our long-term algorithm.\nContributing meaningfully to our results was our EMEA and APAC business due to favorable net pricing, premiumization and brand volume growth. For the first half of the year, we increased net sales revenue by 4.2%, underlying pretax income by 20.4% and underlying earnings per share by 23.8%.\nWhile this is a very strong performance year-over-year, there are a few timing factors that will impact us in the third and fourth quarters, which is why we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. These timing factors will result in an unwind in the back half of the year and the resulting temporary trends are not reflective in any way of our confidence in our acceleration plan and growth initiatives. The most important timing factor to understand regarding our performance in the first and second halves of the year is U.S. shipment timing.\nWe made the deliberate decision to increase our U.S. inventories in anticipation of and during the strike at our Fort Worth brewery, which ran 14 weeks during February through May. We did this to ensure we had healthy inventories during the peak summer season. As a result, excluding contract volumes, STWs exceeded STRs by about 750,000 hectoliters in the first quarter and by about 350,000 hectoliters in the second quarter. And we continue to expect this will essentially fully unwind the third and fourth quarters with more weighting to the third quarter.\nAnother factor impacting our results is the continued exit of the Pabst contract brewing volume as we approach the termination of the agreement at year-end. This reduced second quarter financial volume by 580,000 hectoliters with declines accelerating from the first quarter. Introduced our first half financial volume by over 900,000 hectoliters, which represents a decline in Pabst contract volumes of over 50% from the first half of 2023.\nTo put a finer point on it, Pabst has had a negative 3.2 percentage point impact on both our second quarter and first half America's financial volume on a year-over-year basis. And while Pabst is a near-term headwind to total volume and net sales revenue, the mix benefits related to the exit along with favorable global net pricing and premiumization in EMEA and APAC drove an increase in consolidated net sales revenue per hectoliter of 4.2% for both the quarter and for the first half.\nTurning to cash flow. We generated $505 million in underlying free cash flow for the first half of the year, while investing meaningfully in our business. And we returned $564 million in cash to shareholders through both our dividend and share repurchase program. Tracey will cover more on our capital allocation and outlook drivers. But to sum it up, given our strong performance for the first half of the year, we remain on track to deliver our 2024 guidance. This guidance caused the top and bottom line growth for the third straight year something that has not been done in over a decade.\nNow let me take you through our strategic priorities, starting with our core power brands. In the U.S. Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet with second quarter combined volume share is down 0.5 share point of industry versus a year ago when we saw our peak share gains. However, these brands remain up 2 full share points compared to the second quarter of 2022. This means that we retained approximately 80% of our peak share gains on our core power brands.\nCoors Banquet, in particular, is performing extremely well. We have deliberately built on this 150-year-old brand over the last several years building on its loyal consumer base and attracting new Gen Z and millennial legal drinking age consumers. And the results have been impressive. Coors Banquet grew brand volume nearly 13% in the first half of the year and gained dollar share at the fastest rate among the top 15 brands in the beer category, and we see great potential ahead as we continue to close distribution gaps and increased brand awareness.\nIn Canada, Coors Banquet continues to be the #2 brand in the country and the Molson's family of brands gained volume share in both the 3 months and year-to-date ended May. In fact, in Ontario, Coors Light and Molson Canadian continue to be the #1 and #2 brand, respectively, in both the 3 months and year-to-date ended May.\nIn EMEA and APAC, strong results in Central and Eastern Europe have been supported by Ozujsko in Croatia, which has gained nearly 2 value share points of the core segment year-to-date in June, as well as the extremely successful launch of a new core power brand, Caraiman in Romania, reaching about 150,000 hectoliters since March. And Carling's brand equity continued to benefit from its partnership with the FA Cup.\nTurning to our premiumization priority for both beer and beyond beer, our above premium portfolio was over 26% of total net brand revenue for the 12 months ended June 30. Our premiumization progress is at different stages across our markets, and we have had success in EMEA and APAC, Canada and Latin America.\nIn EMEA and APAC, our Above Premium share of net brand revenue continues to be over 50%, up nearly 10 percentage points from the full year 2019. This improvement is primarily due to the very successful launch of Madri, which continued to grow revenue double digits in the second quarter. And it is the #3 lager in the on-premise in the U.K. in terms of value. In the Americas, our above premium share of net brand revenue was over 21% for the 12 months ended June 30, which is up nearly 2 percentage points from the full year 2019.\nThis was supported by Canada, where our above premium share of net brand revenue has also grown driven by the success of Miller Lite, Coors Seltzer and Vizzy. Also contributing to the mix is Latin America, where more than 3/4 of our net brand revenue is above premium. In the U.S., our net brand revenue share from above premium has improved compared to 2019, but our above premium trends have been more challenged recently. And we have work to do here.\nNow this is largely due to the strong performance of our core power brands in 2023, but we believe we can build from here, and we have focused plans around our key above premium brands and innovations to do just that. This starts with the Blue Moon family performance, and we feel good about our new campaign in packaging, our repositioning at Blue Moon Light as well as our line extensions into non-alc. It's early, but we believe we are moving in the right direction.\nWe are committed to continuing to innovate and scale in beyond beer, which for us is all about above premium. Flavor is a key focus area because it's big and it's growing. Given the flavor consumer evolves and shift quickly, flavor innovation is key to keeping pace with their demands. We believe we have impactful brands with potential in the space. For example, we have built Simply Spiked into a $100 million brand in just 2 years, illustrating the power of the Molson Coors platform as a launch pad for innovation and growing brands.\nAnd while we have seen some softening on our original packs as we launched into new flavors. With the Simply brand in 1 out of every 2 households in the U.S., we believe the Simply Spiked brand family has more runway. And we have exciting plans for Peroni by onshoring production in the U.S., we believe we can better ensure consistency of supply and ultimately drive scale and margin for this high potential brand.\nBefore I pass it to Tracey, I'll conclude by saying that we are confident we have the right strategy to achieve our long-term growth objectives, and we are very pleased with our progress against our strategy. We are a much different company today than we were 4 years ago, and we are most certainly stronger than we were just 16 months ago.\nWith that, I will pass it to Tracey.\n\nTracey Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin. We reported another strong quarter of financial performance and continue to expect we will achieve our goal of growing the top and bottom line for the third year in a row. As Gavin mentioned, with our strong free cash flow generation, we continue to invest strategically in our business and also return cash to shareholders. Since October 2019, when we launched the initial phase of a new strategy, we have invested substantially in our capabilities. From supply chain to marketing, to technology and tools that advance our insights and analytics.\nThese investments have driven substantial cost savings, which helped to offset inflationary pressures and support long-term sustainable profitable growth. In recent years, this has included adding [indiscernible] production and co-packing capabilities, expanding and diversifying our supplier base. building slim can capacity in our can plant and replacing several breweries with state-of-the-art facilities in Canada.\nIn the first half of this year, a big focus has been our multiyear, multi-hundred million dollar modernization of our Golden Colorado Brewery which is nearing completion. This project at our largest U.S. brewery, which broke ground in the fall of 2020, is completely overhauling the brewery infrastructure and is expected to result in more efficient fermenting, aging and for filtration facilities as well as a state-of-the-art upgrade to the sellers. When it is fully operational in a few weeks' time, we will have a more efficient brewery that produces less waste.\nWe also commenced a new multiyear project in the U.K. to increase our brewing and packaging capacity, which is necessary in part due to the continued growth of Madri. And with these investments along with our extensive hedging program that helped us to offset inflation, particularly during the significant inflation period we have experienced in recent years.\nAnd while inflation has moderated, as expected, it remains a headwind this year. In the second quarter, our COGS per hectoliter increased 2.9%, which was driven by the Americas business, which is up 4.1%. This was largely due to ongoing inflationary pressure as well as volume deleverage in part due to the reduced Pabst contract brewing volume in the Americas business.\nTurning to marketing capabilities. We overhauled our marketing strategy several years ago, making us more nimble and efficient as we have continued to invest behind our brands. By improving our ability to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing investments, we are able to assist our campaigns in almost real time. And we built our own in-house agencies enabling us to meaningfully shift up the percentage of spend to more working versus nonworking marketing dollars.\nIt's our deep marketing capabilities that have enabled us to meaningfully improve our return on marketing investment since 2019 and support why our long-term growth algorithm does not onstage step changes in marketing spend.\nAs for returning cash to shareholders in the first half of this year, we paid $188 million in cash dividends. And in February, we raised the dividend for the third consecutive year, a cumulative 29.4% increase. As such, we are generating a dividend yield of 3.2% as of [ August 30 ]. Also, we are active in executing against our up to 5-year $2 billion share repurchase program that we announced last October. We continue to view our stock as a compelling investment opportunity amid the strong performance of the business and our confidence in our long-term growth algorithm.\nAnd utilizing a sustained and opportunistic approach, we repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total cost of $260.7 million in the quarter. Since inception of the plan, we have already repurchased 8.8 million shares or 4.4% of our Class B shares outstanding since September 30, 2023, for a total cost of $521.1 million. That means we have completed approximately 26% of the plan in just the first 3 quarters.\nAnd the reason we've been able to deploy our capital in these ways is because our balance sheet is strong and healthy, healthier than it has been since before the 2016 MillerCoors acquisition. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.13x, which remained in line with our long-term target range of less than 2.5x. In May, we issued EUR 800 million notes at a fixed rate of 3.8% and used the proceeds to pay down our EUR 800 million note upon its maturity in July.\nAnd now I'd like to conclude with our financial outlook. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance. As a reminder, the key metrics for low single-digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis, mid-single-digit underlying pretax income growth on a constant currency basis, mid-single-digit underlying earnings per share growth and underlying free cash flow of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%. While this guidance implies lower trends for the second half of the year, it's important to remember that this is driven by shipment timing this year, and it does not alter our confidence in our long-term growth expectations.\nAs Gavin discussed, in the U.S., excluding contract volumes, we deliberately shipped ahead of demand by about 1.1 million hectoliters in the first half of the year. This compares to the first half of 2023 when our STWs were behind our STR by about 400,000 hectoliters. And since we currently tend to shift to consumption for the year, we expect this to reverse in the second half, mostly in the third quarter.\nAt the same time, our contract with Pabst continues to wind down, recall that we expected the impact for the year from the Pabst contract termination to be approximately 2 million hectoliters or about 3% of America's financial value.\nThere is about 1 million hectoliters remaining that will come out of our system in the second half of the year, with over half of that expected to exit in the third quarter. The U.S. shipment trends are expected to result in volume deleverage in the second half of the year. And recall that we had a volume leverage benefit on a consolidated basis, up about 50 basis points in the comparable period in 2023.\nFor some perspective, on a consolidated basis, we estimate that our fixed costs in 2024 will comprise approximately [ 25% ] of our total cost. However, the anticipated benefits of [indiscernible] pricing taken in the first quarter, premiumization of our portfolio, moderating inflation and cost savings should partially offset the impact of volume deleverage.\nAnd we expect SG&A for the second half to be down compared to the prior year period, as we tackle the second half of 2023 when we had high market investment to support the momentum in our brand as well as higher incentive compensation.\nAs we look to the longer term, we remain confident in our growth algorithm, as we have multiple levers to achieve it. From a robust revenue management platform, to our premiumization and innovation plans, to our continued investment to drive efficiencies and cost savings, these levers help us to navigate various market circumstances.\nIn closing, we had another strong financial quarter and remain committed to our short- and long-term financial and strategic goals.\nAnd with that, I'd like to open it up to your questions.

Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. GAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our earnings release.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year. Also, U.S. share data references are sourced from Sircana, unless otherwise indicated. Further, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income which equates to underlying income before income taxes as defined in our earnings release. So with that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin Hattersley\n\nCEO of US Business, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us this morning. In the first quarter, Molson Coors once again delivered against our commitments, growing the top and bottom line while making strong progress on our acceleration plan. We grew net sales revenue by over 10%. And we grew underlying pretax income by nearly 69%, and we drove significant margin improvement in the first quarter. This morning, we reaffirmed our full year guidance, which Tracey will discuss in more detail shortly.\nTo sum it up, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top and bottom line for a third consecutive year, but cautious about current trends in the industry. The U.S. beer category has been challenged so far this year. While we did see some improvement in March, there was also volatility in the industry and mismatched weeks such as Easter. So we're keeping a close eye on April's trends and taking those into account for the balance of 2024.\nIn spite of this volatility, we remain confident in our ability to achieve top and bottom line growth in 2024. We also remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth algorithm. In the first quarter, we grew brand volume and net sales per hectoliter in both business units, and our share gains in the U.S. were consistent with the gains we saw in the second half of 2023. Having said that, we aren't the only ones who are confident in our business. Retailers are also confident, having allocated around 13% more space for Coors Light and Miller Lite in the U.S. during spring resets. Which supports our confidence that these share shifts are structural.\nOur distributors are also confident, which is why we expect our core brands to grow distribution this year. And across the globe, we have strong commercial platforms that are designed to serve our brands in 2024 and the years to come. With that, let's get into how our business performed in the first quarter. And I'll start with the first priority of our acceleration plan, growing the revenue of our core brands.\nCollectively, our core brand started 2024 strong including double-digit brand volume growth for Coors Light and Coors Banquet in the U.S., high single-digit brand volume growth for Miller Lite in the U.S. and double-digit brand volume growth for Ozujsko in Croatia. In the past 4 months, we've launched new long-term campaigns across our core brands, starting with Coors Light during Super Bowl. Shortly thereafter, in the U.S., Coors Light became the top dollar share gainer year-to-date in the on-premise per Nielsen. Miller Lite is a close second and their combined success has fueled 12 consecutive 4-week periods of industry-leading on-premise growth for Molson Coors, 4x more growth than the next largest competitor.\nIn Canada, Coors Light is seeing similar success and grew nearly a full share point of the industry year-to-date. As I hinted earlier, Coors Light momentum is anchored by our new campaign Choose To. This is an evolution of Coors Light's Made to Chill campaign, which helped turn the brand around.\nBut Choose Chill is more active for consumers and more connected to the refreshment and lifestyle Coors Light represents. You'll continue to see those Choose Chill as we launch a new music program this summer and expand Coors Light's presence in soccer and football.\nWe believe work like this has driven Coors to become a trusted and desirable brand for consumers, which is true for Coors Banquet as well. After growing brand volume by nearly 20% in 2023 in the U.S. Banquet grew volume by 23% in the first quarter and gained nearly 0.25 point of industry dollar share. I've already spoken about spring resets. But while we're talking about Banquet, I want to share the significant distribution growth we've seen for this brand and expect to continue seeing moving forward.\nIn 2024, Banquet is expected to grow distribution by nearly 20%, driven by surging demand in parts of the U.S. where Banquet has historically under-indexed like the Southeast and great Lakes. This is what happens when consumer demand fuels distributor and retailer confidence. This year, we plan to keep driving Banquet with more television media pressure, TV advertising for the first time in several years and several large programs with current and new partners across television, music and apparel.\nTurning to Miller Lite, which grew its U.S. brand volume by high single digits in the first quarter on top of strong comps from the prior year. In March, Miller Lite launched its new All Stars program, reinvigorating the debate about where the Miller Lite taste great is less filling or both. This campaign brought on a new roster of long-term celebrity partners like J.J. Watt, Regie Miller, Big Puppy, [indiscernible] Mia Hamm.\nThe early response has been very strong, and we have more planned for the Olympics, Major League Baseball and football. Now in Canada, Miller Lite sales is an above premium price point. And year-to-date through February, it was the fastest growing above premium beer nationally, growing its brand volume by over 40%. Speaking of Canada, the Molson trademark also outperformed the industry and gained volume share. In March, we announced a multiyear partnership with the professional women's Hockey League, which was very positively received by fans and retailers alike.\nSimilar to other women's sports, viewership for the PWHL has surged this year with broadcast and in-person attendance, both at record highs. We're excited to continue this partnership and Molson will also have a strong presence at the Olympics this summer as the official beer sponsor of Team Canada. Moving on to the U.K, Carling's partnership with the FA Cup began coming to life across TV, digital and retail in the first quarter. And we believe this is the perfect sponsorship that [indiscernible] up for sustained success.\nAccording to our data, Carling is more associated with professional soccer than any other beer in the market. At a 35% association, it's nearly double the next competitor. Rounding out our core is Ozujsko which has continued its strong momentum in Croatia and now has a 54% value share of the core segment. Ozujsko is much loved locally, but also by the many travelers who visit Croatia each year, and we've just launched a new equity campaign nationally to continue growing the brand.\nSo our core brands have collectively continued to perform strongly in 2024, and we believe we have the right commercial plans to keep them growing for years to come. Now turning to our high-end brands. It's clear we have lots of runway in every part of our portfolio. In the first quarter, Madri Excepcional continued its substantial growth. In the U.K., the brand grew value sales of the on-trade by nearly 50% and value sales of the off-trade by over 40%.\nMadri is currently the #3 world beer in the U.K. total trade, and we have been consistently closing the gap to #2 to keep the pressure on, we launched a new campaign in April that brings the soul of Madri to the U.K. and focuses on growing Madri's awareness. While Madri continues to grow at a strong base in the U.K., you'll recall we also brought the brand to Canada in late February. And while it's still early days, Madri has already made it into about 6,000 accounts across the country, we believe the brand is performing very well so far. Beyond Madri's success, there are other parts of our [ Heine ] portfolio that we're actively working to improve, specifically Blue Moon. Between February and March, we launched new Blue Moon packaging in the U.S., a new name for Blue Moon Light and a large-scale campaign called Made Brighter.\nSo our full-scale revamp has taken shape. And while it's too early to know the full effect we are seeing early signs of positive traction. We're also seeing great performance for Blue Moon non-alc, which is now the top-selling new non-alc beer of 2024. There have been about 30 non-alc beer launches in the U.S. this year as well as increasing competition. So there is a truly strong sign as the brand continues to gain distribution and share.\nWhile we certainly have more to do on Blue Moon, we are committed to driving the turnaround, and we are happy with the progress thus far. Speaking of progress, it was a fast start to the year for Simply Spiked, which grew U.S. brand volume by nearly 35% in the quarter. Simply Spiked Limeade hit shelves in February. And while we are still growing distribution, our variety pack already holds the #1 new item spot for the flavored alternative segment since its launch.\nSimply Spiked had a major media presence during March Madness, along with Coors Light and Miller Lite, we'll continue to focus on sports as a primary [ passion ] point for [some despite] consumers throughout the year. And while it's still early days for our new brand, Happy Thursday, which just launched in April, we've seen a very positive response from consumers so far, and we look forward to building the brand as we approach the peak summer selling season.\nSo as you can see, we are delivering on our long-term commitment to grow the revenue of our core power brands with strong overall performance across the world. We are delivering with the strength of high-end brands like Simply Spiked and Madri Excepcional and we are beginning to see positive traction on other key areas of our high-end portfolio, such as Blue Moon. And finally, we are delivering on our commitment to enhance our capabilities with a large investment in our Golden Brewery nearing completion and a $100 million investment plan for our U.K. operations over the next 5 years, which we believe will ensure world-class production of our brands today and in the future.\nWe are committed to our overall long-term strategy. We have delivered against it over the last 3 years, and we plan to continue delivering against it year-over-year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tracey to share some details on our financials and drivers of our guidance.\n\nTracey Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin. We are proud to report another strong quarter. Net sales revenue grew an impressive 10.1% on strong Americas volume and favorable net pricing across both business units. This top line strength, coupled with volume leverage and ongoing cost savings drove meaningful margin expansion, while we continue to invest strongly behind our brands. As a result, underlying pretax income grew 68.8%. Now many of the details can be found in our earnings release and slides, so I'll focus on our prepared remarks on some of the key metrics and drivers of our quarterly performance, and our outlook for the year.\nOur double-digit top line growth was driven by both volume and price mix. As planned, we executed global net pricing increases in the quarter. We also had favorable mix, which was driven by lower Pabst contract brewing volumes. This led to a 4.2% increase in net sales per hectoliter driven by both business units. Financial volume grew 5.7%, driven by the Americas. In the U.S., financial volume increased 7.6% despite an approximate 3% or nearly 350,000 hectoliter Americas headwind related to the exit of low-margin Pabst contract brewing volume.\nOur U.S. domestic shipments benefited not only from continued strong demand but also shipment timing. We typically build inventories in the first quarter ahead of peak season. But this year, we built more than usual in the U.S. This was due to elevated consumer demand and measures taken under our contingency plan related to the Fort Worth brewery strike that commenced in mid-February.\nFor context, this year, our first quarter shipments to distributors exceeded brand volume by over 750,000 hectoliters. While in the prior year, first quarter shipments exceeded brand volumes by roughly 100,000 hectoliters. This U.S. shipment timing was a driver in the financial volume growth exceeding brand volume growth. Consolidated band volume growth was 4.4%, with growth in both business units. Americas growth was led by the U.S., which was up 5.8%.\nThe growth was driven by continued strength of our core brands, the Coors Light and Banquet each up double digits and Miller Lite up high single digits. In addition, our key innovations, like Simply Spiked also grew. Canada also contributed to brand volume growth. While the Canadian industry has improved since the fourth quarter, it remains challenged. So we continue to take meaningful volume share, increasing brand volume by 3.6%, driven by our above premium portfolio.\nIn EMEA and APAC, brand volume increased 1.9%, driven by growth in Central and Eastern Europe as inflation pressures ease, partially offset by challenges in the U.K. off-premise. Turning to costs. Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter was up a modest 0.9%. Inflation while moderating, continued to be a headwind but was largely offset by 110 basis point benefit from volume leverage. The volume leverage was driven by the Americas business, This, along with lower logistics costs more than offset the impacts of direct materials and manufacturing inflation, which resulted in Americas underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter being essentially flat.\nIn EMEA and APAC, underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 3.3%, which was a significant improvement from last year. The increase was due to higher direct materials and logistics costs as well as premiumization of our portfolio. We continue to invest strongly behind our brands globally, increasing marketing spend for our core power brands in particular.\nThis included showing up in a big way in live sports at the Super Bowl, March Madness and the FA Cup as well as supporting the launch of the new Blue Moon campaign. Turning to capital allocation. We deployed $144 million in capital projects, which support ongoing productivity and cost savings programs as well as our sustainability initiatives.\nOur Golden Brewery modernization project, which is nearing completion, is a great example of this. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. We raised our quarterly dividend again by 7% and we're active in executing our $2 billion share repurchase program that was announced last October. Utilizing our sustained and opportunistic approach, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total cost of approximately $110 million in the quarter.\nSince the inception of the plan in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have already repurchased 4.3 million shares for a total cost of approximately $260 million. Now let's discuss our outlook. We are reiterating our 2024 guidance given that we are early in the year and in particular, our portion around the U.S. and Canada beer industries, which we have shown -- which have shown accelerated softening in early April, we believe that this is a prudent approach to take.\nNow while the detailed list of metrics is in our earnings release and slides, I'll highlight the primary ones. We continue to expect low single-digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Mid-single-digit underlying pretax income growth on a constant currency basis, mid-single-digit underlying earnings per share growth and underlying free cash flow of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%. Now let's talk about our guidance assumptions.\nOur goal is typically to ship to consumption for the year, and this is true for 2024. So given the strong U.S. domestic shipment volumes in the third quarter resulting in a significant gap between shipment and decisions as I quantified, we expect U.S. brand volumes to exceed shipment volumes during the balance of the year. The termination of the Pabst contract brewing agreement at the end of this year is expected to be a 1.6 million hectoliter headwind to America's financial volumes over the remaining 3 quarters of the year.\nWe expect positive price mix, and we continue to expect pricing in the U.S. and Canada to be between 1% and 2%, in line with historical averages and for pricing in EMEA and APAC to trend in line with inflation. We also expect premiumization supported by our expanding above premium portfolio. This includes brands like Madri with its strong momentum in the U.K., along with its recent expansion into Canada and Bulgaria as well as by anticipated improvements in the Blue Moon brand family.\nIt also includes flavor as we enter the summer with 3 winning flavors for Simply Spiked as well as our new innovations, Happy Thursday. We believe these brands should keep us moving towards our medium-term goal of reaching approximately 1/3 of our global net brand revenue from our above premium portfolio. On the cost side, we expect underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase due to continued, albeit moderating inflationary pressure, including material conversion costs, higher costs related to premiumization, and lower volume leverage impact as compared to 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\nWe continue to expect MG&A for the year to be roughly in line with 2023. This entails strongly supporting our core power brands and key innovations globally. This is especially true around peak season as we lean into media at both local and national levels and with robust retail programming that drives consumer engagement. In summary, our strong momentum in 2023 has continued into 2024. This shows that our strategy is working with strong brands, supportive distributor partners and the financial flexibility to balance growth and reinvestment with confidence in our ability to deliver our guidance in 2024 and on our long-term growth algorithm in the years to come. And with that, we look forward to answering your questions. Operator?"

You can find related slides on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Traci Mangini, Director, Investor Relations.\n\nTraci Mangini\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, ChannelAdvisor Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks today, we look forward to taking your questions. In an effort to address as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with the IR department in the days and weeks that follow. .\nNow today's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. GAAP reconciliations for any U.S. or non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year period. Also, U.S. share data references are sourced from Circana unless otherwise indicated. Further, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income which equates to underlying income before income taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWith that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Traci, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to mention that Tracey Joubert, our Chief Financial Officer, is unable to attend today. We moved our earnings date earlier this year, so I didn't conflict with CAGNY and Tracey had a very long-standing family commitment at this time. So Greg Tierney, our Vice President of FP&A Commercial Finance and Investor Relations, will be filling in on her behalf for this earnings call, and you'll see Tracey next week at CAGNY. .\nAt the start of last year, no one, absolutely, nobody could have predicted what would happen in the beer industry. We are just growing the top and bottom line of this business, and we are committed to doing it again in 2023. We -- since then, we increased our expectations for the full year, not once but twice. We've continued to raise the stakes and I'm proud to say that once again, we have delivered what we said we would.\nIn 2023, our global net revenue grew more than 9%, and we grew our bottom line by nearly 37%. These are our highest reported dollar results on record ever, on top of the already impressive results in 2022. We've proven that Molson Coors is the kind of business that can turn itself around, deliver against its commitments and continue to grow no matter the volatility of the external environment. Every year, for the past 3 years, our industry has faced challenges. We've gotten good at managing them, even when they're massive enough to permanently alter the beer industry. And every year for the past 3 years, we have navigated successfully through the challenges. We have delivered against our vision, and we have grown. But growth is not a strong enough word to describe what we achieved in 2023.\nWe've set a new baseline for our business, and you don't need to look any further than our bottom line. In fact, our 2023 underlying pretax income was higher than we thought it would be, and frankly, higher than anyone I am aware of said would be in 2028. So Molson Coors delivered 6 years of profit growth, 6 years of growth in just 1 year. That focus is a new baseline. We are ready for this moment. So let's get into why we are confident.\nIn 2023, our top 5 brands around the world drove over 2 million more hectoliters than they did the prior year. This is like adding the entirety of Blue Moon's global volume to our portfolio. In the U.S., our core brands are growing distribution and space at retail. And as I will discuss in a minute, we expect to gain significantly more space in the spring. Last year, our brands in the U.S. also grew more share of the on-premise than any other brewer. This includes our core brands, and it also includes growth for Blue Moon. And as of the latest 12-week CGA Nielsen reads, we are going 3x more share in the on-premise than constellation, 3x more.\nTo put this performance into perspective, Coors Light and Miller Lite each grew more dollars in the on-premise than Constellation did as a total brewer. I'll let that sink in for a second. Because of this momentum, we added an incremental $1 billion in distributor revenue to our network in 2023. And our distributors are just as motivated to grow again this year. Perhaps most importantly, the consumers who have come to our portfolio over the past 12 months have stuck with us, and they are more loyal than we have historically seen. So we brought new consumers into our portfolio, we've retained our loyal base and our plans for 2024 are designed specifically to bring in even more new consumers and there's no better place to start than with our core brands.\nLet me start with the U.S. In the fourth quarter, Coors Light, Coors Banquet and Miller Lite all grew brand volume by double digits. Miller Lite [indiscernible] strong into 2022 and still grew 0.5 point of industry dollar share in the fourth quarter. And Coors Light grew dollar share by nearly a full share point in the quarter. You've also heard us talk more about Coors Banquet and for good reason. Brand volume grew by nearly 20% for the full year in 2023, and it has grown industry share for 11 straight quarters. We have a lot of runway on Banquet, especially with younger legal age consumers. We gained more distribution in 2023 and grew on-premise draft lines for Banquet by nearly 50% in the fourth quarter alone. So you can expect to see us putting a lot of focus behind Banquet this year, along with Coors Light and Miller Lite. Coors Light and Miller Lite have grown significantly at retail, gaining more dollar share of displays in 2023 than any other beer brand. And that trend has continued in 2024 and with Coors Light, Coors Banquet and Miller Lite growing dollar share of displays by nearly 20% in the 4 weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. This is an incredibly important point. And the reason why it's quite simple, store shelves and coolers have a finite amount of space. So floor displays represent incremental space and high visibility. This added space also means more days of inventory at retail for our brands. And from a consumer perspective, it means our brands are placed in areas of the store where they're more likely to sell quickly.\nNow we can't talk about our presence at retail without mentioning spring resets. You'll recall that Coors Light and Miller Lite gained about 6% to 7% more space during the summer and fall adjustments, which is a huge increase for brand this large. We're now starting to get a clearer picture of what we can expect again as spring resets take shape. And based on the conversations we're having with top retailers, we expect to gain significantly more distribution and space for our brands in 2024 on top of the gains we made last year. In fact, one of our larger chain retailers has already confirmed at its space that is well above the 4 levels for our core brands this year.\nIt's important to note, though, that this won't happen all at once. Unlike the unprecedented resets we saw last summer [ and 4 ] spring resets are phased between the spring and summer. The impact will likely show up over time, roughly between March and July of 2024. Eating up to those months and throughout our core brands in the U.S. will have large integrated campaigns running across TV, digital, retail and live events. You've already started to see this with Coors Light and the Super Bowl which got a great reaction from consumers and supported our success in the marketplace.\nIn the 4 weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, we added an incremental 160,000 display units of Coors Light at retail. During the same time, Coors Light velocities grew by nearly 14%. So not only are we selling much more beer, it's also selling much faster. As far as what's next, Coors Light's choose Chill campaign will run throughout the year with strong media pressure and amplification from celebrity fans at Grammy award-winning country music star Lainey Wilson.\nAnd in March, we plan to launch a campaign of comparable size for Miller Lite. I can't say much about that right now, but it's some of the best work I've seen on Miller Lite in a long time, and that's a very high bar. So we're excited about it. The growth of our core brands is not limited to the U.S. In our other global markets, we continue to see strong performance and have plans to continue the momentum in 2024.\nIn Ontario, Coors Light and Molson Canadian are now the #1 and #2 beers in the total market, and both brands grew share of the industry in Canada for the full year. Miller Lite, which sells at an above premium price point in Canada continues to grow at a rapid pace with fourth quarter volumes accelerating up nearly 60%. In Croatia, Ožujsko achieved its highest share levels in recorded history and now holds more than a 50% share of segment. In the U.K., Carling grew value share versus its competitive set in the fourth quarter, and we are very excited that Carling is now the first official beer partner of the Men's and Women's FA Cup, which will provide significant visibility and relevance for the brand in 2024.\nSo our core brands have carried their 2023 momentum into this year and the higher end of our portfolio has a lot of runway in 2024 as well. In the fourth quarter, our EMEA and APAC business achieved a record high 52% of our net brand revenue at an above premium price point.\nIn the U.K., Madri Excepcional continued its growth streak. In the fourth quarter, Madri was the fastest-growing major beer brand in the U.K., both by volume and value sales. Madri volumes grew by 80% for the full year, easily surpassing 1 million hectoliters. Growth like this does not come easy in the beer space, especially in less than 3 years for a new to the world brand that launched during a pandemic. We have some expansion with Madri, so it should not be a surprise that we have ambitions to scale this brand and expand its global footprint.\nLast month, we announced that we're launching in Canada, and product is rolling out on to shelves starting this week. We plan to grow this brand thoughtfully in markets where the opportunity and desire are clear. We're starting with Canada and select European markets this year. So that is our focus right now, and we'll consider future expansion when the time is right.\nIn terms of our flavor portfolio, Simply Spiked continues to be a growth engine for our business and the industry. This brand more than doubled its volume in the U.S. in 2023 and Simply Spiked Peach was the #1 innovation by volume and dollar sales in the grocery channel. Simply Spiked is also going ground in Canada, we had launched nationally less than a year ago. Already, it has nearly a 4% share of a statement in a matter of months. And along with brands like Quirk Seltzer and Vizzy, it has driven Molson Coors to become the only major brewer growing share of flavor in Canada. We plan to continue our growth in flavor this year, but our approach will be focused and deliberate.\nWe're launching Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. this month. And in March, our new-to-the-world innovation happy Thursday would hit shelves and e-commerce platforms across the U.S. We've gotten great responses from retailers for both of these launches, and we plan to support them with strong marketing and sampling activations in every region of the country this spring and summer. So we are very confident we can go off our tremendous results in 2023, and we are very confident in the momentum of our brands and our plans for 2024. So you can be confident that we're going to deliver what we say we will deliver, just as we have for the past few years. We are confident because we've weathered every recent challenge imaginable challenges in our industry and challenges in the macro environment. And from that perspective, we continue to see signs of improvement.\nCountry to conventional wisdom, U.S. beer industry volume trends improved during 2023 and particularly in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with strong improvements in consumer spending. In fact, the overall beer category gained dollar share of total alcohol beverage in 2023. Our brands led the industry volume improvement during 2023. And we are focused on our position as the leader of this industry. So we plan to grow Molson Coors top line again in 2024.\nAre we cautious about the year ahead, of course, while inflation has come down, there are still plenty of reasons to be wary about the macro environment. But our strong results give us confidence in our ability to deliver in 2024. I know a number of you remain skeptical of our ability to grow this year. We were skeptical in 2022 and also in 2023, but the numbers don't lie. We delivered what we said we would. So for 2024, here's what I will say, we are committed to growth. And for the long term, we have shared our growth algorithm, and we intend to deliver on it, just as we have delivered on what we have said we would over the past 4 years.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Greg to share some details on our financials and our guidance. Greg?\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVice President of FP&A and Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Gavin. 2023 was an incredible year for our company. Our net sales revenue grew an impressive 9.3% with strong growth from both business units. Top line performance was driven by favorable global net pricing, Americas volume growth and positive sales mix. Our above premium portfolio comprised 27% of total net brand revenue for the year, and that was with a tremendous strength in our core power brands. In fact, our above premium brand in our above premium brands grew net brand revenue by 6% for the year, behind successful innovations like Simply Spiked and continued growth in Madri Financial volume increased 1.8%, while brand volume grew 2.2%.\nOur supply chain team did an outstanding job in meeting the high consumer demand in the U.S., leading to financial volume growth of 3.5% and brand volume growth of 5.3% in the year. And we delivered strong margin expansion as cost savings and volume leverage significantly offset inflationary pressures and higher MG&A spend.\nAs a result, underlying pretax income grew 36.9%, also driven by both business units and exceeded our expectations. Underlying free cash flow climbed to $1.4 billion, also exceeding our expectations. This enabled us to continue to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our balance sheet, raised dividend 8% and repurchased approximately 150 million shares under our new share repurchase program that we announced in October.\nSo as Gavin discussed, we've entered 2024 with a strong foundation. This gives us confidence for continued growth in 2024, which aligns with our long-term growth algorithm for net sales revenue and underlying pretax income. But before we get into our outlook, let's discuss the fourth quarter. Both business units contributed a solid top line growth of 5%. Underlying pretax income increased 2.1% as we continue to invest strongly behind our brands, which is particularly impactful to the bottom line in a typically lower profit quarter.\nNow looking closer at the top line. Favorable net pricing and sales mix drove net sales per hectoliter growth of 4.2%. Favorable sales mix was due to lower contract brewing volume related to the wind down of the PET agreement ahead of its termination at the end of 2024. Consolidated financial volume increased 0.8% as growth in Americas was offset by declines in EMEA and APAC.\nAmericas shipments increased 2.2% with U.S. domestic shipments up 4.3%, driven by the strength of our core premium brands. However, as expected, lower contract brewing volume related to the PET's agreement was a headwind of approximately 2% to America's shipment volume. And also recall that in the third quarter of 2023 due to our strong U.S. brewery performance, we shipped ahead of expectations. So we entered the fourth quarter with healthy U.S. inventory levels. This allowed us to give our employees some well-deserved time off during the holidays and to conduct routine system maintenance well positioning us to build inventory in the first quarter ahead of peak season.\nEMEA and APAC financial volume declined 3% on lower brand volumes. Consolidated brand volume growth was 4.3%. As expected, growth accelerated versus the third quarter and underscored the continued strong momentum of our core brands. Now looking by market, Americas brand volume increased 6.7%. That was led by the U.S. where brand volumes were up 8.5%. Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet performed strongly, each up double digits.\nIn Canada, brand volume increased 0.7%, benefiting from growth in our above premium portfolio. While industry softness weighed on brand volume, we continue to grow share in Canada for the quarter adding nearly 2 share points for the quarter. That was the strongest growth of any major brewer in the country. And in Latin America, while mix improved, brand volume was down 5%. This was largely due to challenging economic conditions in some of our key markets in the region. In EMEA and APAC, brand volume declined 2.2%. This was due to industry softness in the U.K. off-premise which partially offset the strength of our above premium portfolio and inflation continued to pressure Central and Eastern European performance.\nNow turning to costs. Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter was up 1.4% with notable differences by market. As expected, inflation was a headwind in the quarter, partially offset by cost savings and a 30 basis point benefit from volume leverage. In the Americas, underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 0.7% as cost savings, volume leverage, lower logistics costs more than offset the impact of direct materials inflation.\nIn EMEA and APAC, we continue to see persistent inflationary pressure with underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter up 8.8%. These increases were driven by direct material materials and logistics costs as well as unfavorable mix from premiumization. Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 17.4%. We invested strongly behind our brands, increasing marketing spend over $50 million in the quarter. Our focus was on retaining our existing drinkers and attracting new ones including using addressable channels or places where we can use data to more precisely target them and continuing our push behind live sports.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were also higher as variable compensation expense reflected the strong operating performance for the year. Underlying free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 66.5% for the year. This exceeded our expectations, in part due to the timing of working capital movements at the end of the year. Utilizing our strong free cash flow and given our greatly improved financial flexibility, we continue to deploy capital in ways that we believe will drive the greatest shareholder value.\nWe continue to invest in the business, putting to work approximately $690 million in capital projects like the Golden Brewery modernization and investing in capabilities to drive efficiencies, cost savings and sustainability. And we supported our strategic growth initiatives under our string-of-pearls approach with bolt-on acquisitions like Blue Run Spirits and upping our investment in ZOA. We continue to delever our balance sheet with a cash repayment of $500 million in Canadian debt upon its maturity in July, coupled with higher cash balances, we ended the year with net debt of $5.4 billion down over $600 million for the year.\nGiven this and our strong underlying EBITDA, net debt to underlying EBITDA was 2.2x at year-end, aligned with our long-term goal of under 2.5x. Underscoring our enhanced financial strength, we're pleased to have earned credit rating upgrades from our ratings agencies in the fourth quarter. In October, S&P Global upgraded Molson Coors to BBB and in November, Moody's upgraded us to BAA2. We continue to return cash to shareholders. In 2023, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.64 per share and up 8% from 2022. And today, as part of our intention to sustainably increase the dividend, we announced our quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share to be paid on March 15, 2024, and this represents an increase of 7%.\nNow lastly, as announced in our Strategy Day on October 3, our Board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2 billion over the next 5 years. Under our sustained and opportunistic approach, we were active in the market during a 2-month open window in the period, repurchasing approximately 2.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $150 million. This equates to a repurchase of over 1% of our outstanding shares in roughly 2 months.\nNow let's turn to our outlook. For 2024, we are issuing guidance of low single-digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis, mid-single-digit underlying pretax income growth on a constant currency basis. Mid-single-digit underlying earnings per share growth, underlying free cash flow of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%, underlying depreciation and amortization of $700 million, plus or minus 5%. Net interest expense of $210 million, plus or minus 5%, an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% and capital expenditures incurred of $750 million plus or minus 5%.\nNow let me walk through some of the underlying assumptions. We expect annual net pricing to revert to historical levels. In the U.S. and Canada, that's been approximately 1% to 2%, while in Europe is typically priced closer in line with inflation. We also expect mix benefits from premiumization as we advance toward our medium-term goal of reaching approximately 1/3 of our total global net brand revenue from above premium portfolio. Financial volume is expected to be impacted by the [indiscernible] contract brewing arrangement, which terminates at the end of this year is expected to be a headwind of approximately 3% or 2 million hectoliters to America's financial volume with the wind-down continuing throughout the year. Additionally, we anticipate financial volume performance to be strongest in the first quarter as we build inventories coming into peak season in the U.S.\nGross profit is expected to increase driven by mix and cost savings. While inflationary pressure is expected to moderate from 2023, we expect that underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter will increase due to a combination of continued inflation, including material conversion costs, higher costs related to premiumization and lower volume leverage as compared to 2023.\nAlso, while spot prices are currently lower than they have been over the past 2 years, recall that we have a longer-term hedging program, and as a result, we expect to experience a headwind in 2024 from certain commodity hedges put in place in 2022 and 2023. We do not anticipate significant changes in total MG&A and plan to put the right commercial pressure behind our brands and key innovations. We'll do this through strong media plans at both the local and national level through live sports, including another Super Bowl commercial and through robust retail programming that drives consumer engagement.\nG&A is expected to face an easier comparison given the increase in incentive compensation in 2023 related to the significant outperformance versus our initial plan. Underlying earnings per share growth is the one metric that is below our long-term growth algorithm. This is largely due to a higher forecasted underlying effective tax rate. Underlying free cash flow guidance is impacted by working capital timing that benefited 2023 as well as slightly higher capital expenditures.\nSo in summary, we're very proud of our performance in 2023. We enter 2024 with strong brands, an exciting innovation pipeline, compelling programming, strong and supportive distributor partners more retailer shelf space and [indiscernible] and the financial flexibility to balance growth and reinvestment. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024 and in the years to come.\nWith that, we look forward to answering your questions. Operator?"

You can find related slides on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website. Our speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer. And with that, I'll hand it over to Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A, Merchant Finance and Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVice President of FP&A and Investor Relations\n\nAll right. Thank you, Brita, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. In an effort to address as many questions as possible, we ask you to -- we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with our IR team in the days and weeks that follow. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. GAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year period. Also, U.S. share data references are sourced from [ Sarcana ]. Further, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income, which equates to underlying income before income taxes on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Tracey.\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nChief Financial Officer, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Greg, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We will be doing things a little bit differently this quarter. I will open and address our results, our guidance and importantly, our fourth quarter expectations at the start of the call, and then Gavin will close.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered another set of strong results. Our net sales revenue grew an impressive 11%, driven by double-digit growth in both our business units. Our continued focus on efficiencies and cost savings, combined with volume leverage, significantly offset inflationary pressures resulting in meaningful margin expansion. This led to 43.5% growth in underlying pretax income with both business units up strongly. And with free cash flow nearly doubling for the first 9 months of the year, we continue to prudently execute our capital deployment plan, investing in our business, reducing net debt and returning cash to shareholders. This performance underscores the strong momentum in our business, which is a function of the foundation we have built to sustainably grow both the top and bottom line. And this is exactly what we have done both in 2022 and year-to-date in 2023, all while navigating a challenging and dynamic global macroeconomic environment.\nAnd while these macro conditions remain, the fundamental strength of our business, coupled with the actions we are taking to sustain the momentum we have achieved gives us confidence for another year of growth in 2023 and beyond. For 2023, we are reaffirming our high single-digit top line growth guidance, but narrowing our expectations to the high end of that range. And we are raising our underlying pretax growth guidance to 32% to 36% as compared to 23% to 26% previously. We are also reducing our interest expense guidance to $210 million, plus or minus 5% as compared to $225 million plus or minus 5% previously. All other previous guidance metrics as detailed in today's earnings release remains unchanged. There are a few key reasons for these guidance changes. First, the U.S. beer category has been healthier than we had projected when we revised guidance on August 1. In other words, its rate of decline is better than we had expected and better than it was earlier this year.\nSecond, our brand volume growth is stronger than we had expected. In fact, we anticipate our global brand volume growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Third, pricing across our global markets and in particular, in Canada, has been better than we had planned. And fourth, due to higher-than-expected cash balances, we now anticipate lower net interest expense.\nOkay. With that in mind, let's discuss the fourth quarter. Our updated full year 2023 guidance implies mid-single-digit top line growth and at the midpoint, a high single-digit decline in underlying pretax income for the quarter. Now the fourth quarter growth rates do not imply a reversal in the trend for our brands in the U.S. In fact, our October brand volume performance is currently up pacing our trends in the third quarter, and we expect continued share growth roughly in line with what we saw in the third quarter. In short, we are not seeing anything that suggests that our market share gains are slowing.\nSo let's talk about some of the key factors driving fourth quarter performance. First, we will experience a reduced level of pricing benefit in the U.S. and EMEA and APAC. For example, we are lapping an approximate 5% general increase in the U.S. this fall. As anticipated and is supported by the strength of our brands, we took pricing in many of our U.S. markets in the 1% to 2% historical average range. Second, we expect our U.S. brand volume to outpace financial volume growth in the fourth quarter, and this is due to a couple of reasons. We ended the third quarter with healthy U.S. inventory levels. This was due to our strong brewery performance, which enabled us to ship ahead of expectations in the quarter. And this put us in a great position in the fourth quarter, providing the opportunity to give our employees some much deserved time off around the holidays. And it also allows us to execute planned downtime in the U.S. network for system maintenance.\nOverall, we expect to be well positioned to build inventory in the [ first ] quarter ahead of peak season. Also recall, we have a large U.S. contract brewing agreement winding down ahead of its termination at the end of 2024. We continue to expect volume declines under this contract to accelerate in the fourth quarter, resulting in a quarterly headwind of approximately 2% to 3% in Americas financial volume. Third, underlying COGS per hectoliter is expected to be a headwind in the fourth quarter. This was due to continued high inflation in EMEA and APAC and lower volume leverage than in the previous 2 quarters. And fourth, we expect total [ MG&A ] to be up approximately $90 million, which is driven by both marketing and G&A. For marketing, this includes approximately $50 million higher spend in the fourth quarter. And this increase is particularly impactful in a lower profit quarter like the fourth quarter. G&A is expected to be up primarily due to higher incentive compensation given our strong performance this year.\nOkay. So now let's talk about our third quarter performance. We delivered another quarter of strong results with net sales revenue growth supported by both rate and volume. Net sales per hectoliter grew 7.6%. This was driven by positive global net pricing, given the rollover benefits from the higher than typical increases taken in the fall of 2022 as well as favorable sales mix led by geographic mix. This geographic mix was due to particularly strong performance in the U.S. In fact, consolidated financial volume increased 3.2%, while U.S. shipments were up 7.2%. This is a result of our strong U.S. brewery performance, which enabled us to ship ahead of our expectations, but also it was due to the continued strong momentum behind our premium brands.\nConsolidated brand volume increased 1.1% with results varying by market. Americas brand volume was up 3.6%. Growth was led by the U.S., where brand volume was up 4.5%. In fact, Coors Light and Coors Banquet were each up double digits and Miller Lite was up high single digits. But there were some notable timing impact that mask the underlying strength in the U.S. brand volume growth. First, there was one [ less ] trading day in the quarter. On a trading day adjusted basis, U.S. brand volume growth was 6.1%. In addition, we were cycling significant loading ahead of the 2022 for price increases. And there was some shifting of calendar and holiday timing as compared to the prior year, which had an impact. Canada brand volume increased 0.2%, benefiting from growth in its above premium portfolio. While industry softness weighed on brand volume, we continue to grow share in Canada for the quarter, adding over 3 share points for the 3-month period ending August.\nIn Latin America, while mix improved, brand volume was down 2.5%. This was largely due to industry softness and economic conditions in some of our key markets in the region. And in EMEA and APAC, brand volume declined 5.2%. The consumers in Central and Eastern Europe continued to be affected by inflationary pressures and U.K. demand was impacted by rainy weather. That said, our [ bud ] premium portfolio continued to benefit from strong growth from [ Madri ], which grew brand volume over 50% in the quarter. This strong top line performance translated to even stronger bottom line results, and this was across both business units, with underlying pretax income up 32.2% in Americas and up 58.1% in EMEA and APAC. We achieved this by prudently managing costs while continuing to invest strongly behind our brands.\nSo let's talk about some of these drivers. Underlying COGS per hectoliter were up 2.6%. As expected, inflationary pressures continue to be a headwind, but moderated from the first half of the year. But the story differs by market. In the Americas, underlying COGS per hectoliter decreased 1% as cost savings, volume leverage and lower logistics costs more than offset the impact of direct material inflation. While in EMEA and APAC, inflationary pressures remained significant, driving underlying cost per hectoliter up 15.8%. To break down the drivers a bit more, as you may recall, we back up COGS into 3 areas. First is cost inflation, other, which includes cost inflation, depreciation, cost savings and other items. Second is mix and third is volume leverage or deleverage.\nThe cost inflation [indiscernible] of over 85% of the increase and was mostly due to higher materials and manufacturing costs partially offset by cost savings. The impact of volume leverage had an 80 basis point benefit in the COGS per hectoliter in the quarter. Other COGS per hectoliter drivers included mix, which accounted for the remainder of the increase and was largely due to geographic mix. Underlying marketing, general and administration expenses increased 11.6%. About half of the planned incremental $100 million in marketing spend in the second half of 2023 was in the third quarter, and it largely went to supporting the momentum of our core brands. Our investments focused on retaining our existing printers and attracting new ones, including using addressable channels or places where we can use data to more precisely target them. And further, we continue to strongly invest behind live sports. Based on our brand health and share performance, we believe that this investment is working. Also, general and administration expenses were higher. This was primarily due to incentive compensation expenses, which is a variable expense tied to our operating performance. And as you have seen, it's been a very strong year.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain to invest in our business to drive sustainable top and bottom line growth, reduced net debt as we remain committed maintaining and, in time, improving our investment-grade rating and return cash to shareholders. With our greatly improved financial flexibility, we now have increased optionality among these products, and we will utilize our models to determine the best anticipated return for our shareholders.\nLooking at these priorities. First, we continue to invest in the business with paid capital expenditures of $494 million for the first 9 months of the year. This was down slightly due to the timing of capital projects. Capital expenditures continue to focus on our gold and brewery modernization and expanding our capabilities to drive efficiencies, cost savings and sustainability initiatives. And second, we made further progress in reducing our net debt. We ended the quarter with net debt of [ $1.4 billion ], a decline of $584 million since December 31, 2022. This was supported by our July cash repayment of our $500 million Canadian debt upon its maturity on July 15. As a reminder, our outstanding debt is essentially all at fixed rates. Our exposure to floating rate debt is limited to our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, both of which had [ 0 ] balance outstanding at quarter end.\nGiven our strong EBITDA performance and lower net debt, our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio declined to 2.2x. This is in alignment with our long-term goal of under 2.5x. And I would like to add that in October, S&P Global upgraded [ credit risk ] rating Molson Coors to BBB from BBB-.\nAnd that brings me to our third priority, returning cash to shareholders. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share and maintain our intention to sustainably increase the dividend. And as announced at our Strategy Day on October our board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2 billion over the next 5 years. It replaces and supersedes the repurchase program previously approved by the Board in the first quarter of 2022. The new program is intended as a mixture of sustained and opportunistic purchases as part of our balanced and cohesive approach to prioritizing capital allocation intended to improve shareholder value creation. In summary, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter performance and confident in our ability to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth in the years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Tracey. In the third quarter, we continued the growth trajectory that we've been on for nearly 2 full years. In the quarter, each of our top 3 global markets are growing net sales revenue, volume, share or all 3. In the U.S., our shipments were up over 1 million hectoliters compared to the third quarter of 2022, and we were the top volume share gainer in the industry. Coors Light and Miller Lite are on track to collectively deliver net sales revenue growth for the third straight year, something that had not done since Miller and Coors came together in 2008. Coors Banquet volumes were up nearly 30%. Coors Light volumes were up double digits and Miller Lite volumes were up high single digits. We were the top dollar share gainer in the U.S. economy segment. In fact, our 2 biggest economy brands grew dollar and volume share of industry in the quarter. We have gained the second most U.S. share of flavored alcohol beverages of all major brewers.\nWe grew share nationally in Canada in every region of the country and in every segment of our industry. Coors Light widened its position as the #1 light beer in the country, a position it has held since March. And the Molson brands grew share. Miller Lite grew volumes by 50%, and we grew more share in flavor alcohol beverages than any other company in the industry. We were the best-performing brewer in the U.K. in both value and volume share, adding some very exciting news from the U.K. market, we are now the #2 brewer in London after ranking a [ distant ] #5 player only a few years ago. The transformation of our portfolio in the London market is a real testament to our team's commitment to a clear strategy that drives focus across all channels and customers. Additionally, [ Madri ] is now the second largest above premium lager in the on-premise and third largest world beer in the total trade across the U.K.\nAnd in Central and Eastern Europe, [ Osisko ], our core power brand in Croatia is growing value share of the beer category year-to-date, and it has over 50% value share of the core segment. Now of course, our business has benefited greatly from the broader dynamics of the U.S. beer industry over the past 7 months. But as you can see, the improvement in our business is being driven by more than one market. Improvement in our business is being driven by more than a couple of brands. The improvement in our business is being driven by more than one segment of the category and the improvement in our business predates April 1. Year-to-date, each of the top 3 biggest global markets are growing net sales revenue, volume and volume [indiscernible]\nAnd as this slide plainly shows the trajectory of our business has been on the upswing. And in regard to our future, we believe we can lap these results in 2024. We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022. We're on track to do so again this year. and we plan to do so next year, too. That's the plan we outlined at our Strategy Day last month. We've already gained thousands of [ tap handles ] across the U.S. since the beginning of the second quarter. We are already gaining significant amounts of shelf space this fall as retailers work to adjust their space to meet consumer trends. Now I have seen some, let's say, interesting commentary around shelf space. So I want to be extra clear here.\nThe vast majority of chain retail accounts typically update their shelf space once a year due to the complexity of lining all their stores. and they typically do so in the spring. Over 50 retailers have made space changes in late summer or fall due to the massive shift in consumer purchase behavior we have seen since April 1. This is not common. In fact, in the last 5-plus years, we haven't had any adjustments in the summer or a change to the premium segment in the fall. Among the chains that moved their resets up to the fall, Molson Coors was the biggest beneficiary with Miller Lite and Coors Light gaining 6% to 7% more shelf space. For brands of this size, that is a massive amount of space. In fact, it's tens of thousands of [indiscernible] space.\nRegardless of how some folks might characterize the current environment, those are effects. The conversations for spring resets are well underway. And while we can't exactly predict the future, it's safe to say that we expect to gain more shelf space for our big brands in those resets as well. These retailers are smart businesspeople. And when consumer trends shift to the degree they are shifting, chain retailers have 2 options: chain shelf space allocations to meet the trends or leave money on the table. And they're not going to leave money on the table. It's as simple as that. We'll have more to say about 2024 on our fourth quarter call in February. But between the work we have done to improve our business trajectory and the current dynamics in our industry, we feel confident in this year, confident in our ability to grow next year and confident inour ability to grow in the years ahead.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions."

You can find related slides on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website. Our speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Joubert. Chief Financial Officer.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A Commercial Finance and Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVice President of FP&A and Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone.

K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining today's call. Molson Coors has just finished the single best quarter of reported net sales revenue since the merger of Molson and Coors in 2005. That achievement is not only a measure of those 3 months, it's a measure of the past 3 years. It's about the work we've done to strengthen our business, which puts us in a position to attract consumers when they begin looking for alternatives. That's what allowed us to deliver these results today.\nNow to try and remove any skepticism that you may have, I want to show you 1 chart in our slides that summarizes exactly what I'm talking about. Up until 3 years ago, our biggest brand in our biggest market was losing dollar share quarter after quarter and year after year. Shortly after we launched our revitalization plan, we changed our marketing approach on Coors Light and launched the [ Major Chill ] campaign, and the brand's results began to improve. In the first quarter of this year, Coors Light revenue was up high single digits. In the second quarter, Coors Light grew more industry dollar share than any other beer brand and it grew industry dollar share faster than [ Modelo Especial ] and [ Corona Extra ] combined.\nThe overlay Miller Lite's performance, it's remarkably similar. And the reason for that is simple. 3 years ago, we generated cost savings and have been reinvesting them back into our brands and back into our business. 3 years ago, we completely changed our approach to marketing and media, which unlocked growth for our biggest brands. Over the past 3 years, we have improved our supply chain. We've diversified our network of material supplies in our shipping methods. We've adjusted our brewery and packaging operations. We've streamlined our ordering systems for customers, and we've invested in our facilities. Collectively, we believe this has made us much more nimble and much more prepared to meet elevated demand. Over the past 3 years, our strategy has made our brands demonstrably stronger in 2023 than they were in 2019. So while we didn't plan our largest competitor's largest brand planting volume by nearly 30% during the quarter. If this had happened in 2019, we would surely not have seen the sales benefit that we did in 2023 or even been able to meet the demand.\nNow a lot has been said about the U.S. beer industry over the past few months. But I thought it would be helpful to provide a deeper level of detail than what you've seen in channel data and give more insights about what we believe the current trends mean for the future. First, Molson Coors is #1 in retail display dollar gains year-to-date. This is the easiest way for retailers to adjust space on short notice. So we see it as a strong early indicator of shelter sentiment. And it's also worth remembering that our largest brands had already experienced a display lift in the first quarter due to our suitable retail execution. We also know a number of retailers have moved their shelf reset timing from the spring to the fall, which we expect will make some portion of the current trend structural.\nFor the retailers who stayed with spring resets, those conversations are well underway. Currently, nearly 20 of our top retailers are updating their planograms to drive more space for our brands and keep them in stock based on the latest demand. Continuing with retail, we are seeing particularly strong growth in the convenience channel with both volume sales and dollar sales up double digits in the quarter.\nIn the United States, Convenience is the #1 channel where we have historically under indexed. So to capitalize on this momentum, we are planning to increase our investment behind C-store shopper marketing in the second half of the year. In the on-premise, Molson Coors gained over 12,000 new tap handles in the second quarter alone, and we grew sales at double the rate of the category on leading e-commerce platforms. We're proud of this execution, and we're equally proud of the work our supply chain team has done over the past several years to really ask for this quarter. When in May and June, our U.S. breweries had their highest levels of production since 2019.\nAnd lastly, it's important to note that the competitive pricing moves around Memorial Day and the fourth of July did not appear to have a negative impact on our brands as our share gains continued. Given the relative size, Coors Light and Miller Lite in the United States naturally had an outsized impact on our second quarter results. To put the growth of these brands into perspective, Coors Light and Miller Lite combined we're 50% bigger than Bud Light by total industry dollars and 30% bigger than Modelo Especial in the second quarter. And to put that further in perspective, in the second quarter of last year, Bud Light was bigger than Coors Light and Miller Lite combined. But the momentum we're seeing isn't confined to a specific brand, segment, channel or geography.\nGlobally, we grew the top line by double digits and the bottom line by more than 50% in the second quarter. We grew volume and share in the United States. We grew volume and share in Canada. We grew volume and share in the United Kingdom and our top 3 brands globally. Coors Light, Miller Lite and Miller High Lite are all growing volume globally. In the U.S., the top dollar share gainer nationally with Coors Light, Simply Spiked and Miller Lite representing 3 of the top 5 franchises in the quarter. Every single one of our top 5 U.S. brands grew dollar share in the quarter as well.\nCoors banquet gained share of the U.S. beer industry for the eighth consecutive quarter, an impressive feat for a 150-year-old brand of its size. Our economy brands grew dollar share of industry, including volume growth for High Life and Keystone. We also gained the second most dollar and volume share in total flavor in the second quarter. We now have the #3 and #5 Hard seltzers brands in the United States, and Simply [ Peats ] was the best-performing new product in the quarter by dollar share.\nIn energy drinks, ZOA is continuing its upward trajectory. Since the end of the first quarter, more than 11,000 additional retail outlets that placed the brand's new 12-ounce cans, we believe ZOA has a bright future. And just last month, announced a new marketing campaign, featuring some of the country's most prominent college athletes as brand ambassadors. All of the points I just shared led to our best quarterly U.S. brand volume trends since the Miller Coors joint venture in 2008. It led to revenue growth in every channel, in every segment and in every region.\nAnd in Canada, the story is similar. We saw double-digit brand volume growth in the quarter, led by Coors Light and the Molson brand franchise, which also grew share of the industry. These trends were actually well on their way even before the start of the second quarter. At the end of March, Coors Light became the #1 light beer and #2 overall beer in the country, surpassing Bud Light. While the Hard Seltzer segment in Canada was down in the second quarter, Molson Coors was the only large brewer to hold share of the segment.\nIn EMEA and APAC, I'll start with our performance in the U.K., where we grew volume, share and revenue, and our on-premise share performance hit its highest levels in over a decade. Madri delivered triple-digit volume growth and is now the fourth largest above premium brand in our global portfolio. Based on track data in the U.K., Madri is now a top 5 brand for on-premise value sales. What this brand has achieved in 3 years is incredible. Back by Madri incurs more than half of our total EMEA and APAC revenue as of the second quarter was generated by brand volumes from the above premium segment. And [ Osisko ], our second largest brand in the region surpassed the 50% share of segment in the Croatian market and is benefiting from new enhancements we've made to our can lines in the region.\nSo we had an incredible second quarter, the best in years by many accounts. And while our 2 biggest brands in our biggest market played a large role, you can see that our entire business contributed meaningfully. We're proving this business can grow the top and bottom line sustainably. We're proving we have the resilience and wherewithal to navigate macro challenges affecting our industry and the world. And we believe we're proving that when we stick to a clear strategy over the long term, results will continue to follow. That's what we've done for the past 3 years. That's why we are where we are today. It's what we expect will drive sustainable growth for our business moving forward, and it's why we're confident in raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.\nNow before I pass it over to Tracey for more detail, I wanted to share that on October 3, we will be hosting a Strategy Day in New York City. More details are to come but we look forward to providing a longer-term view of our strategy and outlook at that time. Tracey?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nChief Financial Officer, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, on a constant currency basis, we delivered tremendous results. Net sales revenue grew 12.1% and underlying pretax income grew 52.6%. We achieved this while continuing to invest in our business, reduce net debt and return cash to shareholders. As Gavin discussed, we have built our business to sustainably grow both the top and bottom line. We achieved this in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023 before this recent period of accelerated demand in the U.S. And while we remain mindful of the dynamic global macroeconomic environment and recent beer industry softness, the foundation we have laid coupled with our strong second quarter performance provide us confidence to increase our full year 2023 guidance, meaningfully accelerating growth from our prior expectations.\nNow before we get to that, let's talk about some of the drivers of the second quarter performance. Net sales per hectoliter grew 9% in the quarter. This was driven by positive global net pricing due to rollover pricing benefits from higher than typical increases taken in 2022 and favorable sales mix driven by geographic mix and premiumization. Financial volume increased 2.8% and consolidated brand volume increased 5%. The volume growth was driven by strength in our Americas business, partially offset by a decline in our EMEA and APAC business.\nTurning to costs. Underlying cost per hectoliter were up 5.9%. As expected, inflationary pressures continue to be a headwind. As you may recall, we bucket COGS into 3 areas. First is cost inflation other which includes cost inflation, depreciation, cost savings and other items; second is mix; and third is volume leverage or deleverage. The cost inflation bucket drove 80% of the increase and was mostly due to higher materials and manufacturing costs, partially offset by cost savings. Volume leverage had a meaningfully positive impact on COGS per hectoliter in the quarter providing a 100 basis point benefit. Other COGS per hectoliter drivers included mix, which accounted for the remainder of the increase. This was largely due to the impact of non-owned brands as well as premiumization. And while premiumization is a negative for COGS, it is a positive for gross margin per hectoliter.\nUnderlying marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 4.1%. The increase was driven by higher incentive compensation expense, which is a variable expense tied to our operating performance, as well as higher marketing investments. Now let's look at our quarter results by business units.\nIn the Americas, net sales revenue grew 11.5% and underlying pretax income grew 40%. Americas net sales per hectoliter increased 6.2%, benefiting from positive net pricing across the region as well as favorable sales mix. The strong net pricing growth included benefits from higher than typical U.S. and Canada pricing in 2022. As a reminder, in the U.S. in 2022, we took 2 part increases. A spring and fall, each averaging approximately 5%. We lapped last year's spring increase in the third quarter and will begin to lap last year's full increase this September.\nFinancial volume increased 5%. This was due to a 4.8% increase in U.S. domestic shipments, driven by higher brand volumes due to a shift in consumer purchasing behavior largely within the premium segment in the quarter. In addition, Canada shipments increased in part due to cycling the impact of the [indiscernible] labor strike in the second quarter last year. This was partially offset by lower Latin American and contract brewing volumes. Americas brand volumes were up 8%. U.S. brand volume increased 8.7% largely due to growth in our core brands with Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet all up double digits. Growth was also driven by strength in our Above Premium portfolio led by flavor.\nIn Canada, brand volume increased 11.3%. While [ sparkling ] the Quebec labor strike was a driver, we also achieved growth in each of our Canadian regions. In Latin America, brand volume was down 5.9%, largely due to industry softness in some of our major markets in that region. On the cost side, Americas underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 2.5%. Inflation remained the leading driver of the increase but the impact was partially offset by benefits of volume leverage and lower logistics costs. MG&A was up on higher incentive compensation and higher marketing investments, particularly for key innovations like Simply Spike.\nTurning to EMEA and APAC. Net sales revenue increased 14.7%, and underlying pretax income increased 82.7%. Net sales per hectoliter grew 18.3%. This was driven by positive net pricing largely related to the rollover benefits from increases taken in 2022, favorable sales mix and continued premiumization in the U.K., fueled by the strength of brands like Madri and positive geographic mix. Financial volume declined 3%, relatively in line with brand volume, which was down 2.9%. Looking by market, financial volume grew in the U.K. on strong brand volume due to the resilience of the U.K. consumer and our strong on-premise performance as well as higher factor brand sales. But this was more than offset by the counts in Central and Eastern Europe due to industry softness, including the impact of the continued inflationary pressures on the consumer.\nOn the cost side, underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 17.7%. This was largely due to inflation-related brewing and packaging materials and logistics costs as well as the mix impact of premiumization and high affected brands. SG&A was relatively flat. Underlying free cash flow was $570 million for the first 6 months of the year, and this was an improvement of $282 million, primarily due to higher net income and lower cash capital expenditures.\nTurning to capital allocation. Capital expenditures paid were $335 million for the first 6 months of the year. This was down $54 million and was due to the timing of capital projects. Capital expenditures continue to focus on our gold and brewery modernization and expanding our capabilities in areas that we believe drive efficiencies and savings. We reduced our net debt by $308 million since December 31, 2022, ending the second quarter with net debt of $5.7 billion. And in July, we repaid our CAD 500 million debt in cash upon its maturity on July 15. As a reminder, our outstanding debt is essentially all at fixed rates. Our exposure to floating rate debt is limited to our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, both of which had a 0 balance outstanding at quarter end. And we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share and maintain our intention to sustainably increase the dividend.\nGiven our strong EBITDA performance and lower net debt, our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio as of quarter end reached our longer-term leverage ratio target of 2.5x. Our capital allocation priorities remain to invest in our business, reduce net debt as we remain committed to maintaining and in time, improving our investment grade rating and return cash to shareholders. But our greatly improved financial flexibility does provide us increased optionality among these priorities and we will utilize our models to determine the best anticipated return for our shareholders.\nNow let's discuss our outlook. But first, please recall that we cite year-over-year growth rates in constant currency. We are raising our 2023 key financial guidance to reflect the continued strength we are seeing in our core brands in the U.S. while remaining mindful of the softness in the beer industry and continued caution around the consumer. We now expect high single-digit net sales revenue growth as compared to low single-digit growth previously. We now expect 23% to 26% underlying pretax income growth as compared to low single-digit growth previously. And we also now expect underlying free cash flow of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10% as compared to 1 billion plus or minus 10% previously.\nNow let me break down some of the guidance assumptions. From a top line perspective, given the strong demand in the U.S., we now expect growth to be driven not only by rate but also by volume. But we continue to expect a headwind related to the large U.S. contract brewing agreement that has begun to wind down ahead of its termination at the end of 2024. As discussed on our first quarter call, we expect volume declines under this contract to accelerate in the fourth quarter. For context, the headwind impact of this is expected to be approximately 2% to 3% of America's financial volume in the fourth quarter. We continue to view the termination of this contract as a positive because while a headwind from a volume perspective, we believe it is positive for us in terms of freeing up capacity and enhancing margins.\nAs for distributor inventories before that we had both higher U.S. distributor inventory levels at the end of the first quarter this year versus the prior year. However, given the strong demand, distributor inventory levels in the U.S. declined following both the Memorial Day and fourth of July holidays. We expect they will further decline following the Labor Day holiday. Recall that declines in distributor inventory held through the summer and particularly post our holidays during this period are typical. Also, as usual, we anticipate rebuilding inventory in the shoulder quarters being the first and fourth quarters. So while supply is currently tight, our brewery operations have done an excellent job of meeting the demand.\nAs for pricing, given the strength of our brands, we continue to anticipate taking a general increase in the U.S. this fall. At this point, we expect our pricing increase to be in line with industry average historical annual levels of 1% to 2%. In terms of costs, we continue to expect the impact of inflation on COGS to be a headwind for the year, but we expect it to moderate in the second half. While stock rates for a number of commodities have declined, we, like most CPG companies have a hedging program, which we expect will largely smooth out the impact of swings in commodity pricing. Further, our business in EMEA and APAC is expected to continue to experience relatively high inflationary pressure.\nIn addition, we expect favorable volume leverage to partially offset cost increases. This, combined with continued premiumization and lower contract brewing volumes are expected to drive gross margin expansion for the year. Underlying MG&A expenses is expected to be approximately $100 million higher in the second half as compared to the first half of this year and up approximately 15% versus the second half of 2022. This is primarily due to higher marketing spend which is expected to be up approximately $100 million as well as higher people-related costs as compared to the same period last year.\nAs for our secondary guidance metrics, we continue to expect capital expenditures incurred of $700 million, plus or minus 5%. Underlying depreciation and amortization of $690 million, plus or minus 5% and an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%. However, we are reducing our net interest expense guidance of $225 to $225 million plus or minus 5% as compared to 240 million plus or minus 5% previously. This decrease is driven by the July payoff of the Canadian debt maturity, higher interest income due to higher cash levels and higher interest rates on deposits and lower short-term borrowings than previously anticipated.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance. While we could not have foreseen the shifts that we have seen in consumer behavior that began in the second quarter, our strategy has positioned us well. With a strong portfolio of brands across all price segments and the financial flexibility that enables us to continue to invest prudently in our business, we are confident in our ability to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth not only in full year 2023, but also beyond. We look forward to sharing more details on our strategic initiatives, capital allocation and longer-term outlook at our upcoming Strategy Day on October 3.\nWith that, we look forward to answering your questions.

You can find related slides on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website. Our speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll hand it over to Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A Commercial Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVice President of FP&A and Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with our IR team in the days and weeks that follow. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC.\nWe assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. GAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year period.\nAlso, U.S. share data references are sourced from Sircana, formerly called IRI. And further, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income, which equates to underlying income before income taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. With that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us this morning. When we reported our 2022 results our ability to grow the top and bottom line was neither an anomaly nor an accident. It's the result of sticking relentlessly to a clear strategy. I also said our North Star is to deliver sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth. And while we remain cautious about the consumer outlook over the course of 2023, so far this year, we have continued to deliver.\nIn the first quarter, we grew the top line by high single digits, and we nearly doubled our bottom line. These are clearly strong results following a strong 2022 as well. But I would caution you not to simply apply this growth rate to the entirety of 2023. Certainly, the fundamental strength of our business was a driver in our performance, but we also benefited from the lapping of Omicron-related restrictions in some of our markets and particularly strong pricing in all of our major markets compared to the prior year period.\nThese drivers were expected. As a result, we are maintaining our full year guidance, and Tracey will go into more detail on that shortly. Importantly, the fundamentals of our business are strong. We're growing revenue in both business units and across our iconic brands. And our above premium innovation across the Americas and EMEA & APAC is truly changing the shape of our portfolio. So we see reasons for continued caution in the broader consumer landscape.\nAs you are all aware, the consumer packaged good industry remains impacted by rising interest rates and global inflation, both of which persisted into the first quarter. And while we are still not experiencing meaningful trade down in our U.S. business, we have seen consumers shifting away from midsized packs towards singles and larger packs. In February, I mentioned we have seen a price-sensitive subset of consumers shifting to smaller pack sizes, in particular to single serves. Those trends remained in the first quarter, but we are also seeing a shift into larger packs among consumers with higher household income levels.\nThis, combined with channel shifting behavior among these same consumers, suggest an increased focus on finding the best value even if it requires shopping at multiple stores. Trends notwithstanding, our brands proved incredibly resilient this quarter, starting with our premium light brands in the United States. Collectively in the U.S., Coors Light and Miller Lite grew revenue by double digits in the quarter and held total industry dollar share, and Miller Lite was a top 10 growth brand in the quarter.\nThese brands benefited immensely from our first Super Bowl campaign in more than 30 years. During the run-up to the Super Bowl in February, Miller Lite and Coors Light, both saw a positive volume trend change versus the prior 13 weeks. Coors Light grew displays leading up to the Super Bowl and was a top 3 brand for all display activity in February due to the strength of our plans and execution.\nOutside the U.S., our iconic brands in Canada and in Europe remained strong as well. In Canada, Molson Canadian grew brand volume and is growing share again in 2023 after returning to share growth in 2022. Coors Light also grew brand volume in Canada. In the U.K., Carling remains the #1 beer by volume across the industry, with distribution and velocity significantly ahead of competition in the core segment.\nMore broadly, we grew total financial volume in EMEA & APAC in the first quarter, and our Above Premium portfolio in the U.K. has been a major growth driver. Madri Excepcional continued to grow share during the first quarter. Madri is now larger than Budweiser in the U.K., and recently had moved ahead of on-trade, where it is now the #6 beer. We continue to see tremendous potential for this brand as we head into the summer months.\nIn the U.S., Peroni grew brand volume in the quarter. And in February, we introduced Peroni 0.0 in select U.S. regions with a new marketing campaign and a global partnership with the Aston Martin Formula One team. Just as our portfolio performed strongly in the first quarter across Above Premium Beer, the same is true for our brands across Above Premium flavor and Beyond Beer.\nWe have previously referenced these as distinct spaces in our portfolio. But given the recent evolution in our Americas operating structure and to better align with broader industry definitions, we will now speak to Beyond Beer inclusive of all nonbeer brands, meaning FABs, hard seltzers products and non-alcohol.\nStarting with FABs in the U.S. Simply Spiked is now a top 10 brand in this segment. It was also a top 5 industry growth brand in the quarter. And just last month, we introduced Simply Spiked Peach. On its own, Simply Spiked Lemonade ended 2022 as the #2 new item in the total category. We brought Simply Spiked to Canada in the first quarter, and there is significant runway as we continue to innovate under this brand.\nAnd also in Canada, we are the only large brewer growing share in Hard Seltzer. In the U.S., despite cycling last year's national launch, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer grew brand volume in March. In ready-to-drink cocktails, we've just released Topo Chico Spirited across more than 20 U.S. markets. And recently, we announced our plans to continue building our presence in Beyond Beer with the launch of select markets later this year, another new branch of our successful relationship with the Coca-Cola Company.\nAs we continue to premiumize our portfolio, we remain focused on growing ZOA as well. After doubling its volume in 2022, we are excited about the opportunity for ZOA in 2023 with our new and vibrant packaging. And finally, in full strength bottled spirits, we are continuing to expand into whiskey with Five Trail and our new Barmen 1873 Bourbon. Those brands will be in a total of 25 markets this year. And just last week, Five Trail was awarded 2 gold medals at the Denver International Spirits Competition.\nOur progress in Beyond Beer is just one marker of our commitment to total beverage, and it's also a reflection of our successful approach to innovation. But none of this would be possible without continued investments in our capabilities. We've made progress here. And just this month, our new flavor packing capabilities will be going online at our Fort Worth brewery. These enhancements involve a $65 million investment in the facility where we now produce the majority of our flavor innovation brands in-house.\nJust as we're modernizing our production capabilities, we've modernized our structure as well. In February, we established a new commercial structure in the Americas and elevated Michelle St. Jacques to Chief Commercial Officer. This new structure is designed to unlock the next phase of growth across our brands, geographies and capabilities.\nFirst, our U.S. sales and marketing teams will now be working even more closely together with one set of guiding commercial principles. We will also place more emphasis on key growth areas like innovation, beyond beer and digital capabilities. And finally, all of these changes will enable us to make even faster decisions and better ensure our investments match our ambitions across the full commercial landscape.\nSo from the changes we are making within our own team to the progress we are seeing across our global portfolio, the trajectory of our business is becoming clear. No matter how uncertain the environment around us might be. And the message I want to leave you with today is of consistency and stability. The results we saw in the first quarter underscore the strong foundation we have built to continue to drive consistent top and bottom line growth and achieving our eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth proves this out.\nThe emphasis we put in our core brands across global markets shows they can stabilize and grow consistently. The strength of our innovation shows we can premiumize our portfolio consistently. And even in parts of our business that are completely new, we are showing consistent progress and an ability to reach new consumers. There's power and consistency.\nAnd in our case, there's power in a portfolio that is strategically built to offer consumers a range of winning brands across price tiers and preferences. Now to give you more detail on the financials and outlook, I'll hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Joubert. Tracey?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nChief Financial Officer, Molson Coors Brewing Co.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, on a constant currency basis, we grew net sales revenue 8.2% and underlying pretax income 82.8%, while continuing to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. While we remain mindful of the dynamic global macroeconomic environment and beer industry softness, our first quarter performance, coupled with the strong foundation we have laid over the last 3 years, provide us confidence to reaffirm our 2023 full year guidance.\nThis guidance would mark another year of growth on a constant currency basis delivering on our goal of sustainable top and bottom line growth. Now let's talk about some of the drivers of the first quarter performance. Strong global net pricing due to rollover pricing benefits from higher than typical increases taken in 2022 and positive sales mix from premiumization and favorable geographic mix across both business units led to 8.4% net sales per hectoliter growth.\nFinancial volume declined 0.2% as lower Americas volumes was partially offset by higher volume in EMEA & APAC. Consolidated brand volume declined 2.1%. Turning to costs. As expected, inflationary pressures continued to be a headwind in the quarter, driving underlying COGS per hectoliter up 7.4%. And as you can see from the slides, we back at COGS into 3 areas. First is cost inflation and other which includes cost inflation, depreciation, cost savings and other items; second is mix; and third is deleverage.\nThe cost inflation bucket drove almost 80% of the increase and was mostly due to higher material, conversion and energy costs. Cost savings and our hedging program helped to mitigate some of these cost pressures. Other costs per hectoliter drivers included mix, which was about 20% of the increase. This is largely due to the impact of factored brands in the U.K. as well as premiumization. And while premiumization is a negative for COGS, it's a positive for gross margin per hectoliter. Deleverage had a negligible impact on COGS per hectoliter in the quarter.\nNow let's look at our quarterly results by business unit. In the Americas, net sales revenue was up 6.5% and underlying pretax income grew 37.7%. Americas net sales per hectoliter increased 7.1%, largely benefiting from strong net pricing growth as well as favorable brand and geographic mix. The strong net pricing growth included benefits from higher than typical U.S. and Canada pricing in 2022. As a reminder, in the U.S., in 2022, we took 2 pricing increases, a spring and fall, each averaging approximately 5%.\nThe spring increase was taken in January and the beginning of February, which was earlier in the first quarter than usual, and the full increase began in September 2022. Financial volume declined 0.5%, and this was due to industry softness as well as lower Latin American and contract brewing volumes. This was partially offset by a 1% increase in U.S. domestic shipments to bring our distributor inventory levels, primarily for our core brands, to a stronger position compared to a year ago. Brand volumes were down 1.5%.\nLooking at brand volume by region. The U.S. declined 1.2% on software industry performance and lower economy volume. There was also 1 more trading day in the quarter. So on a trading day adjusted basis, U.S. brand volume was down 2.8%. In Canada, brand volume increased 4.9%, driven by growth in core brands and lapping Omicron on-premise restrictions in the prior year period. In Latin America, brand volume was down 12.4%, largely due to industry softness in some of our major markets in the region.\nOn the cost side, Americas underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.6%, while MG&A was flat.\nTurning to EMEA & APAC. Net sales revenue increased 16.1%, and underlying pretax income increased 27.6%. Positive net pricing included the rollover benefits from increases taken in 2022, favorable sales mix on continued premiumization fueled by the strength of brands like Madri and positive geographic mix drove net sales per hectoliter growth of 15.1%. Financial volume grew 0.8% on the strength of our both premium portfolio and higher factor brand volume. Brand volume declined 3.9%.\nLooking by market, brand volume grew in the U.K., but this was more than offset by declines in our export and license business in markets impacted by the Russian war in Ukraine, which we exited in March 2022 as well as by declines in Central and Eastern Europe due to the impact of inflationary pressures on the consumer.\nOn the cost side, underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 15.2%. This was largely due to cost inflation related to materials transportation and energy as well as mix from premiumization and the impact of brands. Underlying free cash flow was a negative $174 million for the quarter, and this was an improvement of $185 million, primarily due to higher net income and lower cash capital expenditures.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reduce net debt and return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures paid were $181 million for the quarter. This was down $62 million and was due to the timing of capital projects. Capital expenditures continue to focus on our Golden Brewery modernization and expanding our capabilities in areas that drive efficiencies and savings like a variety pack that Gavin mentioned earlier.\nWe ended the quarter with net debt of $6.3 billion, which is essentially all at fixed rate. Our exposure to floating rate debt is limited to our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, which had 0 balances outstanding at quarter end. Our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio was just under 3x, and we remain committed to maintaining and in time, improving our investment-grade rating and strive towards a longer-term leverage ratio target of approximately 2.5x.\nAnd we returned cash to our shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share. The dividend represents an increase of 8% from the fourth quarter 2022 level. It is our second increase since we reinstated the dividend in 2021, and it aligns with our intention to sustainably increase the dividend.\nNow let's discuss our outlook. But first, please recall that we cite year-over-year growth rates in constant currency. And when considering the first quarter in relation to our full year, remember, the first quarter is our smallest quarter. So percentage changes in the first quarter are off much smaller basis.\nOn to our guidance. We are reaffirming our 2023 guidance, which includes low single-digit growth for both net sales revenue and underlying pretax income and underlying free cash flow of $1 billion, plus or minus 10%. This guidance anticipates full year growth, despite softness in the beer industry, caution around the consumer and impacts of continued global inflationary cost pressures.\nAs we discussed on our fourth quarter call, our underlying assumptions assume that top line growth is more rate than volume driven as we continue to benefit from the strong global net pricing that we took in 2022 as well as benefits from portfolio premiumization. Keep in mind that due to the timing of our 2022 U.S. pricing increases, we had a disproportionate benefit in the first quarter of this year. And while it's early years, we don't anticipate taking another potential general increase in the U.S. until the fall of this year, at which point it is possible we could see pricing return to its more historical levels of 1% to 2%.\nIn terms of financial volume, recall that we have a headwind as a large contract billing agreement begins to wind down ahead of its termination at the end of 2024. We expect significant volume declines under this contract in the second half of the year with acceleration in the fourth quarter.\nAnd as I previously mentioned, we built stronger U.S. distributor inventory levels at the end of the first quarter versus the prior year, with U.S. shipment trends roughly 4 percentage points ahead of trading day adjusted brand volume. We expect this inventory build will unwind in the subsequent quarter as we maintain our goal to ship to consumption for the year.\nIn terms of costs, we expect the impact of inflation on COGS to remain elevated in the second quarter before moderating in the second half of the year, and we continue to expect it will be a headwind for the year. However, utilizing our levers, which include pricing, ongoing cost savings efforts, our hedging program and continued premiumization, we expect gross margin dollars per hectoliter to increase for the full year in both business units.\nWe also expect to continue to strongly support our core brands and key innovations, particularly in the key beer selling season. As a result, we plan to increase marketing dollar investments in 2023 versus the prior year.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and our ability to manage the dynamic macro environment with a strong portfolio of brands across all price segments and the financial flexibility that enables us to continue to invest prudently in our business, we are confident in our ability to sustainably deliver growth in full year 2023 and beyond. With that, we look forward to answering your questions. Operator?"

You can find related slides on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website. Our speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will hand it over to Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVP of FP&A and IR, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Following the prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with our IR team in the days and weeks that follow.\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. GAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period, in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year period.\nAlso, in order to better align with GAAP reported metrics in our filings and simplify our reporting, references to net sales per hectoliter will now be on a financial volume basis instead of on a brand volume basis. Further, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income which equates to underlying income before income taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWith that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm very pleased to tell you that 3 years after relaunching -- after launching our revitalization plan to turn around this business and 3 years of after pledging to deliver top- and bottom-line growth, we have done exactly that. We grew the top line by 7%, we grew the bottom line by almost 8%. We brought our leverage ratio under 3x. We stuck to our strategy and our plans, and we delivered, despite the fact that many people didn't think we could. To be sure, there have been a lot of ups and downs in the past 3 years, but through it all, achieving consistent top and bottom line growth has been our North Star, and we are well on the road to doing just that.\nI have many questions our ability to execute this plan. So I want to take a couple of minutes to break down how we arrived at this moment. First, we streamlined our business in 2019 and early 2020 to drive significant savings. Second, we built on the strength of our core brands for the past 3-plus years. The results, Coors Light and Miller Lite revenues are both well above 2019 levels in the United States.\nCollectively, Coors Light and Miller Lite grew both U.S. volume and dollar share in the fourth quarter. They even combined to outperform the combination of Michelob Ultra and Bud Light in U.S. volume share performance for the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter, Coors Light and Miller Lite's combined volume share exceeded Bud Light in tracked channels.\nAnd in Canada, we're also seeing strength as Molson Canadian grew revenue and industry share in 2022. In the U.K., Carling continues to be the #1 brand in the market. These trends didn't just suddenly appear. They are the result of consistent brand messaging and more effective brand investment.\nThirdly, we have aggressively premiumized our portfolio. Today, over 28% of our global net sales revenue now comes from our above premium portfolio, up from 23% in 2019. Our U.S. above premium portfolio gained the second-most dollar share of all major U.S. brewers in 2022. And while our Seltzer portfolio, of course, was a contributor, our progress is driven by more than just Seltzer.\nPeroni's 2022 revenues were up double digits in the U.S. compared to 2019 levels, even though the brand skews heavily to the on-premise. Blue Moon's 2022 U.S. revenues were also higher compared to 2019, aided by the successful launch of Blue Moon LightSky. Simply Spiked, which we introduced last summer quickly became the fastest growing new innovation in the U.S. FAB category.\nIn Canada our Craft division grew brand volume double digits in 2022, and we have the only hard seltzer portfolio gaining industry share in that market. But the standout star of our global portfolio continues to be Madri Excepcional in the U.K. I really want you to understand the tremendous growth of this brand and its size today. In less than 2 years, it has become one of our top 5 above premium brands globally.\nFourthly, we expanded beyond beer, where we have laid solid foundations in energy drinks and full strength spirits, which are totally new spaces for us. ZOA continued to grow very strongly, brand volumes were up triple digits in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with trend acceleration in the quarter.\nOur first full strength spirit Five Trail is enjoying expanded distribution to more states and select international markets. And building on the continued success of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, we are expanding our partnership with the Coca-Cola Company to release Topo Chico spirited this spring to compete in the fast-growing ready-to-drink cocktail space.\nAnd finally, we have invested in our future. We've added brewery capabilities throughout our network, completing the build of 2 new state-of-the-art modern breweries in Canada, adding Hard Seltzer and slim can production capabilities and building a new variety packing facility in Texas. And we're in the midst of a large-scale modernization of our Golden Colorado brewery, which supports improved efficiencies and helps us deliver our sustainability goals. This work shows our 2022 results aren't an aberration or a moment in time.\nOur top and bottom line growth is the product of 3 years of hard work under our revitalization plan. We are proving this company can grow profitably, and we intend to continue demonstrating that in the years ahead. Of course, we expect various ups and downs over the next few years. And just like many other consumer good companies that have reported this year, we see reasons for caution about the consumer landscape in the immediate term, not just for beer, but for consumer goods more broadly.\nBeer has traditionally been very resilient during tough economic times. Yet it is true that U.S. industry-wide beer volumes fell at a much higher rate in the fourth quarter than they had earlier in the year. Much of this has been attributed to most of the beer industry taking a second price increase in the calendar year. And yet beer as a category has maintained its share of basket at retail. So consumers are not reducing beer purchasing in favor of other staples.\nAdditionally, Beer actually gained share of total alcohol beverage in the quarter. So consumers are not switching to other alcohol beverages. And in fact, notwithstanding the comments made by a large upstream supplier, we see the pricing taken in 2022 still sticking across our markets earlier this year.\nSo pricing with the driving reason behind the softer industry trends, we would have expected it to adversely impact the beer industry relative to other consumer staples or other alcohol beverage categories. And we haven't seen that. But what we have seen is a subset of value-conscious U.S. consumers who are actively trading down into smaller pack sizes. We have also seen the economy segment continue to strengthen.\nThe uncertainty of these broad consumer trends that all companies are facing in 2023 are a driving factor in our more modest guidance for this upcoming year, despite our relatively more optimistic outlook for the medium term where we anticipate delivering higher top and bottom line growth rates than we expect in 2023. At the same time, we expect to see margin improvement over the medium term. This is supported by our goal for our above premium portfolio to reach approximately 1/3 of our global net sales revenue over the medium term.\nSo even in this challenging and uncertain economic climate, we expect to deliver against the north star of our revitalization plan by achieving top- and bottom-line growth at Molson Coors with margin improvement on a consistent long-term basis.\nOur portfolio is strategically built for strength across the range of pricing tiers within the beer industry. That gives us greater stability than some of our competitors in any economic climate. But some of that is a reflection of the simple fact that Molson Coors' revenue and profit trajectories are stronger than they have been in years, and our business is healthier today. We are a much leaner business than we were in 2019. We have powerful core brands across our global markets that are seeing renewed strength. We are premiumizing our portfolio with strong innovations around the world. We are diversifying our offerings to consumers. We're building the capabilities today that will power this business tomorrow. We're investing in our people. And for the first time in a while, we are delivering real results.\nThanks to the work of thousands of people around the world, that's the story of Molson Coors today, and that's what you should all expect from us consistently over the long term as well. Now to give you more detail on the financials and outlook, I'll hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Joubert. Tracey?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. In 2022, on a constant currency basis, we grew net sales revenue 7%, exceeding our guidance and underlying pretax income 7.6%, delivering our guidance. This performance resulted in record underlying pretax income levels for a fourth quarter, which many questions we could achieve. But we delivered with underlying pretax income up 51.1%. We did this despite the challenging global macroeconomic environment and a softer beer industry all while continuing to invest in our business and enhancing our financial flexibility and returning cash to shareholders.\nNow before I take you through our results and outlook, as a reminder, we discussed our business performance on a constant currency basis. However, currency impact from the strong U.S. dollar did have a meaningful impact on our top line and resulted in a net sales revenue headwind to reported results of $89 million in the fourth quarter and $298 million for the year.\nNow let's talk about some of the drivers of the fourth quarter performance. Our ability to take strong global net pricing and deliver positive sales mix across both business units led to 11.4% net sales per hectoliter growth. Financial volumes declined 6.9%, the biggest drivers were lower brand volumes in the Americas given the industry softness as well as cycling a significant prior year distributor inventory build in the U.S. Conversely, EMEA and APAC financial volumes increased, resulting from a fairly resilient consumer in the U.K. and cycling Omicron-related restrictions in the prior year period.\nTurning to costs. As expected, inflationary pressures continue to be a headwind in the quarter, driving underlying COGS per hectoliter up 11.5%. As you can see from the slide, we bucket costs into 3 areas: cost inflation other, which includes cost inflation, depreciation, cost savings and other items, mix and deleverage. The cost inflation bucket drove approximately 2/3 of the increase and was mostly due to higher materials, energy and transportation costs. Cost savings provided some offset, and we are pleased to report that we completed another successful cost savings program, delivering over the $600 million in targeted savings from 2020 to 2022.\nNow we also have an extensive hedging program, and it has helped to mitigate some of these cost pressures. But remember, certain costs like freight and raw material conversion costs third-party manufacturing contracts and not be hedged and are generally linked to inflationary indexes like PPI. And these costs can be material contributors to COGS. Other costs per hectoliter drivers were mix and volume deleverage. Mix was about 20% of the increase, and it was largely due to premiumization, and while premiumization is a negative for COGS, it is a positive for gross margin per hectoliter.\nTurning to marketing. As planned, it was down for the quarter. That said, we continue to put strong commercial pressure behind our core brands and innovation and the year-over-year comparison simply reflects the significantly higher spend in the prior year period when investments exceeded fourth quarter 2019 level.\nNow before I move on to our business unit performance, I wanted to call out 2 other items on our P&L in the quarter. We had $15 million discrete tax benefit, which resulted in lower than anticipated underlying effective tax rate for the quarter and for the full year. We do not expect this to repeat. Also, we recorded an $845 million noncash partial impairment charge in Americas due to macroeconomic factors like rising interest rates and increased cost inflation that reduced our future expected cash flows in the near to medium term. This charge was a result of our annual goodwill impairment review and is excluded from our underlying results.\nNow let's look at our quarterly results by business units. In the Americas, net sales revenue was up 0.4%, while underlying pretax income grew 29.8%. Americas net sales per hectoliter increased 12.1%, benefiting from strong net pricing growth and favorable U.S. brand mix. Financial volumes declined 10.5%. This was the result of lower brand volumes, which were down 6.6%. They were also down due to cycling significant distributor inventory bills in the U.S. in the prior year period, which we discussed last quarter. Taking a deeper look at brand volumes by region, the U.S. account 6.8%.\nNow we had some timing items that impacted this performance. First, there was 1 less trading day in the quarter. So on a trading day adjusted basis, U.S. brand volumes were down 5.4%. Additionally, as with any price increase, we experienced volume load-in from the forecast increase that shifted volume out of the fourth quarter.\nLooking at U.S. brand volume by price segment, our economy and premium portfolios were down high single digits on a non-trading day adjusted basis despite industry share trend improvement in economy and industry share gains in premium -- but our best premium brands grew in the quarter, up low single digits.\nIn Canada, industry softness resulted in brand volume declines of 5%. And in Latin America, they were down 6.9%. On the cost side, Americas underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 11.4%, while MG&A decreased 12.6%. The drivers were similar to those discussed for the consolidated results.\nTurning to EMEA and APAC. Net sales revenue increased 20.3% and underlying pretax income increased 515% or over $23 million. Positive net pricing, favorable sales mix on record premiumization fueled by the strength of brands like Madri and positive channel mix drove net sales per hectoliter growth of 14.9%. Financial volumes grew 4.7% on the strength of our above premium portfolio, including the benefits of cycling Omicron-related restrictions in the prior year period. Brand volumes declined 1%. While brand volumes grew in the U.K. and Central and Eastern Europe, they were more than offset by declines in our license and export business in markets impacted by the Russian war in Ukraine.\nOn the cost side, underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 16.5%, this is largely due to cost inflation, mainly higher materials, transportation and energy costs as well as mix from premiumization.\nNow let's look at the full year. Net sales per hectoliter were up 9.3% on strong global net pricing and positive sales mix across both business units. Financial volumes declined 2.1% and essentially in line with brand volumes, which were down 2%. Financial volume declines were due to the Americas where brand volumes declined 3.3% on softer U.S. and Canada beer industry and also the Quebec labor strike that impacted the second and third quarters of 2022. Conversely, financial and brand volumes were up in the U.K., given the resilience of the U.K. consumer in the quarter and cycling prior year on-premise restrictions.\nTurning to profitability. Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 11%. And when looking at our cost bucket, the biggest driver was cost inflation, which was over 60% of the increase and due to similar drivers as in the fourth quarter, and this was followed by mix, which contributed to nearly 30% of the increase. notably, underlying COGS per hectare to increase vary significantly by business unit, with Americas up approximately 10% and EMEA and APAC up to nearly 20%.\nMG&A increased 3.7%. This was mainly due to higher people-related G&A costs. Marketing spend declined for the year, but we continue to invest strongly behind our core brands and key innovation. And in fact, marketing investments was up for the full year when excluding discontinued brands. We delivered underlying free cash flow of $853 million for the year, this was down $230 million, primarily due to unfavorable timing of working capital and higher cash capital expenditures partially offset by lower cash taxes. Underlying free cash flow was below our guidance range, largely due to unfavorable movements in working capital compared to our initial expectations. We do not expect these working capital movements to impact us in 2023.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reduced net debt and return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures paid were $661 million for the year, up $139 million as we continue to expand our capabilities, as Gavin discussed. We continue to improve the health of our balance sheet by reducing net debt by $562 million during the year. We ended the year with net debt of $6 billion which is essentially all FX rate.\nOur exposure to floating rate debt is limited to our commercial paper and revolving credit facility, which had a 0 balance outstanding as of year-end. We achieved our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio guidance of under 3x, coming in at 2.9x at year-end. This is a dramatic improvement from the 4.8x in 2016 at the time of the MillerCoors acquisition.\nWe remain committed to maintaining and in time, improving our investment-grade rating and strive towards a longer-term leverage ratio target of approximately 2.5x. And we continued our long history of returning cash to our shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share paid in the fourth quarter. And on February 20, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share, an increase of 8%. This is our second increase since we reinstated the dividend in 2021, and it aligns with our intention to sustainably increase the dividend.\nNow let's discuss our outlook and recall that define year-over-year growth rate in constant currency. Our 2023 guidance anticipates continued growth despite softness in the beer industry and the impact of continued global inflationary cost pressures. We expect low single-digit growth for both net sales revenue and underlying pretax income and underlying free cash flow of $1 billion, plus or minus 10%.\nNow let me walk through some of the underlying assumptions. On the top line, we expect growth to be more rate than volume-driven as we continue to benefit from the strong global net pricing that we took in 2022 as well as premiumization. As a reminder, in 2022 in the U.S., our largest market, we took an average 5% increase in the first quarter and another 5% beginning in September and into the fourth quarter.\nIn terms of cost, we expect inflation to continue to be in which with our ongoing cost savings efforts -- pricing and continued premiumization, we expect to grow gross margin per hectoliter in both business units. We also remain comfortable with our hedge commodities coverage in 2023. But again, there are certain costs, as I discussed, that cannot be hedged and can be material contributors to cost.\nWe also expect to continue to strongly support our core brands and key innovations and plan to increase marketing dollar investments in 2023 versus the prior year. As for our secondary guidance metrics, we expect capital expenditures incurred of $700 million, plus or minus 5%. Underlying depreciation and amortization of $690 million, plus or minus 5%. Net interest expense of $240 million plus or minus 5% and an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%.\nIn closing, we are proud of our accomplishments in 2022, particularly amidst significant low inflationary pressures. We remain focused on continuing to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. And we are pleased to have a strong portfolio of brands that play across all price segments and the financial flexibility that enables us to continue to invest prudently in our business to support long-term growth.\nWith that, we look forward to answering your questions.

You can find related slides with an updated format on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website.\nOur speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVP of FP&A and IR, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThank you, Nadia, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with our IR team in the days and weeks that follow.\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nGAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year period.\nFurther, in our remarks today, we will reference underlying pretax income, which equates to underlying income before income taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWith that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I am pleased to report that Molson Coors grew both the top and bottom line on both the constant currency and an underlying basis in the third quarter.\nBut I'm particularly pleased because nearly 3 years into our revitalization plan to turn around this business, Molson Coors' top and bottom line growth is not just the story of a quarter, it's becoming a trend, and that is important.\nFor many, many years, you all knew Molson Coors as a cash-generative business that was willing to make hard cuts to meet the bottom line, but one that struggled mightily to grow the top line. When we launched our revitalization plan, the goal was to change that trajectory and position Molson Coors for sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth, and we are making progress.\nGoing back to the beginning of last year, we have grown on a constant currency basis, the top and bottom line on an underlying basis in 4 out of 7 quarters. We've logged 6 straight quarters of net sales revenue growth. We are growing net sales revenue in both business units.\nAnd through the third quarter of the year, our global net sales revenue is above 2019 levels on a constant currency basis. Those results are also translating into strong industry share performance in our largest global markets.\nAcross the U.S. beer industry, we earned the second highest dollar share gain and the best dollar share trend improvement in the quarter relative to the last 52 weeks. Moreover, our third quarter STR trend was the best quarterly performance we have seen in over a decade.\nWe again gained share in the U.K. We gained share in Canada year-to-date in factoring out Quebec, which was recovering from the strike earlier this year. So it's not surprising to us that 3 quarters of the way through 2022, we are able to reiterate the key financial metrics of our full-year guidance.\nNow I know that's [not a U.S. skeptical], but we have several tailwinds that give us confidence. We are benefiting from strong pricing in the U.S., Canada and EMEA and APAC.\nIn the U.S., by far our largest market, our recent actions mean pricing will be up close to 10% on average versus the fourth quarter of last year as opposed to our historical 1% to 2% annual price increase, and we will see that pricing benefit for the entirety of the quarter.\nOur U.K. and Canadian markets were heavily impacted by the Omicron variant in the fourth quarter of last year, which we will be comping. I know it's hard to remember that the on-premise in both markets was virtually closed for a portion of the quarter in 2021, and we do not foresee this happening again.\nAdditionally, as expected, we plan to have less marketing in the fourth quarter of this year, which relates to phasing as we think about how and when to most heavily market our brands. And we expect the World Cup to be a large benefit to our EMEA APAC business. It's a major on-premise beer occasion, particularly in Europe, and it has never been this late in the year.\nTracey will get into our guidance in more detail, but these are some of the factors that give us confidence to again reiterate our full-year key financial guidance. And I would point out that we can do so without contemplating some hockey stick trajectory for retail sales in the fourth quarter.\nNow while we don't believe that will impede our ability to deliver on our full-year guidance, I do want to take a couple of minutes to discuss two challenges that impacted our third quarter results because there are some notable trends we are beginning to see.\nFirst and most obviously, while the rapid rise in input costs is not new this quarter, what is noticeable is the difference in COGS inflation rates between the two sides of the Atlantic.\nWhile it was high in all our markets, underlying COGS per hectoliter rose nearly 14% in EMEA and APAC compared to about 11% in the Americas. While we have been aggressive in taking price compared to historical benchmarks in beer and we are deploying other levers to recover as much of these costs as possible, in some markets, it's been difficult to keep up with the ramp and pace of inflation.\nAnd in other markets like Central and Eastern Europe, some consumers simply cannot withstand higher levels of pricing. And that is the second trend, which is the diverging trend among our global markets. While volumes have remained strong elsewhere, we are seeing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry in our Central and Eastern European markets.\nCompared to the counterparts across the continent, these consumers tend to have less disposable income and are therefore more prone to inflationary pressure, which has put strain on this portion of our business, and that's in contrast to what we're seeing elsewhere.\nThe U.S. consumer remains resilient to date. The industry is continuing to trade up and we aren't seeing signs of significant channel shifting. September and third quarter on-premise mix of total volume has remained consistent with the year-to-date trend and above 2021 levels, and these trends are visible in the strong quarterly top line results for the Americas business unit.\nConsumer trends are similar in Canada, where the broader industry is seeing [trade-up] and our portfolio is premiumizing. Volumes are even holding up in the U.K. In the third quarter, on-premise volumes in this market were flat with pre-pandemic levels, despite the very volatile and uncertain economic environment there.\nSo again, no signs of significant channel shift in the U.K. Should consumer behavior in these other markets change, we have the right portfolio to compete in a more challenging economic environment. And thanks to the revitalization plan, we also have a business that is able to adjust the conditions more nimbly.\nSo we will continue to make the investments and decisions necessary to ensure this business delivers top and bottom line growth, not just for 1 quarter or for 1 year, but year after year after year. That consistent approach has been the determining factor in the progress we have made.\nWhen we launched the revitalization plan nearly 3 years ago, we told you we're working towards a stronger call, aggressive growth in above premium and scale beyond the beer [arm], and we continue to deliver. Our core brands have not only stabilized, they are getting stronger.\nIn the U.S., our premium brands are holding industry share. And the combination of Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet combined to grow over a full share point of the premium beer category. Miller Lite and Coors Banquet grew volume as well. In the U.K., Carling continues growing share of the familiar trusted lager segment and again widened its lead as the country's #1 beer.\nIn Canada, Molson Canadian continues to grow net sales revenue and share of segment, while Miller Lite brand volumes are growing double digits with the brand achieving industry share growth. And in Central and Eastern Europe, we are growing segment share with our national power brands in the majority of markets. Our global portfolio continues to premiumize rapidly.\nIn the U.K., Madri remains on an incredible rise. It is already our #3 brand in that market and has gained the most market share of any of our global brand innovations since the Molson Coors merger in 2005.\nTopo Chico Hard Seltzer remains the fastest-growing hard seltzer in the U.S. and was a top 5 industry growth brand in the quarter. Simply Spiked Lemonade is the fastest-growing new FAB in the U.S. and was also a top industry growth brand, finishing in the top 10. The Blue Moon family grew share of the craft segment in the U.S., while Peroni volumes were up double digits.\nIn Canada, our hard seltzers grew double digits and continued to gain share of the seltzer category with Vizzy and Coors Seltzer now the #4 and #6 seltzer brands, respectively.\nWe are also meaningfully expanding beyond the [beer]. And our Beyond Beer space is about to get bigger as we recently announced our emerging growth team plans to launch Topo Chico Spirited, an RTD cocktail early next year.\nThe continued strength of our brands helped our business deliver on the top line globally. And while COGS inflation globally and consumer weakness in Central and Eastern Europe hampered our bottom line results in the third quarter, today, we remain on track to grow our top line and bottom line this year for the first time in over a decade.\nWe have made substantial progress across this business in under 3 years. We've done it in spite of serious challenges no one saw coming, and we remain focused on setting up Molson Coors for long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth.\nNow to give you more details on the financials and outlook, I'll hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Joubert. Tracey?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. For the third quarter, we delivered another quarter of net sales revenue and underlying pretax growth. We continue to invest in our business. We reduced net debt, and we returned cash to shareholders.\nDespite the challenging global macro environment and overall industry softness, beer consumers remained resilient in our 3 major markets in the third quarter, while we saw softness in our Central and Eastern European business. And as expected, global inflationary pressures continue to be a headwind for our bottom line performance.\nTaking this all into account, we are maintaining our 2022 key financial guidance, but we do now expect underlying pretax income growth on a constant currency basis to be at the lower end of our high single-digit range.\nWhile we discuss our business performance on a constant currency basis, it is also relevant to consider the currency impact of the strong U.S. dollar, which was a meaningful headwind to the reported results in the quarter.\nOn a reported basis, our third quarter net sales revenue was negatively impacted by $109 million, and our underlying pretax income was negatively impacted by $21 million.\nBefore we discuss our quarterly performance, I wanted to provide some context on our on-premise recovery. Our third quarter on-premise has nearly fully recovered to 2019 total revenue level. However, in looking at the map on Slide 8, we can see there are variations by market. In the U.S., the on-premise reached 94% of 2019 total revenues, the highest since the pandemic.\nWhile in Canada, where on-premise restrictions have been more severe, the on-premise continued to improve on a sequential basis but has not returned to 2019 levels. However, in the U.K., similar to the second quarter, the on-premise well exceeded 2019 total revenues.\nNow I'll take you through our quarterly performance and our outlook. Turning to Slide 9. Consolidated net sales revenue grew 7.9%, driven by strong global net pricing and favorable sales mix. Consolidated financial volumes were essentially flat.\nAmericas shipments were down due to the continued impact of the Quebec labor strike, which was resolved in June, while financial volumes were higher in EMEA and APAC on increased U.K. brand volumes.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 9.2%, driven by strong global net pricing and positive sales mix across both business units. As expected, inflationary pressures continued to be a headwind in the quarter.\nAs you can see on Slide 10, underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 12%. The two biggest drivers were cost inflation and mix. Cost inflation comprised more than 2/3 of the increase and included higher input materials, transportation and energy costs.\nOur mix drove roughly 350 basis points of the increase and was due to premiumization, which is a negative in terms of COGS, but a positive in terms of gross margin.\nWhile inflation remains a significant headwind, we continue to judicially deploy our multiple levers, including pricing, premiumization and our hedging and cost savings programs to help mitigate the impact.\nAs it pertains to our hedging program, it is worth reminding that our program is longer term in nature as we hedge commodities over 1 to 3 years, and we operate within guardrails and take a more opportunistic rather than programmatic approach.\nThe purpose of the hedging program is to smooth out the impact of big swings in commodity prices. So in a situation like the third quarter, where we saw some sequential easing of certain commodities, it will take time to see that impact on the P&L.\nFurther, we are exposed to other costs that cannot be hedged, such as freight, but also material conversion costs and third-party manufactured contracts that extend over periods of time, which can be material contributors to our COGS.\nMG&A increased 3.5% as lower marketing spend was more than offset by higher G&A. Marketing investment decreased as we cycled higher spend in the prior year period when investments exceeded third quarter 2019 levels. We continue to provide strong commercial support behind our core brands and new innovations at the U.S. launch of Simply Spiked.\nG&A increased due to increased people-related costs, including travel and entertainment expenses and legal costs as well as cycling the Yuengling company equity income, which was included in G&A in the prior year period.\nNow let's take a look at our results by our business units. Turning to Slide 11, the Americas net sales revenue increased 7.4%, benefiting from net pricing growth and positive brand mix, partially offset by lower financial volumes. Americas financial volumes decreased 1%, driven by Canada, while U.S. domestic shipments increased 1.4%.\nAmericas brand volumes decreased 1.5%, driven by Quebec. And U.S. brand volume declined at 0.9%, which approximated industry performance. U.S. brand volume trends were driven by high single-digit declines in the economy brands largely due to the SKU rationalization program and to a lesser degree, by low single-digit declines in premium brands.\nConversely, the U.S. above premium portfolio continued to grow strongly, up low double digits for the quarter.\nBrand volumes in Latin America also increased. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 7.5% due to net pricing growth and favorable brand mix. And as you can see in the slide, strong pricing and premiumization in our 2 largest markets in the Americas, the U.S. and Canada, drove that performance.\nOn the cost side, Americas underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 11.4%. As with our consolidated results, the primary drivers were inflation, including higher materials, energy and transportation costs, as well as mix impacts from premiumization.\nMG&A decreased 1.4%, driven by lower marketing spend. As I mentioned, we strongly supported the national launch of Simply Spiked, but overall marketing spend declined due to lower U.S. national marketing and sales control spend related to alliance and media phasing.\nG&A increased as a result of the same drivers discussed for the consolidated G&A I mentioned earlier. As a result, Americas underlying pretax income increased 10.5%.\nTurning to EMEA and APAC on Slide 12. Net sales revenue increased 9.6%, driven by higher financial volumes, net pricing growth and favorable mix.\nFinancial volumes grew 2% due to higher brand volumes in Western Europe, where the demand remains strong, along with higher factored brand volumes. This was partially offset by brand volume declines due to Russia's war in Ukraine and weakened demand due to inflationary pressures in Central and Eastern Europe.\nEMEA and APAC net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis was up 14.3%, driven by positive net pricing as well as favorable sales mix driven by the strength in our above premium brands like Madri and positive geographic mix.\nOn the cost side, underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 13.8%. Similar to the Americas, the drivers were cost inflation and mix from premiumization.\nMG&A increased 21.7% as we accelerated market investments behind our national champion and above premium brands, especially in the U.K., supporting Carling, Madri and Staropramen and fueling on-premise strength. G&A also increased as we cycled lower relative spending in the prior year. As a result of these higher costs, EMEA and APAC, underlying pretax income declined 38.9%.\nTurning to Slide 13. Our underlying free cash flow was $597 million for the first 9 months of the year, a decrease of $336 million from the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and lower underlying pretax income, partially offset by the prior-year net repayment of various tax payment deferral programs related to the pandemic and lower cash taxes.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reduce net debt and to return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures paid were $531 million for the first 9 months of the year, an increase of $167 million from the prior year period.\nAnd we're focused on expanding our production capacity and capabilities program, which support improved efficiencies and help us deliver our sustainability goals.\nCapital expenditure levels remain in line with our expectations of approximating pre-pandemic annual levels. We ended the quarter with net debt of $6.1 billion, down nearly $500 million since December 31, 2021, and a trailing 12-month net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 3.13x, approaching our target of below 3x by the end of 2022.\nWe ended the quarter with $125 million of commercial paper outstanding. In this rising interest rate environment, it's notable that substantially all our debt is at fixed rates.\nIn terms of returning cash to shareholders during the third quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share to holders of Class A and B common stockholders. And we paid approximately $12.6 million for 230,000 shares under our share repurchase program, which is essentially an anti-dilution program for annual employee equity grant.\nNow let's discuss our outlook, which you can see on Slide 14. And while we start year-over-year growth rates in constant currency, please note that current exchange rates will generate a headwind in our fourth quarter reported results at similar relative levels to what we experienced in the third quarter due to the strength of the U.S. dollar.\nFor 2022, we are reaffirming our guidance of mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth, high single-digit underlying pretax income growth and underlying free cash flow of $1 billion, plus or minus 10%.\nHowever, given increased inflationary cost pressures and weakening demand in Central and Eastern Europe, we expect underlying pretax income growth to be at the lower end of the range.\nBased on our annual guidance, this would imply for the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis, underlying pretax income growth in the range of approximately 45% to 60%, and we expect to be at the lower end of the range.\nNow let me walk through some of the assumptions that will help you understand why we have reaffirmed our guidance.\nGavin has already discussed some of the top line drivers like our full pricing in the U.S., easing comparisons in the U.K. and Canada and the World Cup tournament. Also, in the fourth quarter, we have fully lapped the shipment headwind from our economy SKU rationalization.\nThese drivers are partially offset by weakened demand in Central and Eastern Europe. From a COGS point of view, we continue to expect margins to be impacted by inflationary pressures, particularly with acceleration in commodity costs in EMEA and APAC.\nBut offsetting some of the inflation costs, we continue to expect our cost savings program to be weighted to the fourth quarter. And we now expect lower depreciation, which is due to the timing of capital projects and the impact of significant foreign exchange movements.\nTurning to marketing, we continue to expect overall spend to be down in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. We are comfortable with our planned level of marketing investment, which is comparing against the prior year period when marketing investment exceeded 2019 levels.\nLooking out to 2023, while we are not prepared to provide any guidance, we remain committed to putting the right commercial pressure behind our core brands and key innovations, including our first official Super Bowl ad in more than 30 years. In terms of our other guidance metrics, we continue to expect net interest expense of $265 million, plus or minus 5%.\nHowever, we are lowering our underlying effective tax rate to a range of 21% to 22% from our prior guidance range of 22% to 24%. And we are lowering our underlying depreciation and amortization to $700 million, plus or minus 5% from our previous guidance of $750 million, plus or minus 5% for the reasons I just mentioned.\nSo in closing, we put up another quarter of growth and did so in a challenging macro environment. While these remain dynamic and uncertain times, under our revitalization plan, we have built our business to manage through challenges.\nWith strong brands across all our segments and greatly enhanced financial and operational flexibility, we remain confident in our ability to navigate near-term macro challenges while investing in the business and staying the course towards our goal of long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth.\nAnd with that, we look forward to answering your questions.

K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThanks, Greg. In the second quarter of 2022, we achieved direct strike at our Montreal brewery. Globally, we have now recorded 5 revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Molson Coors grew dollar share in the U.S. in the 13-week quarter, both of which have not been achieved in over a decade. 1 of only 2 major beer companies to achieve dollar share growth in the 13-week time frame.\nIn Canada, Molson Coors grew volume and share when you factor out Quebec due to the Quebec labor strike. In the U.K., Molson Coors grew share and achieved the highest on-premise trailing 12-month average share also in over a decade. And we are currently the largest share gainer of the U.K. beer industry. So in aggregate, across our 3 largest markets, we are outpacing the industry and continuing to grow the top line globally. And these results are no accident. They're not a coincidence. These are the rewards of our continued commitment to and execution of the revitalization plan. So our plan is working and that fact gives us continued confidence that we are on track to deliver on our guidance for 2022.\nYou can see it in our core brands with stronger brand fundamentals and consistent investments since we launched the revitalization plan of paying off. In the second quarter, Coors Light and Miller Lite achieved the best quarterly industry share performance in the U.S. in nearly 7 years. While Miller Lite grew share of industry in the quarter, results are driven by clear distinctive positioning of our 2 biggest brands and more effective marketing. We are demonstrating the power of our biggest brands, and we intend to keep investing behind them.\nCoors Banquet, our oldest brand in the U.S. is also one of our fastest-growing beer brands with dollar sales up double digits and growing share of the total beer industry, fueled by a new generation of drinkers. In Canada, Molson Canadian is growing share of the total beer industry for the first time in 8 years. In the U.K., Carling, the largest beer brand in the U.K., managed to further solidify its #1 position in the total market, in the majority of their markets.\nAround the world, our core brands are not just stronger than they've been in many years, our core brands are outpacing the rest of the beer industry, an incredible foundation for our business to build on. We also continue to find success in premiumizing our business even in challenging economic times. Our Above Premium brands again hit a record high portion of our global portfolio net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis with positive progress made across the business. The net sales revenue of our U.S. Above Premium portfolio is now higher than the net sales revenue of our U.S. Economy portfolio on a trailing 12-month basis. That trend was driven by the rapid growth of our Hard Seltzers, the strong launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and Blue Moon and Peroni's continued drivers coming out of the pandemic.\nLast quarter, our share the U.S. Hard Seltzer segment grew by 25% from just over 7% in the first quarter to over 9% in the second quarter, and our Hard Seltzers are currently growing share of the total beer industry. That growth once again makes Molson Coors the fastest-growing Hard Seltzers portfolio in the U.S. Not only has busy grown Seltzers share during this period, the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer has quickly become the fastest-growing Hard Seltzer in the U.S. and was a top 5 industry growth brand in the quarter.\nWe said that Simply Spiked Lemonade would redefine the full flavor alcohol beverage segment, and today, the results back that up. In just a few weeks, we have sold over 60,000 hectoliters, achieved a 3.5 share of F&B segment in the latest 4-week read from IRR, and it is already one of the top FMBs in several major grocery retailers.\nIn addition, brand volumes for Blue Moon were up high single digits, while Peroni was up high teens on a year-to-date basis. And our business globally continues to premiumize as well. In our Latin American business, where most of our brands sell at an Above Premium price points, we continue to grow volume in the second quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the Colombia, Chile and Honduras market. Additionally, in Mexico, Coors Light is back to healthy growth, up double digits versus the prior year, while Miller High Life earned a record sales month in June.\nIn the U.K., Coors is gaining share of the total beer industry, and Madri's growth is amazing. Madri has seen the most value growth of any brand in its first year in the U.K. on-premise, making it the most successful launch in the entire 16 years that the on-premise measurement service has been tracking the industry. There's been 2 years after its launch, the brand has sold over 200,000 hectoliters in the first half of 2022 alone, making it one of the top 20 U.K. beers and have only just launched in the off-premise in March. This is a brand you also get to know, because you're going to be hearing a lot about it in the years to come.\nAnd Praha, a relatively newer pilsner from Staropramen has earned strong results in Central and Eastern Europe, and successfully launched this year in Romania. This will be its second largest market to date, and we believe this expansion has the potential to significantly increase Praha's volumes.\nOur Canadian business also continues to premiumize, of particular note in that market is our Six Pints craft beer division, which is growing at about 4x the rate of the craft beer category in Canada. Premium Lager specifically grew by over 30% in the second quarter. And our Canadian Hard Seltzers portfolio continues to grow. We grew share of the segment in the second quarter. Coors Seltzer is the now the #7 hard seltzer in Canada and Vizzy is #5. Combined, we're over 12 shares of the Canadian hard seltzer segment in the latest month, and that's before Topo Chico Hard Seltzer are launched nationally in Canada.\nNow I can imagine that you're all thinking that premiumization is very nice, but how well are we prepared for a recessionary environment. First, we do continue to see trade-up in our portfolio and in the industry across our major markets, as you can see from what I just shared. But it's also true and notable that the Economy segment is strengthening in the U.S. and 3 of our 4 key Economy brands grew segment share in the second quarter. In fact, our Economy portfolio has had its best quarterly performance versus the industry in the last 3 years. And excluding the discontinued brands from the SKU rationalization program, our Economy brands grew share of total industry in the quarter.\nWe have long held but all segments natural in the beer industry, and it's never truer than it is in these times. The shape of our portfolio even as we continue to premiumize it ensures that we have strong offerings and strong brands for consumers across the range of price points. That gives us the ability to adapt our plans should the need arise regardless of the economic climate.\nWhile Tracey will go into more detail, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge some of the one-off challenges we faced in the second quarter. The 11-week Quebec labor strike adversely affected our Americas and global top line results. The Quebec labor strike ended in June and employees returned to the brewery and distribution center just a few days later. I'm pleased with the performance as we get the facility back up and running. Out of an abundance of caution, we also conducted a voluntary withdrawal of nearly 2 million cases of beer due to a quality issue at one of our U.S. breweries. And importantly, there were no health or safety risks. We have taken steps to correct the problem. And because our national inventory position on these SKUs is stronger than it has been in years, we were also able to divert production into this market from other breweries and quickly replenish supply.\nSo the good news in both instances, if there any, is that both situations have been addressed, and we still met the projection that we laid out for you earlier this year. That is a testament to the health of our business. I know it is reasonable to say that 3 years ago, either one of these issues would have been severely damaging to our business. Now they're certainly not helpful, and we're not looking to repeat them, but they have not taken us off course. And we own this improved health of the business to the clear progress Molson Coors has made through our consistent execution of the revitalization plan over the past few years. Our plan is working, but I'm also realistic about the challenging global macroeconomic environment in which we are operating. It's created uncertainty for our consumers, our business, our competitors and really all businesses in the consumer goods space. And yet the progress we have made in improving the health of our brands and our business has us well positioned to navigate the current economic climate and to deliver on our full year guidance.\nToday, we have a portfolio that is well positioned to successfully compete within the entire range of consumer demand, whether that be taste or price. We have a timing benefit in the second half of this year as we gradually diminish how much of the last year's U.S. inventory rebuild we will be lapping. Additionally, by the fourth quarter, we will no longer be lapping the shipment headwind from the SKU rationalization program from last year.\nIn Canada and Europe, some of our biggest global markets and ones in which the Christmas season is among the most important beer selling occasions, we have the prospects of a strong fourth quarter, thanks to waning coronavirus restrictions. And as Tracey will discuss in more detail, we will have the benefits of our fourth quarter U.S. price increase, which will further help offset inflation. All of this, combined with the strength of our brands gives us the continued confidence to reaffirm our guidance of top and bottom line growth for the year.\nAnd now to give you more detail on the financials and outlook, I'll hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Joubert. Tracey?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. For the second quarter, we delivered another quarter of top line growth on a constant currency basis and achieved income before income tax at the favorable end of our anticipated range, while we continue to invest in our business, reduce net debt and return cash to shareholders. We did this while navigating global inflationary pressures, the Quebec labor strike and starting a strong shipment quarter in the prior year. Our performance and our organizational agility demonstrates our successes against our revitalization plan. And it's the efforts and outcomes of that plan that provide us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance which calls for both top and bottom line growth for the year.\nNow I'll take you through our quarterly performance and our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 2.2%, driven by strong EMEA and APAC growth. As restrictions have eased, we have seen sequential improvement in the on-premise performance with variations by market and total net sales revenue returned to 99% of 2019 levels. Consolidated net sales revenue growth was driven by strong global net pricing, favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization, and positive channel mix. These factors were partially offset by lower financial volumes.\nConsolidated financial volumes decreased 4.6% as we cycled distributed inventory recovery efforts in the second quarter of 2021. The impact from the Quebec labor strike as well as lower U.S. Economy brand volumes, driven by our SKU deprioritization and rationalization program that started in the second quarter of 2021. These factors were partially offset by strong financial volume growth in EMEA and APAC, due to higher brand volumes and factor volumes, along with growth in our U.S. Above Premium portfolio.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 7.1%, driven by global net pricing and positive brand and channel mix, with premiumization delivered across both business units. Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 11.5%, driven by cost inflation, including higher input and transportation costs, mix impact from premiumization and factored brands in EMEA and APAC as well as deleverage. This was partially offset by lower depreciation expense.\nUnderlying MG&A in the quarter increased 7.5%. G&A was up due to higher people-related costs including increased travel and entertainment, which marketing investment increased as we continued to provide strong commercial support behind our core brands and new innovation. As a result of these factors, underlying net income before income taxes decreased 22.8%, which was at the favorable end of our outlook range of down 20% to 30%.\nWhile we discuss our business performance on a constant currency basis, on a reported basis, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. This impacted our reported net sales revenue by 280 basis points, and our underlying income before income tax by 150 basis points in the quarter.\nUnderlying free cash flow was $287 million for the first half of the year, a decrease of $271 million from the same period last year, primarily due to the timing of cash paid for capital expenditures and lower net income, partially offset by lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures paid were $389 million for the first half of the year, an increase of $177 million from the prior year period and focused on expanding our production capacity and capabilities program.\nNow let's take a look at our results by business units. In Americas, the on-premise has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, but continues to improve on a sequential quarterly basis. In the second quarter, the Americas on-premise channel accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales revenue compared to approximately 16% in the same period in 2019. In the U.S., on-premise net sales revenue improved to 93% of 2019 levels compared to 87% in the first quarter of 2022. And in Canada, on-premise net sales revenue was 77% of 2019 levels, up from 55% in the first quarter of 2022.\nAmericas net sales revenue was down 1.7% as net pricing growth in the U.S. and Canada and positive brand mix were offset by lower financial volumes as declines were expected. Americas financial volumes decreased 8.1%, largely due to cycling higher U.S. shipments due to the prior year period inventory recovery efforts as well as 2.2% lower brand volumes, including impacts related to the Quebec labor strike.\nIn the U.S., net sales revenue declined 2.1% with domestic shipments down 8.2%, outpacing brand volume decline of 1.7%. Brand volume declines were driven by Economy brands, which were down high single digits, largely due to the SKU deprioritization and rationalization program. To a lesser degree, our premium brand volumes also declined, reflective of a soft industry.\nVolume declines were offset by continued strength in the Above Premium portfolio, which was up nearly double digits for the quarter. In Canada, net sales revenue decreased 2.3% as brand volume declines of 8%, driven by the Montreal brewery strike, were largely offset by positive pricing, premiumization and channel mix.\nLatin America net sales revenue decreased slightly as higher brand volume of 1.8% was offset by mix shift to our licensed business. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 6.2% due to net pricing growth and favorable brand mix. U.S. net sales per hectoliter increased 6.7%, driven by net pricing growth and positive brand mix led by the Above Premium brands. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew 8% in Canada due to net pricing increases and positive sales mix, while Latin America decreased 4.2% due to unfavorable sales mix.\nAmericas COGS per hectoliter increased 10.2% due to inflation, including higher cost for brewery, packaging and brewing materials and freight as well as volume deleverage and mix impacts from premiumization, and this was partially offset by lower depreciation.\nUnderlying MG&A increased mid-single digits on higher G&A due to increased people-related costs, travel and entertainment expenses, and increased U.S. marketing investments. In the U.S., the increased marketing investments high single digits, putting strong support behind our core brands and innovation including Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and the June national launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade as well as in local sponsorship and events. As a result, America's underlying net income before income taxes decreased 20%.\nTurning to EMEA and APAC. Net sales revenue increased 20.5%, driven by higher financial volume, net pricing growth, and favorable mix. Top line performance also benefited from fewer on-premise restrictions in the U.K. compared to the second quarter of 2021. Recall that the on-premise in the U.K. was closed the entire first quarter of 2021 and did not fully reopen without restrictions until July 19, 2021. So in the second quarter, our on-premise net sales revenue in the U.K. exceeded 2019 second quarter levels. EMEA and APAC net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis was up 15.5%, driven by positive sales mix for the on-premise reopenings and strengthen Above Premium brands as well as net pricing growth.\nFinancial volumes growth of 6.2% was due to higher brand volumes in Western Europe as well as in Central and Eastern Europe, along with higher factor brand volumes. Cost per hectoliter increased 22% due to rising inflationary pressures and increased factor brand sales.\nMG&A increased 14.2% as we cycled lower relative G&A spending in the prior year and increased marketing spend, accelerating investments behind our national champion and premium brands, especially in the U.K. supporting Carling, Madri and Staropramen and fueling on-premise strength. As a result of these higher costs, EMEA and APAC underlying net income before income tax declined 22.7%.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our priorities are to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reduce net debt and to return cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, which included the repayment of our $500 million, 3.5% USD notes upon maturity on May 1, 2022, using a combination of commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand. Notably and are particularly important during these volatile times, our debt is substantially all at fixed rates with a minimal amount of variable rate debt.\nWe ended the quarter with $250 million of commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with strong borrowing capacity with $1.3 billion available on our $1.5 billion U.S. revolving credit facility. Our trailing 12-month net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio was 3.2x as of the end of the second quarter, down from 3.35x at the end of the second quarter in 2021. We remain on track to achieve our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of below 3x by the end of 2022 and remain committed to maintaining any time, upgrading our investment-grade rating.\nAlso, during the second quarter, in addition to paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.58 per share to holders of Class A and B common stockholders. We paid approximately $12.1 million for 250,000 shares under our share repurchase program.\nNow let's discuss our outlook, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, which calls for both top and bottom line growth in 2022, performance we have not seen in over a decade. Before we go through the guidance, deeply reminded that year-over-year growth rates are on a constant currency basis. However, it's important to note that continued strength in the U.S. dollar will result in a headwind to our reported results in the effective period using current exchange rates.\nFor 2022, we continue to expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth, high single-digit underlying income before income taxes growth, and underlying free cash flow of $1 billion, plus or minus 10%. We are confident to reaffirm this guidance as our announced 3% to 5% pricing increase in some U.S. markets, as Gavin mentioned, are expected to offset volume headwinds given the softness in the industry and residual impact of the Montreal brewery strike that was resolved in June.\nIn terms of top line phasing, in the third quarter, we will still have some volume headwinds from the Economy SKU rationalization program, which we will not fully lap from a shipment perspective until the fourth quarter. Also, while the Quebec labor strike was resolved in mid-June, it will take time to ramp up production and we don't anticipate returning to normal shipment levels from this brewery until the fourth quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, we had multiple top line growth drivers. First, we have announced additional pricing in the 3% to 5% range in many markets in the U.S. That pricing will take effect in the fourth quarter. Second, recall that year-over-year top line comparisons will begin to ease in the fourth quarter, given the renewed on-premise restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, particularly in the U.K. and Canada. And in November, the World Cup will take place, which is a big beer drinking occasion in Europe and notably the U.K. Third, as I just mentioned, we will have fully lapped the shipment headwind from Economy SKU rationalization by the fourth quarter.\nOn the cost side, we expect margins to continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures in areas including input materials and transportation costs in the second half of the year. That said, we have multiple levers to help offset inflationary pressures, which include pricing, mix from premiumization, and our cost savings and hedging programs. When comparing year-over-year COGS per hectoliter growth for the second half of the year to the second quarter, it's important to note a few things. First, the second quarter was meaningfully impacted by volume deleverage, which we would not expect to continue in the second half of the year. And due to the timing and ramp-up of initiatives, the realization of savings and our cost savings program is weighted to the fourth quarter of this year.\nIn terms of marketing, we continue to expect to invest more in 2022 than we did 2021, but in the second half of the year, overall marketing spend is expected to be down compared to the prior year period. We anticipate higher year-over-year investment in the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, we do not anticipate increases. We are comfortable with our level of marketing investment in the second half of the year and would remind you that in the second half of 2021, we had ramped up marketing levels to those exceeding that of the respective period in 2019.\nIn terms of our other guidance metrics, we continue to expect net interest expense of $265 million, plus or minus 5%. Underlying depreciation and amortization guidance of $750 million plus or minus 5% and an underlying effective tax range rate in the range of 22% to 24%.\nIn closing, our strategy is working, and we expect that to continue to play out in our long-term financial and operational performance. To be sure, these are dynamic and uncertain times, but we have built our business to manage through challenges. Molson Coors is a highly cash-generative business with a dramatically improved balance sheet, enhanced flexibility in its operating and cost structure, and a product portfolio that addresses all segments of the market while consistently evolving its concentration to areas of growth. We are proud of the progress we have made against the revitalization plan and the successes achieved under that plan give us confidence in our 2022 guidance and in our long-term goal of sustainable top and bottom line growth.\nAnd with that, we look forward to answering your questions.

You can find related slides on the Investor Relations page of the Molson Coors website.\nOur speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Tierney\n\nVP of FP&A and IR, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nAll right. Thank you, Brica, and hello, everyone.\nFollowing our prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nGAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release. Also unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars and in constant currency when discussing percentage changes from the prior year period.\nSo with that, over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin D. K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThank you, Greg.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Molson Coors continued to generate positive trends, giving us continued confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance. We grew the top line by double digits and the bottom line on an underlying basis by triple digits. Top line growth has historically been a challenge for this business, but through our strong execution of the revitalization plan, we have now grown the top line for 4 consecutive quarters. The top line growth we generated in the last quarter was our largest quarterly top line growth in over a decade. Our core brands continue to outperform their peers. Our global Above Premium portfolio continued to grow, again, achieving a record portion of our overall portfolio by volume and revenue.\nTo put a finer point on it, in the U.S., the economy segment accounted for more than 100% of our volume decline following our decision to streamline and strengthen this part of our portfolio. Our expansion beyond the beer aisle continues meaningfully as well as generated its largest sales month ever this March. And we continue to invest in our capabilities, most notably with a project that also increases the profitability of one of our fastest-growing beverages, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer.\nCollectively, these are the core tenets of the revitalization plan we laid out for you over 2 years ago, and it is very heartening to see our business generating consistent results in each of these areas.\nOur core brands globally had another very strong quarter. In Canada, Coors Light grew share of the beer category, and our national champion brands in EMEA and APAC saw significant improvements with the reopening of the on-premise channel.\nYou will recall that pubs in the U.K. were closed the entire first quarter of 2021. But by the end of the first quarter of 2022, beer sales in pubs were back to 98% of pre-corona virus levels, and this was particularly beneficial to our Carling brand, the largest beer brand in the U.K.\nAs a result, in the first quarter, the EMEA and APAC business unit substantially improved its earnings and nearly doubled its 2021 revenue. In fact, we exceeded our EMEA and APAC first quarter 2019 revenues, which is a fantastic sign and further evidence of the value of increasing marketing spend behind our brands there.\nIn the U.S., Coors Light and Miller Lite continued their strong performance, made possible due to a multiyear approach that is clearly bearing fruit. These 2 brands compete in the same segment. So for years, it seemed virtually impossible to get them both moving in the right direction at the same time.\nIn the late summer and early fall of 2019 under Michelle St. Jacques, our Chief Marketing Officer, the marketing team made an intentional decision to bifurcate how we market these 2 brands, [because therefore] what makes them unique in the marketplace and how they show up in ads.\nYou can see that in the Coors Light Made to Chill campaign and in Miller Lite's work since then. Coors Light's Made Chill campaign generated an immediate improvement in brand health in 2019, and that improvement has held since. And ROI on the marketing campaigns for our Premium Light brands has significantly grown.\nCombined, our new approach, better marketing and increased investment, as on-premise restrictions have eased, resulted in sequential improvement over the past few years. Coors Light went from being down mid-single digits in net sales revenue in 2018 to growing by 4% in 2021.\nVolume also went from down mid-single-digits to nearly flat in 2021. Miller Lite went from 0.5% down net sales revenue in 2018 to growing 7% in 2021, and the brand's volume went from down [12.1%] to almost nearly flat in 2021.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we again grew revenue for both brands and generated the best combined industry share performance in 5 years. And while our core brands have been building strength over the past 2 to 3 years, we have continually grown our Above Premium portfolio across each business unit. We have now grown our share of net sales revenue in Above Premium for 5 straight quarters, and Above Premium net sales revenue now represents over 26% of our global portfolio on a trailing 12-month basis, a record for this business since the 2016 MillerCoors acquisition.\nWe again enjoyed the largest growth in U.S. sales of any major brewer. That's been fueled in large part by the successful national launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which is the fastest-growing major seltzer in the country. We only see further upside for this brand as we introduce the new Margarita packs.\nAnd with respect to investments in our capabilities, I would note that in the first quarter, we completed a capital project at our Fort Worth brewery. This project allows us to begin to bring the U.S. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer production in house, improving our profitability with the brand.\nOur share of the hard seltzer market in Canada continues to be very strong, with impressive performance by both Vizzy and Coors Seltzer. We expect to see those results only improve further when we introduced Topo Chico Hard Seltzer to the Canadian market next month.\nBut our premiumization is also being driven by growth in Above Premium beers around the world. Praha, a relatively new pilsner from Staropramen has earned strong results in Central and Eastern Europe and has now launched in Romania. This will be its second largest market to date, and we believe this expansion has the potential to dramatically increase Praha's volumes.\nMadri is performing well beyond expectations in the U.K., with distribution in over 6,000 on-premise accounts. With strength in the on-premise alone earned Madri as part of one the top 25 U.K. beers. And in March, we launched it in the off-premise.\nIn Canada, Molson Ultra has posted 47% volume growth from 2019 to 2021. And just last month, we launched a new campaign to fuel momentum. And our Canada craft business Six Pints grew 5x the growth of the total craft segment in Canada in the first quarter.\nIn the U.S., both Blue Moon and Peroni saw double-digit net sales revenue growth in the first quarter, as they benefited from the on-premise recovery as well as strong results off-premise. And there is more premiumization coming, most notably as we launch Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. next month. We are pleased to bring this highly anticipated product to the growing flavored alcohol beverage space as our next major initiative with Coca-Cola.\nWe also continue to drive the scale beyond beer, particularly with ZOA. The brand continues its strong growth, achieving a record sales month in March, and the data behind those results suggest a very bright future for ZOA. After a year in the market, its retail sales and distribution numbers broke records for a new entrant in the healthy energy drink category.\nThere are, of course, other pressing signs in our work to expand beyond beer. Five Trail, our first full-strength bottled spirit has now expanded to 2 more states based on the strong results from its initial 4 markets.\nAnd La Colombe is growing rapidly. While the ready-to-drink tea and coffee category is up 1% in dollar share per IRI in the first quarter, La Colombe is up 17%.\nCollectively, our emerging growth division remains well on track to achieving its $1 billion annual revenue goal by the end of 2023. As we continue to execute our revitalization plan around the world, we continue to turn around our entire business. Our improving results, which we are now generating quarter after quarter, give us continued confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance.\nBut it's not necessarily a straight path over each quarter. There are unique headwinds for our business in the second quarter and tailwinds for our business in the second half that we believe keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance, and Tracey will go over those in more detail.\nThere are also broader issues and trends happening outside of our business that we are monitoring closely. First, inflationary pressure. We have multiple levers, including pricing, premiumization, our hedging program and our cost savings program to mitigate inflationary pressure. There have been huge assets, but inflation is a real and growing challenge, and we anticipate the impact of inflation will worsen over the course of the year.\nIt's important to note, though, that we are not seeing raw material shortages. Globally, we continue to have access to the materials we need to produce, package and ship our beverages. As we head into the peak selling season, we are in our best U.S. inventory position since before the pandemic. And we continue to see out-of-stock levels on our core SKUs at or below pre-pandemic levels.\nSecond, consumer behavior. For example, volumes are universally soft across the U.S. beer industry to start the year. This was most pronounced in January as a result of the surge of the Omicron variant. While there has been improvement in February and March, it hasn't been at the pace we would have expected or that we saw after previous waves of the pandemic.\nI would point out, though, that Molson Coors industry share trends have continued to improve, both in the quarter and into April. In fact, the U.S. saw its best quarterly dollar share trend in over 7 years this past quarter.\nAnd despite high inflation in our biggest global markets, consumers continue to trade up, not down. And while it may seem counterintuitive, this trend is consistent with consumer behavior in the recent economic downturns. However, should that change and should trade down actually occur, our economy portfolio is well positioned to capitalize.\nThe SKU rationalization we conducted in the U.S. in 2021 didn't just make our economy portfolio smaller. We made it stronger and more efficient. By focusing on 4 key brands in 4 key verticals, instead of managing a long tail of smaller brands, we are able to put more effort and energy behind our biggest brands in the economy space.\nAnd finally, the Russian war in Ukraine. We quickly stopped all exports to Russia and paused the licensed production of our other brands there. Collectively, however, the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian markets account for a very small portion of our global business, and we have no breweries there, so it has had minimal direct impact on our global business.\nFurther, our focus has been on arranging safe passage, accommodations and financial support as it's needed for our Ukraine-based colleagues and for the Ukrainian friends and family of other colleagues in the business. And while we will continue to monitor consumer health in Europe, along with the cost of and access to input materials, we have been able to manage these challenges to date for our business.\nIn summary, it was another positive quarter for Molson Coors, another quarter of successful execution on our revitalization plan and another quarter of continually improving results for this business. And all of this was achieved in a very challenging macro environment that we are continuing to monitor closely. Folks, we're delivering in ways this business has not done for many years, and our future is bright.\nNow to give you more detail on that, I'd like to hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Joubert. Tracey?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone.\nAs Gavin highlighted, while macro trends have been challenging, we had a strong first quarter, delivering double-digit top line and triple-digit underlying bottom line growth. We achieved our highest quarterly top line growth in over a decade, as we continue to premiumize our product portfolio through the execution of our revitalization plan.\nWhile we, along with the rest of the world, are facing inflationary pressures, our efforts over the last 2 years have built a strong foundation for future growth and had given us confidence to reaffirm fiscal 2022 guidance for both top and bottom line growth.\nNow I'll take you through our quarterly performance and our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 17.6%, with strong growth in both our EMEA and APAC and Americas business units. On-premise, net sales revenue has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels in all markets. But as on-premise restrictions have eased, we have seen sequential improvement in the on-premise net sales revenue performance with variations by market.\nConsolidated net sales revenue growth was driven by strong global net pricing, favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization, positive channel mix as we cycled significant on-premise restrictions in the prior year period, and we also delivered higher financial volumes.\nConsolidated financial volumes increased 5.1%, largely driven by strong brand volume growth in EMEA and APAC, higher contract and factored volumes and cycling of lower U.S. distributor inventory levels in the prior year. This was partially offset by a decline in Americas brand volumes, which was driven by lower U.S. economy brand volumes as a result of our economy SKUs deprioritization and rationalization program implemented in the second quarter of 2021.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 10.2% driven by global net pricing growth and positive brand and channel mix, with premiumization delivered across both business units.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis, which is an important metric from which to measure our progress against our revitalization plan increased 12.2% compared to the first quarter of 2019.\nUnderlying COGS per hectoliter increased 8.6% driven by cost inflation, including higher input and transportation costs as well as the mix impact from premiumization and factored brands in Europe, partially offset by lower depreciation expense.\nUnderlying MG&A in the quarter increased 15.7%, largely due to our planned increases in marketing investment, which surpassed first quarter 2021 and 2019 levels to provide strong commercial support behind our core brands and new innovations. G&A was up due to higher people-related costs, including increased travel and entertainment.\nAs a result of these factors as well as lower interest and depreciation, underlying net income before income taxes increased 383.1%. Underlying free cash flow used was $359 million, an increase of cash used of $271 million in the same period last year. This increase in cash used was primarily due to higher capital project spending, partially offset by favorable timing and working capital.\nCapital expenditures paid were $244 million and focused on expanding our production capacity and capabilities programs, such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization projects and expanding our hard seltzer capacity in Canada and the U.K.\nNow let's look at our results for our business units. In Americas, the on-premise has not returned to pre-pandemic levels but continues to improve on a sequential-quarter basis. In the first quarter, the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 15% of our net sales revenue compared to approximately 18% in the same period in 2019.\nIn the U.S., on-premise net sales revenue was about 87% of 2019 levels. And in Canada, on-premise net sales revenue was about 55% of 2019 levels because, even though the on-premise restrictions continue to ease, they still impacted results.\nAmericas net sales revenue was up 8.5%, as net pricing growth across the business units and positive brand mix was partly offset by lower volumes. Americas financial volumes decreased 0.8%, largely due to 3.1% lower brand volume, partially offset by cycling lower U.S. distributor inventory levels due to the March 2021 cybersecurity incident and the February 2021 severe Texas storm.\nIn the U.S., net sales revenue grew 8.9%, with domestic shipments down 2%, outpacing brand volume declines of 4.3%. More than 100% of the U.S. brand volume declines were due to lower U.S. economy brand volume.\nIn the U.S., our economy portfolio was down high teens, while our Above Premium portfolio was at the mid-teens for the quarter.\nIn Canada, net sales revenue increased 4.1%, as brand volume declines of 4.5% due to softer industry performance more than offset by positive pricing and mix premiumization.\nLatin America net sales revenue increased 29.7% on brand volume growth of 13.8%.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 9.8%, with strong net pricing growth and favorable U.S. brand mix. U.S. net sales per hectoliter increased 11.1% driven by net pricing growth as we took pricing earlier than usual this year, and positive brand mix led by above premium innovation brands.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew high single digits in Canada due to net pricing increases and positive sales mix, while Latin America increased low double digits due to favorable sales mix.\nAmericas COGS per hectoliter increased 6.7% due to inflation, including brewing and packaging materials and freight as well as mix impact from premiumization, partially offset by lower depreciation.\nUnderlying MG&A increased 14.7%, as we increased marketing investments behind our core brands and innovations, including the national launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer as well as in local sponsorships and events, as pandemic-related restrictions eased versus the same period last year. G&A was up as well due to increased people-related costs and legal and travel and entertainment expenses. Americas underlying net income before income taxes increased 9%.\nTurning to EMEA and APAC. Net sales revenue grew 92.3% driven largely by Eastern Europe, but we also experienced growth in Central and Eastern Europe. Top line performance also benefited from fewer on-premise restrictions in the U.K. compared to the full closure in the first quarter of 2021. The U.K. on-premise channel net sales revenue exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the quarter.\nEMEA and APAC net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis was up 30.1% driven by positive sales mix with the on-premise reopenings and Above Premium brands reaching another record high portion of the portfolio as well as net pricing growth.\nEMEA and APAC financial volume increased 29.4%, and brand volumes increased 19.8%. The increase was primarily due to higher U.K. volumes, partially offset by declines in Central Europe and our export and license division.\nStrength in our core brands, like Carling and new innovations like Madri, led to strong double-digit growth in Above Premium and premium volumes, partially offset by double-digit declines in the economy.\nCOGS per hectoliter increased 29.3% due to rising inflationary pressures and increased factored brand sales.\nMG&A increased 19.4% as we cycled mitigation efforts to lower cost in the prior year, with on-premise restrictions and higher marketing investments to support our brands and fuel on-premise strength.\nEMEA and APAC underlying net loss before income tax improved 62.1%. We ended the quarter with net debt of $6.9 billion and a trailing 12-month net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 3.28x compared to 3.14x as of the end of 2021.\nWith the first quarter typically being a cash use quarter, this leverage ratio was up from the fourth quarter, which is typical between fourth and first quarters. Still, our leverage ratio remains substantially below the end of the first quarter of 2021 when it was 3.74x.\nWe ended the quarter with $160 million of commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with strong borrowing capacity, with $1.34 billion available on our $1.5 billion U.S. revolving credit facility.\nNow let's discuss our outlook. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, which calls for both top and bottom line growth in 2022, performance we have not seen in over a decade.\nBefore we go through the guidance, I wanted to note that year-over-year growth rates are on a constant currency basis. Also if on-premise restrictions are increased and/or reinstated in some of our larger markets, this could have a significant impact on our financial performance during that period. Additional risk factors include the impact of rising global inflation beyond that currently anticipated and a prolonged strike at our brewery near Montreal.\nFor 2022, we continue to expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth, high single-digit underlying income before income taxes growth and underlying free cash flow of $1 billion, plus or minus 10%.\nWe expect to continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures in areas, including materials and transportation costs, and expect those pressures to increase for the balance of the year. However, we intend to judiciously pull our multiple levers to help mitigate the impact.\nAs discussed on our fourth quarter call, we announced a 3% to 5% price increase early in 2022, which in the U.S. we took earlier than typical. Also, we have other levers to help offset inflation, including mix from premiumization and our cost savings and hedging programs.\nIn these unusually challenging times, we want to provide a bit more color on our quarterly outlook for the rest of the year. As Gavin mentioned, we have several headwinds and tailwinds that will impact our quarterly earnings phasing. As a result, we expect our second quarter underlying income before income taxes to be down between approximately 20% and 50% from the prior year period. We expect stronger relative year-over-year performance in the second half of the year, enabling us to reach our full year guidance.\nNow let me walk through those drivers. First, we are planning a double-digit increase in our year-over-year marketing spend in the second quarter, putting marketing investments to well above 2021 levels. Recall, in the second quarter of last year, we had lower relative spending when our Inventories were low due to the first quarter 2021 cybersecurity incident and severe Texas storm, and we were still experiencing on-premise restrictions across all of our major geographies. We did not begin [our spending] until the second half of last year, investing above 2019 levels.\nSecond, our inventory position in the U.S. heading into peak summer season is the best it's been since before the pandemic. And last year, at this time, it was the lowest it has been in years. While the fact that we won't be playing catch-up this year is taking a very positive development, it also means we don't expect our U.S. STWs to be as high as they were in the second quarter last year.\nThird, our ongoing strike at the Longueuil brewery and distribution centers or Montreal will have an impact on our second quarter results.\nAnd fourth, year-over-year top line comparisons will begin to get more difficult in the second quarter relative to the first quarter comparisons, particularly in the U.K., where the on-premise began to reopen in April 2021 with pent-up demand. However, these comparisons should ease in the fourth quarter given the renewed on-premise restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, particularly in the U.K. and Canada.\nIn terms of our other guidance metrics, we continue to expect underlying depreciation and amortization of approximately $750 million, plus or minus 5% reported, net interest expense of $265 million, plus or minus 5% and an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 24%.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reduce net debt and to return cash to shareholders. We are maintaining our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of below 3x by the end of 2022, as we had a strong desire to maintain and, in time, upgrade our investment-grade rating.\nWe repaid our $500 million 3.5% U.S. D note upon its maturity on May 1, 2022, using a combination of commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand.\nAlso during the first quarter, we paid approximately $14 million for 280,000 shares under our share repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors on February 17, 2022. As a reminder, this share repurchase program authorized the company to purchase up to an aggregate of $200 million of our Class B common stock through March 31, 2026, with repurchases primarily intended to offset annual employee equity award grants.\nIn closing, we remain confident in our strategy and pleased with our progress. These are dynamic and uncertain times, but what's clear is that we have built our business to manage through challenging times.\nOur demonstrated operational agility through the pandemic, our dramatic improvements to our financial flexibility, our successful cost savings program that has served to fuel targeted investments to support our core brands and key innovations have all further strengthened our business as we continue to drive toward our goal of sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth.\nAnd with that, we look forward to answering your questions.

Following prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements.

K. Hattersley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Molson Coors Beverage Company\n\nThanks, Greg. 2021 was a turbulent year all around the world for our industry and for our business. The pandemic ranged and received multiple times, but unfortunately, it surged in the last 6 weeks of the year. And with it came government restrictions value to bars and restaurants, most notably in Europe and Canada. That is our 2 biggest brands, each grew net sales revenue in the U.S., Americas and globally, an incredible feat given the fact that over the past few years, many folks have been at the belief that this whole segment was in a part of aspiring clients across the U.S. and Canada.\nWe finished the calendar year with a larger global above premium portfolio than ever before, with our hard seltzer portfolio growing at the fastest rate of any major beverage company in the United States. Very strong hard seltzer growth in Canada and standout beer innovations in the U.K. as well as in Central and Eastern Europe. We are moving to scale beyond the (inaudible) on the back of the fastest-growing energy drink in the United States for IRR, and we continue to invest in our future growth all around the world.\nFolks, in 2021, Molson Coors grew the top line for the first time in a decade. Top line growth is 1 of the core goals of our revitalization plan and a result our company has not been able to deliver it in a long time. Yes, we started missed our guidance on EBITDA as a result of the impact of the Omicron variant surge in the last 6 weeks of the quarter. But at the same, we've been very disciplined with cash within the business, improving our leverage ratio faster than we expected, and we chose not to cut the marketing investments that will help ensure the long-term health of our brands and our business. Overall, Molson Coors finished 2021 as a healthier business than we were at the end of 2019.\nNow as you'll recall in our third quarter call, we said that uncertainty as it pertains to potential surges in the coronavirus and/or its variants to varying degrees by market could have an impact on our financial performance. But unfortunately, that is exactly what happened. The on-premise in much of EMEA experienced increased restrictions beginning in the middle of the fourth quarter as the Omicron variant surged. In the U.K., the Christmas holiday period is one of the most important sales windows at the whole year. and due to government restrictions for pubs and restaurants and more cautious consumer behavior, we fell below 80% of 2019 net sales revenue.\nU.K. is our third largest global market by net sales revenue, and the on-premise accounted for 65% of our business there in 2021. So as was well established earlier in the pandemic, when that channel is restricted or shut down, it has a meaningful impact in our business, and we felt that in the fourth quarter. But we know from experience over the past 2 years of the pandemic that this has been temporary.\nWhen the on-premise channel has reopened and when consumers are comfortable reentering bars and restaurants, they came right back. And I'm proud to announce that we are ranked #1 in the U.K. Advantage Group survey, as an independent industry-wide survey on how the big on-premise national customers across the U.K. beer brand owners, and the results speak volumes about our hard working team.\nAdditionally, some of our U.S. suppliers had renewed challenges, providing materials like battle crowns at the tail end of the year, which had knock-on effects on our production. But this has certainly eased in the time since. We've taken matters into our own hands by increasing the number of suppliers we work with to deliver these kind of issues going forward.\nOne point I want to make clear, though, is that while pandemic-driven issues with freight availability in the global supply chain continue to challenge us in the fourth quarter, we made significant improvements with our distributor inventory in the U.S. We closed 2021 with about 700,000 more barrels of (inaudible) inventory than we did in 2020. And that progress puts us in a far better inventory position heading into 2022. And in fact, our out of stocks for core brands and packs are at their lowest levels since before the pandemic.\nToday, our top line is growing fast for the first time in 10 years. Our core brands are growing net sales revenue for the first time in years. Our portfolio is premiumizing to levels never before achieved. We are moving to scale beyond beer and are busy making tangible progress towards achieving the goals of our revitalization plan. We are set up for a strong 2022.\nNow I want to dig in a little deeper, starting with our core brands. For the past few years, you've heard us talk about things like segment share and brand health as leading indicators that Coors Light and Miller Lite remains strong foundations of our global business. And today, I'm very happy to tell you that each brand grew net sales revenue in the U.S. in 2021, Coors Light by 4.4% and Miller Lite by 7.6%. We also saw double-digit growth in our on-premise placements for Miller Lite versus last year. In Canada, Coors Light also reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter, while Miller Lite revenue was up double digits for the full year with acceleration in the fourth quarter.\nOur portfolio continues to premiumize. Our above premium net sales revenue has grown over 15% in 2021. The biggest driver of that premiumization was our growth in U.S. hard seltzers. Despite ending the year with only 1 nationally distributed hard seltzer brand, our portfolio grew triple digits over the course of 2021, and we generated the largest growth rate in this space among any of the major beverage suppliers per IRI. Today, we have 2 of the top 5 hard seltzer brands in the U.S. with Topo Chico Hot Seltzer and Vizzy, and we see more upside ahead.\nBut the out of hard seltzer to franchises, Vizzy is the only 1 that has existed for multiple years and has never lost hard seltzer share in a quarter. In 2022, that success is continuing with busy growing both industry and hard seltzer share. And while it's still early, we are very optimistic about the national launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer jumped to the fastest turning hard seltzer nationally, and we believe it can become a top 3 hard seltzer in the U.S. Per IRI, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer has improved industry share each week since its national launch. Even in markets where the Topo Chico mineral water is less known, we are seeing strong results. Per IRI, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer alone has already reached a 5 share of hard stale in 7 new markets since launch. And we're bringing new packs to the brand with bottles, Margarita Hard Seltzer and Ranch Water that is already driving results.\nOur 12 pack of Topo Chico Ranch Water is not only the fastest turning ranch water in Texas, it's the fastest turning in the United States. Our hard seltzer progress extends to Canada, where we achieved a 9 share in hard seltzers in less than 9 months. That was driven by both Vizzy and Seltzer, with both brands finishing the year in the top 10 had sales of brands in Canada.\nAbove premium beer continues to be a growth driver for us as well. In the U.S., Blue Moon Belgian White grew net sales revenue by high single digits in 2021 and saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Peroni earned double-digit growth in 2021, and our U.S. regional craft portfolio once again outpaced the category. And we are gaining total share of the craft segment in Canada as well, led by the strong performance of Brasseur de Montreal and (inaudible)\nWe also continue to premiumize our EMEA and APAC business. Madri Excepcional has continued to accelerate as the world beer category grows in the U.K. and in Ireland. As of today, it's now delivering the fourth highest rate of sale of all draft world liters per CGA. And in 2021, Prive became the fastest-growing premium 4% larger per CGA.\nWe are also bringing an exciting new innovation to market in the U.S. through an expanded agreement with the Coca-Cola Company. Simply Spike Lemonade will be a full flavor alcohol beverage inspired by the #1 overall juice brand, a growing billion-dollar brand and the second largest brand in Coke's portfolio. Simply can already be found in 1 out of every 2 American households, and the brand continues to grow. So we are very excited about this opportunity to shake up the full flavor alcohol beverage space as more legal age consumers look for bolder flavor.\nIn 2021, we put teeth behind our talk of becoming a total beverage company. Our Beyond Beer products are performing very well and helping to fuel our emerging growth business, which contributed approximately $800 million to 2021 net sales revenue, taking ahead of our $1 billion annual revenue target by 2023. ZOA has already proven to be a success with a lot of opportunities still ahead as we continue to expand distribution. In less than 10 months, it has gone from nonexistent to (inaudible) Latin America posted out 2021 with stellar performance, generating double-digit growth across this part of the business and (inaudible) in which we operate (inaudible) investing in our capabilities.\nThere are physical investments, which are, of course, (inaudible) turned on a new hard seltzer and spirits production line in Toronto. Our new state-of-the-art brewery is online in Montreal, and we're adding new calling and production capabilities in the U.K.\nAnd then there are the investments we are making behind our brands. We increased marketing behind our core brands and key innovations and to become much more effective with those dollars as we accelerated our digital marketing capabilities.\nFolks, over the past few years, we have laid the foundation for sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth at Molson Coors. Today, our core power brands are growing dollar sales. Today, more of our portfolio is in the above premium space than ever before. Today, we are (inaudible) today, we have stronger capabilities to drive future growth. And because of all of that, because of the foundation we have delayed over the past 2 years against great odds and in a historically challenging environment, we can give guidance that in 2022, most people expects to deliver highest top and bottom line growth in over a decade. We will continue to invest in our business to drive towards sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth.\nNow to give you greater details on that, I'd like to hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Joubert. Trace?\n\nTracey I. Joubert\n\nCFO, Molson Coors Brewing Company\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. As Gavin highlighted, 2021 was a year of tremendous progress against our revitalization plan. Despite the challenges that we and so many other companies face, we achieved our top line guidance of mid-single-digit growth for the year, delivered strong free cash flow, enabling us to further reduce our leverage ratio and return cash to shareholders. We continue to execute our revitalization plan, building a strong foundation for future growth. and we issued fiscal 2022 guidance that underscores that progress.\nBefore I take you through our quarterly, our full performance and our outlook, I would like to update on a couple of naming convention changes in our business unit reporting. This does not change our reported results for these segments and was done for the names better effect the geographies within the segment. As of December 31, 2021, our reporting statements are the Americas, formerly called North America and EMEA and APAC formally called Europe.\nNow let's discuss the fourth quarter. We delivered strong top line and EBITDA performance. While we benefited from cycling significant on-premise restrictions in the prior year, we were still impacted by the rapid emergence of the Omicron variant, offered an overall on-premise softness compared to the third quarter. In December, the U.S. on-premise net sales revenue was approximately 86% of December 2019 net sales revenue, down from third quarter levels of a approximately 88% (inaudible) approximately 60% of December 2019 net sales revenue, down from third quarter levels of approximately 80%. And the U.K. was below 80% after being close to 100% in the third quarter.\nConsolidated net sales revenue increased 13.7% driven by EMEA and APAC growth of 56.5% and Americas growth of 7.1%. Consolidated net sales revenue growth was driven by higher financial volume, positive global net pricing and favorable brand and channel mix due to premiumization and fewer on-premise restrictions versus the prior year. In fact, consolidated net sales revenue increased 4.3% compared to 2019.\nConsolidated financial volume increased 7.4% as we rebuild U.S. domestic inventories and group brand volumes 2.3%, driven by EMEA and APAC, Canada and Latin America. This was partially offset by lower U.S. economy brand volumes as a result of our economy SKU ratio and rationalization program.\nIn the U.S., we grew net sales revenue 6.3%, with the medtech shipments up 3.3%, reflecting our efforts to bold distributor inventories (inaudible) by disruptions in 2021. U.S. brand volumes declined 3.8%, but this was driven entirely by the economy portfolio which was down double digits, while our premium portfolio grew low single digits and the above premium portfolio was up double digits for the quarter.\n(inaudible), our net sales revenue increased 9.9% on strong brand volume growth of 6%, while Latin America net sales revenue increased 15.9% on brand volume growth of 12.4%. EMEA and APAC net sales revenue grew 56.5%, driven largely by Western Europe, but also growth in Central and Eastern Europe. Strength in our core brands and new innovations like Madri led to double-digit growth in above premium and premium volume, partially offset by double-digit declines in economy.\nNet sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.8%, driven by global net pricing growth and positive brand and channel mix with premiumization delivered across both business units. And inflation, including higher input and transportation costs and mix impact from premiumization. So we benefited from volume leverage due to higher production volumes and continued progress on our cost savings program.\nUnderlying MG&A in the quarter increased 2.4% as we continue to invest across both business units, while G&A was flat. As planned, we increased margins above the fourth quarter in both 2020 and 2019, providing strong commercial support behind our brands as 2022.\nEBITDA increased 21.9%. For full year consolidated net sales revenue increased 4.7%, with Americas up to 2% and EMEA and APAC, up 19.6%. Top line growth was driven by global net pricing, favorable brand and channel mix from premiumization and fewer on-premise restrictions and EMEA and APAC volume growth. This was partially offset by lower financial volumes in the Americas.\nConsolidated financial volumes declined 0.5%, while brand volumes declined 1.7%. Americas brand volumes declined 3.2% as a result of the economy deprioritization, which began in the second quarter of 2021 and rationalization program, which was announced last July.\nEMEA and APAC brand volumes were up 3%. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew 3.8% due to global net pricing growth and favorable sales mix. In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis was up 4.4% for the year, driven by net pricing growth and the succession of both premium products, including (inaudible) Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, (inaudible) family and Peroni.\nUnderlying cost per hectoliter increased 6.9%, driven by cost inflation, including higher input and transportation costs, mix impact from premiumization and volume deleverage. However, with the benefit of our robust hedging and cost savings programs, we were able to mitigate some of the inflationary pressure.\nUnderlying MG&A increased 2.9%, largely due to higher marketing investments versus 2020. In the second half of 2021, we began to progressively increase marketing spend with the redemption of more sports and live events. MG&A increases were also driven by lapping profited cost mitigation actions in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and were partially offset by our cost savings program.\nIn 2021, we delivered approximately (inaudible) G&A and cost of goods sold in our 3-year $600 million cost savings program. Over the 2020 through 2021 period, we have delivered an aggregate $490 million, taking us well on track to meet our $600 million savings by the end of 2022. As a result of these factors, underlying EBITDA decreased 3.5%. This was slightly (inaudible) and was driven by the on-premise (inaudible).\nHowever, underlying net income before income taxes was approximately flat for the year (inaudible) 5.6% underlying EPS growth compared to the prior year. Underlying free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the year, a decrease of $183 million from the prior year. This decline can be wholly attributed to the repayment of approximately $100 million of taxes related to various government-sponsored deferral programs related to the pandemic, which benefited the prior year free cash flow of (inaudible) creating a net $50 million on our 2021 free cash flow.\n(inaudible) capital movements were favorable to the prior year. Capital expenditures paid were $523 million this year, down from $575 million in 2020 and focus capability programs such as the previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project, our new Montreal Brewery (inaudible) our hard seltzer capacity in Canada and the U.K.\nWe have continued to make great progress strengthening the balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility. $1 billion in 2020 (inaudible) net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio is better than our guidance of approximately 3.25x as of the end of December 2020. And (inaudible) in 2016 at the time of the MillerCoors acquisition. We ended the year with strong borrowing capacity with no borrowings outlook, which calls for both top and bottom line growth in over a decade.\nBefore we go through the guidance, I wanted to note that year-over-year growth rates are in constant uncertainty (inaudible) as it pertains to the coronavirus and its variance remains to on-premise reflections are increased and/or reinstated in some of our larger markets. This could have a significant impact on our financial performance during that period.\nFor 2022, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth. We expect to deliver high single-digit underlying income before income taxes growth and underlying free cash flow of $1 billion plus or minus 10%. This guidance implies that we will ship to consumption in the U.S. for the year.\nIn terms of phasing, recall that we will start lapping the economies to deprioritization and rationalization in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, we expect to face continued inflationary pressures, including transportation and material to have levers to offset inflation, including pricing, mix from premiumization and our cost savings and hedging program. These headwinds are expected to continue to pressure gross margin but have been built into our guidance. And we expect to continue to invest behind our core brands and key innovations, which entails increasing the level of marketing investment from the prior year.\nGiven the on-premise restrictions in the first half of 2021 we expect greater year-over-year increases in marketing spend in the first half of 2022. We also intend to invest behind our capabilities with cash (inaudible) debt levels. (inaudible) metrics include underlying depreciation is $750 million, plus or minus 5%, reported net interest expense of $265 million, plus or minus 5%, and an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 24%.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reduce net debt and to return cash to shareholders. We are maintaining our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of below 3x by the end of 2022, and we have a strong investment-grade rating.\nAnd on February 22, 2022, the Board declared a dividend of $0.58 per share. Also on February 17, 2022, the Board directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the company to intended to (inaudible)\nIn closing, (inaudible) but it did not deter us from executing our plan. The progress we have made has laid a strong foundation to achieve our goals of sustainable long-term line growth and our 2022 are on the right part. (inaudible) Operator?"

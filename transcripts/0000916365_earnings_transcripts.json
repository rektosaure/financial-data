[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without written authorization of Tractor Supply Company. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mary Winn Pilkington, Senior Vice President of Investor and Public Relations for Tractor Supply Company.

And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal Lawton.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before getting into our results, I want to thank our more than 52,000 Tractor Supply team members. Their commitment, hard work and passion for Life Out Here continue to set us apart. By delivering legendary service they build the trust and loyalty that defined our brand, and their dedication to our lifestyle remains the foundation of our leadership in rural retail.\nThe Tractor Supply team delivered a strong third quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by ongoing share gains in our consumable, usable and edible businesses, agile execution through an extended summer season, and healthy transaction growth that was supported by our consistent focus on value and service. Our view is that our third quarter results largely mirrored the broader U.S. consumer environment augmented by some share gain. We saw a strong start to the quarter with spending trends moderating into September. This pattern aligned with what we observed across the retail landscape and, in our case, was amplified by 2 key dynamics. First, the tailwind of an extended spring in July; and second, the headwinds of an unseasonably warm weather in September and the absence of emergency response.\nSo let's start with a few top line sales highlights from the quarter. First off, we grew net sales 7.2% to a third quarter record of $3.72 billion. Comparable store sales increased 3.9%, driven by a balance of transaction growth of 2.7% and average ticket growth of 1.2%. And importantly, we had positive comps in all 3 months, positive comps in 11 weeks, a flat comp in 1 and negative comps in only 1 week. We are particularly pleased to extend our track record of comp transaction growth, a hallmark of Tractor Supply and a strong signal of the health and engagement of our customer base.\nOur customers remain loyal and connected to their lifestyle, continuing to shop with us across categories and channels. And so let's turn to some customer engagement metrics, which remained a clear strength in the quarter.\nFirst, customer satisfaction remains strong with scores continuing their positive trajectory, marking a record 17 quarters of consecutive improvement. Additionally, we achieved record Q3 highs across some key customer metrics, including total customer count, Neighbor's Club membership, reactivated customers and retention rates. Neighbor's Club continues to be a powerful differentiator and represents over 80% of our sales. We saw gains in member retention and spend per member, and our Home Count Heroes program continues to attract new customers. We're also making progress in how we serve customers using data. With the implementation of our new customer data platform last year, our team is now able to better personalize offers and messaging, helping us deliver more relevant and engaging experiences across channels.\nNow let's shift to category performance in the third quarter. In line with recent quarters, the consumer remained discerning in their spending with categories that offer newness, strong value and needs-based continuing to outperform. Our comp sales growth was driven by strong seasonal performance in spring and summer products, along with continued momentum in our core year-round categories. As we moved from the second quarter into the third, seasonal categories strengthened meaningfully. After a more modest first half, we benefited from the bathtub effect of the extended summer season. We believe this was about a 50- to 60-basis-point contribution to the third quarter that would have historically been in the first half.\nAs it relates to seasonal, the team did a great job capitalizing on the elongated summer season, whether through strategically positioned inventory, enhanced financing offers or targeted labor investments, across the company, our merchants, to our store teams, to our supply chain, the organization leaned in to capture every single sales opportunity. And a great example of that execution was in our tractors and riders category, which delivered another strong quarter. Our industry-leading lineup of zero-turn mowers, combined with the disciplined inventory management and effective merchandising, continue to resonate with customers and drove share gains in this category in the quarter.\nAdditionally, other categories in seasonal that saw standout results were lawn and garden, sprayers and chemicals and power equipment parts and accessories. In our hallmark area of C.U.E., we saw stronger than average growth in livestock, [indiscernible], poultry feed and supplies and wildlife supplies. And in wildlife supplies, we continue to expand our position as a destination for outdoor enthusiasts across gun safes, deer corn, feeders, hunting [indiscernible], attracted, trail cameras and more. Our customers are responding to the depth of the inventory and the newness that we're bringing into the category including the launch of the Field & Stream brand. We now have nearly 50 SKUs in this brand available in store and online with a robust pipeline and development, and this launch strengthens our position as the destination for the Out Here lifestyle.\nIn discretionary and weather-dependent categories, particularly those in the fall season, such as recreational vehicles, grilling, safes and generators, sales continued to lag, reflecting both the cautious big ticket consumer and the absence of storm-related activity this year. As it relates to big ticket, overall, the strength in tractors and riders offset the softness I just mentioned in discretionary and emergency response categories, resulting in essentially a flat comp performance for the quarter. And finally, in companion animal, trends remained stable, but below company averages. The consumables business remains flattish, with seasonal strength in animal health, and we have seen some sequential improvement in pet supplies and equipment as well.\nWe also continue to execute well across our strategic initiatives and operational priorities. Digital sales grew at a low double-digit rate, representing a notable sequential improvement from the second quarter. Nearly 80% of online orders were fulfilled by our stores, highlighting the strength of our local network and store base. Same-day delivery and deliver from store outperformed, reinforcing the convenience and reliability of our model and the value of the final mile capabilities that we're building out.\nPetsense by Tractor Supply marked its 20th anniversary and congratulations to that team, and it highlights the differentiated pet specialty model out in rural America. Our distribution centers delivered another strong quarter of productivity gains, supported by disciplined execution and efficient inventory flow across the network. This execution helped ensure we remained in stock on the product our customers count on, particularly with the extended seasonal demand.\nTurning to pet pharmacy. We continue to see steady growth in orders and customer adoption. Each week, we're seeing an increase in Neighbor's Club subscriptions of prescription and over-the-counter products, leveraging our Allivet acquisition. Our customers continue to engage with our suite of pet services, which also includes pet washes and vet clinics.\nOn the real estate front, we remain disciplined and confident in our growth strategy. We opened 29 new Tractor Supply stores in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 68. New store productivity continues to perform very well. Our pipeline of 2026 and into 2027 remains robust with significant runway for low-risk, value-creating organic growth ahead.\nWe also continue to invest in our existing store fleet. We now have 55% of our chain in the Project Fusion layout and nearly 700 garden centers. These are capital investments that provide a multiyear runway for growth and extend the terminal value of our stores. They help us be more relevant to both our core customers and our new customers, allowing us to garner a greater share of their spending and be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle.\nFinally, we're making solid progress on advancing our Life Out Here strategic initiatives with a focus on direct sales in final mile. These initiatives strengthen our foundation for long-term growth and relevancy to our customers.\nTo summarize, the third quarter demonstrated the strength and consistency of our model, healthy customer engagement, strong execution and continued progress on our Life Out Here strategy. As we look ahead, we believe it is appropriate and timely to narrow our fiscal 2025 guidance. This guidance reflects our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain excited about our strategy and our ability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt to provide more detail on our performance and outlook.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Hal highlighted, our third quarter top line performance aligned with our expectation. Each period of the quarter delivered positive results, supported by consistent transaction growth throughout. Sustained growth in transactions remains a hallmark of Tractor Supply and a key indicator of the health of our business model. In addition, all geographic regions across the chain delivered positive comparable sales for the quarter. These results underscore the broad-based nature of our performance and the consistency we are seeing in the business. This was especially evident in the performance of our C.U.E. categories, which outperformed the chain average and had mid-single-digit comparable sales growth every month of the quarter.\nWhile the early part of the quarter benefited from the extended spring selling season, the later portion was pressured by lingering summer heat and dry conditions with no meaningful shift to fall weather.\nAs far as emergency response sales, while we did not receive a significant year-over-year sales lift from emergency response last year, we did have a hurricane event in 2024 that provided some benefit to sales. This year, we had no emergency weather-related activity, which represented a modest headwind to our third quarter comparisons.\nLet me add a few additional comments on our comp sales to complement Hal's remarks. The transition from price deflation to modest inflation year-over-year was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Average ticket increased 1.2%, driven principally by higher average unit retail. This was primarily the result of a higher, but stable commodity cost environment and, to a lesser extent, selective price adjustments as higher product costs flow through our supply chain.\nMoving down our income statement. Our gross margin increased 15 basis points to 37.4%, in line with our expectations. This performance reflects the continued discipline of our merchant team in managing product costs and consistent execution of our everyday low price strategy. These benefits more than offset the anticipated pressure from tariff costs and higher transportation costs as we lapped last year's benefit from the opening of a new distribution center along with the modest cost increase to support our strategic investment and final mile delivery.\nWe remain very pleased with our ability to expand gross margin in this environment, which speaks to the strength of our cost management initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, were $1.05 billion, up 8.4% from last year. As a percent of net sales, SG&A deleveraged 29 basis points to 28.1%. This outcome was in line with our expectations and reflects a few puts and takes. They were primarily 3 drivers of the deleverage. First, the planned strategic investments in our business to launch initiatives such as direct sales; second, higher incentive compensation from stronger performance, primarily at the store level and the lap from last year's lower accruals; and then third, a lower benefit year-over-year from our sale-leaseback strategy. These factors were partially offset by ongoing productivity initiatives and leverage and fixed costs from the stronger sales performance.\nImportantly, within gross margin and SG&A, we view our investment spending as critical to supporting our strategic priorities and long-term growth while continuing to balance expense discipline with the opportunities ahead.\nOur effective tax rate decreased to 21.0% from 22.3% in the third quarter last year, largely due to the timing of planned tax strategies for the purchase of federal tax credits, which we expect to normalize over the full year. On a year-to-date basis, our effective tax rate is 22.3%, just 10 basis points higher than last year's rate.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.49, up from $0.45 in the prior year. Our inventory position remains in excellent shape. Our average store inventory is up a modest 3.4%, reflecting healthy sell-through and strong inventory management by the team. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $600 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs we look ahead, we're focused on finishing the year with the same discipline and agility that have guided our results year-to-date. The fourth quarter carries typical seasonal variability, but we're confident in our ability to respond quickly to changing conditions and deliver within our outlook range.\nFor the fourth quarter, we anticipate comparable store sales growth in the range of 1% to 5%, reflecting a wider set of possible outcomes given the current consumer environment. And keep in mind, winter weather is often the primary driver of our fourth quarter business, more so than the holidays and the related gift buying. As a result of this outlook, we are narrowing our fiscal 2025 guidance range. We now expect net sales growth of 4.6% to 5.6%, comparable store sales growth of 1.4% to 2.4%, operating margin between 9.5% and 9.7% and diluted EPS in the range of $2.06 to $2.13.\nShifting further out, while we are not giving formal guidance for 2026, and with a caveat that we are still in the planning process and the macro environment can change rapidly, I thought it would be helpful to make a few comments about how we are thinking about next year.\nAs we look to 2026, we expect to open 100 new stores compared to 90 this year. This increase reflects our continued confidence in the strength of our new store economics and the long-term growth potential of our model. We anticipate a consistent pace of openings throughout the year. For 2026, we are optimistic about maintaining the step-up in comps that we are forecasting for the second half of this year. We expect transactions to remain a strength, with average ticket staying positive and the early benefits of our strategic investments contributing to that momentum. This level of comp sales growth should also support progress in our operating margin rate. To that end, we would anticipate fiscal 2026 to be a more normalized year as it relates to our investment levels and the corresponding pressure on operating margin.\nMargin rate expanding proportionately as comp sales growth increases beyond that level.\nStepping back, with our peak capital investment cycle as a percent of sales now behind us, we believe 2026 will reflect continued P&L normalization. This progress positions us to deliver solid sales growth with the margin improvement opportunity in line [indiscernible]\nLife Out Here strategy. For the balance of the year, our priority remains on being a dependable supplier, delivering compelling value and providing more meaningful in-store and online experiences. Let me share some of the key in-store and merchandising activities that we have planned. We remain excited about the continued momentum of our Hometown Heroes program, which is part of our Neighbor's Club benefits for military service members, veterans and first responders.\nThis year in the weeks leading up to veterans [indiscernible] to connect with our communities in very special ways from Touch a Truck events to Marathon [indiscernible] for kids to thank you to our hometown heroes and honor wall. These types of events create a lot of energy and excitement for stores. And if you get a chance, it's a great day to be in them.\nThe winter and holiday season always create [indiscernible]. It's a sense of fun and excitement across our business as our teams showcase the best in Tractor Supply for our company leaning into that responsibility with depth of inventory, the right price and fresh and trusted brands that reinforce our relevance.\nWhile holiday gets the spotlight, it's winter readiness that drives the heart of our business and where we consistently show up for our customers when they need us most. And once again, our now famous [indiscernible] holiday restrictors capturing customer attention and social [indiscernible] great price. And this year's tool to event brings outstanding value to our customers with leading brands and exclusive TSC offerings in power tools, accessories and storage.\nThis event highlights us as a gifting destination for the homesteader lifestyle. Our holiday sets always bring energy and excitement to our stores. But as I said, what truly drives our business in the fourth quarter is the weather. And when winter weather arrives, our customers know they can depend on Tractor Supply. From localization to direct sales to pet and animal Rx to Final Mile, exclusive and private brands and retail media, the team is fully engaged in executing detailed road maps that will drive growth and long-term value creation.\nTo close, we operate in a large, attractive market that rewards consistency, connection and authenticity to a lifestyle. Our investments in our new store base, in our existing stores, in our technology, in our supply chain and in our talent are strengthening our competitive advantage and enabling us to consistently gain share. Combined with strong new store returns, ongoing rural migration and disciplined expense management, we believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open up the call for questions."

    "content": "Half Year 2025 Tesco PLC Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2025 Tesco PLC Earnings Call\n\nTSCOLONDONOCT 2, 4:00 AM\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome. I'm in Welling with Imran to share an update on our performance over the first half of the year as well as the progress we are making to unlock our longer-term growth opportunities.\nI'm pleased with the progress we've made across the half. Our strong momentum is once again down to the brilliant work our colleagues do day in, day out to put our customers first. I'd like to start today by saying a huge thank you to all of them. In the face of increased competitive intensity and additional taxes, we took decisive action to further invest in delivering the best possible value, quality and service. Our actions have resonated with customers. Satisfaction has increased. And consequentially, we have continued to grow market share, in fact, even more share than we anticipated.\nAlongside strengthening our competitive position, we have continued to invest in both our core business and long-term growth opportunities, enabled by our Save to Invest program. The strong response from customers to the improvements in our offer is reflected in our financial performance, which Imran will take us through in more detail shortly. To summarize, our group sales grew 5.1% with growth in all operating segments and our adjusted operating profit increased by 1.6%.\nThough we are pleased with our performance so far, we remain focused on delivering the best possible value for our customers as they start to get ready for Christmas. Building customer trust and satisfaction is at the very heart of everything we do. Our overall brand perception score has increased year-on-year and remains well ahead of the competitor average. We outperformed peers across the board with continued gains in satisfaction, value and quality. Our Net Promoter Score has also moved forward during the half and is now at its highest level in 6 years.\nOur ongoing investment in value, quality and service continues to resonate with customers. In the U.K., we have grown volume and have consistently seen market share gains for over 2 years. with our share now over 28%. Meanwhile, in Ireland, we have consolidated 3 years of strong gains. Household budgets remain tight, and we understand how important value remains to customers. We've continued to invest in price, improving our position relative to the rest of the market with a particular focus on the products that matter most to customers.\nThrough a combination of Aldi Price Match, low everyday prices and Clubcard prices, our value proposition remains unrivaled, and we have seen switching gains from the majority of our key competitors. Ensuring customers get the best possible value by shopping at Tesco isn't just about price, and we are passionate about raising the bar in quality and product innovation across our ranges. This half, we launched more than 470 new products in the U.K. with 200 of those being in Finest. Highlights include an improved Finest BBQ range and delicious new launches like iced coffee concentrate and Finest Gelato. As the price of dining out continues to rise faster than the price of dining in, customers are increasingly turning to our Finest ranges to treat themselves.\nNow in their third year of double-digit growth, Finest sales have grown over 16% year-on-year. While Finest has again been a standout performer, we continue to broaden and deepen our quality offering across all tiers, including relaunching our meal deals sushi range and improving welfare standards on our core fresh chicken ranges. Our commitment to providing great quality for all customers is being recognized externally too. And in June, we were awarded Retailer of the Year at the Free From Food Awards.\nClubcard allows us to understand our customers even better and the insights it provides help power our business. Clubcard engagement is growing with penetration around 85% across the group. As we continue to celebrate 30 years of Clubcard, we have been sharing new and exciting rewards with customers, including cinema tickets for GBP 2.50 in Clubcard vouchers with Cineworld and GBP 10 off with a range of Days Out partners. Customers can now earn Clubcard points when they charge their cars too. Our new partnership with Pod awards points for charging at more than 2,500 EV points across our estate.\nOur colleagues are central to everything we do and the service they provide shapes the experience customers have. In March, we announced an above-inflation pay increase of 5.2% for our colleagues in stores. This latest investment, the equivalent of GBP 180 million builds on significant investment in pay and benefits we've made in recent years. I'm proud to say that more than 64,000 colleagues, mainly those working in stores and distribution centers are currently participating in our Save As You Earn share schemes.\nColleague safety and well-being is our top priority. And all our U.K. colleagues have now free access to a personal safety app that can track their journeys and help them raise the alarm if they don't feel safe. This is part of a much broader offer, which includes a virtual GP service, accessed by many of our colleagues and their families. It's important that everyone feels welcome and can thrive at Tesco. And I'm proud that we have been listed as one of the Times top 50 employers for gender equality for the fifth consecutive year.\nWe're committed to delivering for all of our stakeholders. And throughout the half, we've taken further steps to support our communities, the environment and our suppliers. Our Fruit & Veg for Schools initiative has already provided more than 10.8 million portions of fruit and veg. And this year, we've extended the scheme to even more schools. We introduced fruit and veg planters made from recycled soft plastics too, so that people can try their hand at growing their own projects.\nWe also launched our new campaign to help the nation get more of its 5 a day. Across stores and online, we've incentivized healthy choices through Clubcard challenges on fruit and veg with recipe Inspiration too. We're working hard to make the food system more sustainable and making good progress on our Planet Plan. Supporting our commitment to procure more electricity through our power purchase agreements, we've agreed a new deal with EDF for Hare Craig wind farm in Scotland, which will start generating renewable electricity in 2028.\nStrong partnerships with our suppliers are fundamental to our supply chain and so our ability to serve customers and communities. To help farmers achieve our shared goals, we have rolled out an additional sustainability-linked incentive for more than 400 farmers in our sustainable farming groups. As the biggest customer of British agriculture, we believe we can play a key role in supporting the long-term economic and environmental sustainability of U.K. farming.\nWe started the year facing even greater uncertainty than normal, but we were confident that by putting customers first, we could deliver for all of our stakeholders. We're pleased with the customer response to our decisive action. And this, combined with strong cost control and the benefit of good weather has allowed us to upgrade our guidance for the year.\nImran will now cover this as part of his financial review before I return to update you on our strategic progress. Over to you, Imran.\n\nImran Nawaz\n\nCFO & Director\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance across the half. As Ken highlighted, we saw a better-than-expected response to the investments we made to our customer offer. This translated into strong sales growth, operating profit growth and continued cash generation.\nGroup sales grew by 5.1% at constant exchange rates. This included a 4.3% increase in like-for-like sales with continued volume growth. Group adjusted operating profit increased by 1.6% with growth in sales volumes alongside progress on our Save to Invest program, offsetting operating cost inflation and investments across value, quality and service. Our cash delivery was strong with GBP 1.3 billion of free cash flow in the half. Net debt was GBP 9.88 billion at the end of the half, an increase of GBP 430 million versus year-end. As a reminder, the year-end figure included around GBP 700 million of proceeds from the sale of our banking operations, which we started to return during this period.\nAround half of these proceeds have now been returned as part of our total GBP 1.45 billion buyback program this year. Headline earnings per share increased 6.8% year-on-year to 15.43p. We have proposed an interim dividend of 4.8p per ordinary share. This is in line with our policy of setting the interim dividend at 35% of the prior year total dividend. As you will have seen in our release this morning, following changes to our Group Executive Committee during this period, Booker is now reported as a separate operating segment. Following its disposal last year, our banking business continues to be presented as a discontinued operation.\nMy review this morning is on a continuing basis. Group sales for the half were GBP 33.1 billion. Our U.K. and Ireland segment delivered total sales growth of 5.6%, continuing its strong momentum. Booker total sales increased by 2.4%, with strong performances in core retail and catering offsetting the continued decline in the tobacco market. In Central Europe, sales grew by 5% with growth across all our countries amid regulatory and competitive pressures.\nGroup adjusted operating profit increased 1.6%, driven primarily by strong trading performances in the U.K. and Ireland. Over the next few slides, I will cover the performance of each market in more detail, starting with sales before moving on to profit. In the U.K., we delivered total sales growth of 5.6%, including like-for-like sales growth of 4.9% with continued market share gains. Food like-for-like sales grew by 5.7% with volume growth supported by ongoing investments in our customer offer as well as the benefit of good weather.\nWe saw strong growth across many categories, but Finest was once again a standout with sales up 16%. Our clothing sales were also particularly strong, up 7.8%, driven by the performance of our new ranges, which really resonated with customers as they enjoyed a great summer. We grew sales and outperformed the market in all U.K. channels. Our large store like-for-like sales grew by 4.5%, supported by continuing investments in price and service as well as our market-leading availability.\nConvenience like-for-like sales, which include both Tesco Express and One Stop grew 1.4%. Within this, the performance of our Express stores has been particularly good with over 70 basis points of market share gains. Our U.K. online sales grew by 11.4%, mainly driven by volume growth. We saw market share gains of 112 basis points with share now at 36.9%. We increased our online capacity, adding over 70,000 weekly delivery slots. The number of Delivery Saver subscriptions also increased, growing to 788,000.\nWe extended the rollout of Whoosh, our rapid delivery service with U.K. household coverage now at over 70%. With increases in both active customers and basket size, Whoosh delivered a 2 percentage point contribution to total online growth. Leveraging our existing asset base, Whoosh has now become an important part of our mission to serve customers wherever, whenever and however they want to be served.\nIn Ireland, like-for-like sales grew by 4.8%, with volume growth supported by the continued rollout of our store renewal program. Total sales were up 6.5% with a 1.3 percentage point contribution from new stores. Food sales grew by 5.1% as we continue to invest in product quality and innovation. Fresh sales were up 6.3% and sales of our Finest ranges grew by 13%. Nonfood sales were down 1.8%, which includes a 3.8 percentage point impact from the transition to a commission model for toys with The Entertainer. Excluding this impact of toys, nonfood sales were up 2%.\nBooker like-for-like sales increased by 1.7% with strong growth in core retail and catering offsetting continued tobacco decline. Our core retail like-for-like sales grew by 4.1% with particularly strong growth in our Premier symbol brand. In total, Booker added 275 net new retail partners in the half.\nCore catering saw like-for-like sales growth of 5.7% with volume growth supported by a weather benefit. We continue to invest in price competitiveness and saw a further increase in customer satisfaction.\nBest Foods Logistics like-for-like sales grew 1.3% despite ongoing weakness in parts of the fast food market it serves. In Central Europe, like-for-like sales grew by 3.4% with growth in all countries despite competitive and economic pressures. Food like-for-like sales grew by 4%, with fresh food up 7%. Our ongoing targeted price investments enabled us to remain competitive and contributed to an increase in our Net Promoter Score.\nNonfood like-for-like was down 0.8% with volumes challenged by subdued consumer confidence. We saw growth in all channels in the region with particularly good performance in our convenience and online channels.\nI'll now move to our profit performance. Group adjusted operating profit was GBP 1.67 billion, which represents a 1.6% increase on last year at constant rates. Our group adjusted operating margin was 4.6%, slightly lower than last year. Within this, U.K. and Ireland adjusted operating profits grew by 2.1% to GBP 1.47 billion. We delivered a strong trading performance, which combined with continued delivery of our Save to Invest program, more than offset investments in our customer offer and the ongoing cost inflation, which includes the increased national insurance contributions and the new EPR levy recognized in the half.\nThe U.K. and Ireland segment also includes operating profit from our insurance and money services business, which increased by GBP 6 million to GBP 100 million. Booker reported adjusted operating profit of GBP 162 million, growing 0.6% year-on-year. A good weather tailwind and cost efficiencies from our Save to Invest program helped mitigate significant industry-wide operating cost pressures, including the EPR levy. I am pleased with the contribution Booker makes to the group and see further opportunity for growth in the years to come. Central Europe adjusted operating profit was GBP 44 million, down GBP 5 million. This reflects targeted price investments to counter competitive pressures together with lower rental income following the sale of some of our shopping malls last year.\nThis slide details the 2 main reasons for the GBP 72 million reduction in statutory profit. First, we have higher adjusting items of GBP 71 million versus GBP 37 million last year. This includes GBP 20 million restructuring and property costs and GBP 13 million of bank separation costs in addition to the ongoing amortization of acquired intangibles, mainly related to the Booker merger.\nSecond, net finance costs are higher. This is mainly due to the movement in fair value remeasurements of financial instruments as a result of the decrease in long-term inflation expectations.\nMoving now to our cash flow, which remains strong. We delivered GBP 1.3 billion of free cash flow with cash generated from operations increasing GBP 283 million year-on-year. While we normally see a working capital inflow in the first half at GBP 408 million, we saw a higher inflow than last year, reflecting the strong trading performance in the half. Our cash CapEx was GBP 0.7 billion in the half versus GBP 0.6 billion in the prior year, reflecting a more even shape to this year's investments. Tax paid was GBP 50 million higher, reflecting the end of historical tax deductions and phasing of tax payments.\nDividends received increased GBP 50 million versus the prior year, reflecting income received from IMS. Let's now turn to the balance sheet, which also remains strong. Net debt was 9.88 billion, an increase of GBP 430 million from the year-end. The year-end balance included GBP 700 million of disposal proceeds related to the sale of our banking operations, and we have since returned around half of this. Together with the payment of our full year dividend and ongoing capital return, this additional buyback more than offset the benefit of our very strong free cash flow. Our net debt-EBITDA ratio was unchanged from the year-end at 2x, partially benefiting from the disposal proceeds we will have returned by year-end. Our fixed charge cover was 4.3x at the end of the half compared to 4.2x at year-end.\nDuring the half and alongside the scheme's trustees, we agreed the triennial funding valuation for our principal defined benefit pension scheme. On a technical provisions basis, the funding position of the scheme remains in surplus, and it was therefore agreed with the trustees that no pension contributions would be required from the group. We continue to invest in our business with capital expenditure of GBP 667 million in the first half. We are prioritizing investment in high-returning areas such as automation and the development of our digital platforms.\nIn the summer, we opened the semi-automated fresh food distribution center in Aylesford, and we have continued to deliver wider automation initiatives across the group. This represents ongoing investment to ensure we are fighting fit for the future. We're also investing in our core estate, which in the half included 112 store refreshes. We expect total CapEx this year of around GBP 1.5 billion.\nIn April, we provided guidance, which allowed us to take decisive action and invest in every aspect of our shopping trip, following an increase in the competitive intensity in the U.K. Competitive intensity remains elevated, and we are committed to doing everything we can to deliver great value, great quality and great service for our customers. However, a better-than-expected customer response to our actions, strong cost control and the benefit of good weather have helped mitigate the impact of our investments in the first half. We now expect full year '25/'26 group adjusted operating profit of between GBP 2.9 billion and GBP 3.1 billion, an increase from the previous range of between GBP 2.7 billion and GBP 3 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow within our medium-term range of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion.\nBefore handing back to Ken to talk us through the strategic progress, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our longer-term momentum. We set our multiyear framework in 2021, and it continues to guide our approach to creating sustainable long-term value for every Tesco stakeholder. Delivery against our framework has been strong, and I'm pleased with our progress over the past 4.5 years.\nOur customer-focused and disciplined approach has delivered free cash flow ahead of our expectations. We have continued to invest in our business and make strong progress on our long-term opportunities. We ended the second half with strong momentum, which is built on our long-term commitment to investing in our customer offer. This has been reflected in our consistent delivery against our multiyear performance framework and strong consistent earnings growth and cash generation. I will now hand back to Ken to talk us through our strategic progress.\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Imran. Our strategic priorities continue to guide our approach to differentiating ourselves in a very competitive landscape. Each week, customers benefit from exceptional value through Aldi Price Match, Low Everyday Prices and of course, Clubcard prices. This winning proposition has supported an improvement in our price position against the market.\nAt the same time, we're driving innovation and enhancing our product ranges. These improvements are being recognized by customers with our quality perception making significant gains over the last 5 years. The strength of our Save to Invest program on track to deliver GBP 500 million of savings this year underpins our ability to invest, innovate and mitigate the effects of inflation. We have continued to improve and expand our store estate, opening 38 new stores and refreshing 112. As demand and our store estate grows, we're committed to ensuring our distribution network remains fit for the future.\nIn the first half, we opened a new semi-automated fresh food distribution center in Aylesford. And in July, we also announced a major investment into a new site at DP World London Gateway, which we expect to open in 2029. Online performance remains strong, and we have seen further growth in market share and customer satisfaction. We've increased our capacity, adding vans and more delivery slots for customers to choose from.\nTesco Whoosh, our rapid delivery service, continues to grow at a double-digit rate. Orders are up nearly 50% year-on-year with an increased number of active customers. Whoosh is now in over 1,600 stores across the U.K., and we've also launched in Ireland during the half. The recent launch of F&F online means more customers can access a much fuller range of clothing. Early performance has been encouraging with over 3 million sites visits per month so far.\nWe are introducing the platform in planned stages, learning and adapting as we go to ensure we offer the best possible online experience. Meanwhile, with over 600,000 products now available, Tesco Marketplace further enhances our online product offer. Every one of our customers is different, and we're investing in our digital capabilities to engage with them in a more relevant way. We have partnered with Adobe to build our capability and help power our one-to-one interactions with customers.\nIn the early stages, this includes close to real-time personalized e-mails with offers and recipe inspiration based on their preferences and shopping habits. As we build our capability, customers can hope to see a lot more. We have also sent tailored digital coupons to over 10 million customers and further enhanced our Clubcard challenges, which are now in their 10th round.\nIn addition to increasingly personalizing our core offer, we are looking to meet even more customer needs wherever, whenever and however they want to be served. In partnership with Aviva, we launched Tesco Life Insurance, offering customers cover at Clubcard prices with great rewards included. Customers can also access complementary health and well-being services with the Aviva Digicare+ app.\nTesco Mobile is one of the U.K.'s most trusted mobile networks and was voted Uswitch Best Mobile Network for Customer Service for the fourth year running. Our mobile customers benefit from exclusive Clubcard offers and no robbing fees for our 48 home-from-home destinations. In addition, F&F Home launched last year and continues to go from strength to strength. Designed by our in-house team, our expanded home range offers timeless designs at great prices.\nRetail Media is an exciting growth opportunity for us, and we've extended our reach across channels and suppliers in the first half. We were delighted to win Retail Media Network of the Year at the Retail MediaX Awards in May and to have been shortlisted for 8 of the upcoming MediaWeek awards. We've enhanced our Tesco Media & Insights offer, adding new features so suppliers and agencies can better manage their campaigns through our Sphere platform.\nOur mix of suppliers has expanded too. And by building tailored products to suit brands of all sizes, we have seen significant growth in small brand advertising. Over 550 new media screens were rolled out across our Express convenience stores, and we've expanded our product offering, including launching video advertising on the Tesco app.\nAcross our stores, distribution centers and offices, Tesco has been using machine learning for well over a decade. As technology improves, we are evolving how we use data and artificial intelligence. By leveraging these tools, we are generating deeper customer insights and driving innovation and operational efficiencies. This is enabling us to unlock future growth opportunities while optimizing our operations. For instance, we are utilizing data analytics within our retail media campaigns. Our Tesco Media team has developed [ smart stock, ] which can anticipate when customers are running low on household products. This allows us to send timely personalized reminders, helping both customers and suppliers and setting a new benchmark for precision-led retail media.\nIn addition, we can understand our customers better using our AI-powered range curation tool. The tool enables us to better tailor store offerings based on the shopping habits of local customers, ensuring more customers can find what they want when they want it.\nMoving to operational efficiencies. Our fleet is one of the largest in the country, transporting everyday essentials to stores and homes every minute. Routing software isn't new, but new AI-powered tools developed in-house are allowing us to optimize the combination of products, baskets and routes for every Tesco lorry and delivery van. In a business as large as ours, small changes can have a big effect. And these new tools have allowed us to remove around 100,000 miles per week.\nTo recap, we've started the year well, customers are responding to our investments and market share gains have been strong, which has been reflected in our financial performance. We remain determined to offer customers the best possible value while continuing to innovate. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on our longer-term growth opportunities to set ourselves up for future success. As we head into the second half, competition remains intense, and we are as focused as ever on delivering for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time. Imran and I would now be very happy to take your questions."

Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As always, I'd like to begin by thanking the Tractor Supply team for all they do and for their dedication to our purpose of serving life out here despite a softer-than-expected start to the year, given the delayed spring selling season, we're proud to report another quarter of strong execution by the Tractor Supply team. In the face of volatile weather and the shifting operating landscape, our team remained focused on what we could control, investing with purpose, managing costs with discipline and, most importantly, serving our customers.\nOn the customer front, the underlying health of our business remains strong and healthy. And I'll highlight four key indicators. One, we had robust transaction growth. Two, we also had strong unit growth in our consumable, usable and edible categories. Three, we had positive new customer counts. And four, we had record retention of existing customers. These customer indicators reinforce our belief that our customer base remains both healthy and engaged and that we continue to gain market share.\nNow I want to take a moment to address the updated guidance we issued today. Since we shared our initial outlook for 2025, the macro environment has clearly become more uncertain. Drawing on some of the scenario planning we used during the early days of COVID. Today, in addition to an updated fiscal year outlook, we're providing second quarter guidance. The updated fiscal year outlook is reflective of three primary considerations. One, it flows through the seasonal spring softness we've experienced to date. Two, it assumes that pressure on big ticket categories will persist for the remainder of the first half. And three, it reflects a range of scenarios related to tariff cost, that our vendor base and we are incurring in the second quarter. In other words, we've considered the implications of tariffs through the 90-day pause that began on April 9.\nWhile not our standard practice, given current conditions, as I mentioned, we are also providing second quarter guidance as we believe offering near-term visibility is important for our investors at this time. As always, our goal is to be transparent, and we remain committed to updating our outlook as we gain greater visibility. I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to walk you through the financials.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Hal, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our total sales were a record $3.47 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Comparable store sales declined 0.9%. This performance was driven by strong transaction growth of 2.1%, offset by a decline in average ticket of 2.9%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.34. These results were below our expectations, and we believe that weather was the key swing factor on our results in the quarter. As we analyze our performance across the weeks of the quarter, geographical regions, or product categories, the results point to the delay in spring seasonal shift as the key factor weighing on our results. We also recognize the evolving macroeconomic environment and are closely monitoring ongoing discussions around a potential economic slowdown and its impact on consumer spending. We do believe that some of the softness in big ticket categories reflects a degree of caution in consumer sentiment amid the current environment.\nThat said, based on our analysis of first quarter performance, we believe our underperformance was primarily driven by adverse weather conditions rather than broader macroeconomic trends. Where our business had a normal transition to spring, we were pleased with the results. Unfortunately, that was not in the vast majority of the country. and we estimate the arrival of spring was delayed by about 3 weeks across most of our markets, especially in the Midwest and Northeast, where there was snow just last week.\nLooking at the cadence of comparable store sales over the quarter. We began with a strong January, successfully comping over last year's performance. When evaluating January and February together, we were particularly pleased with the results in our cold weather categories, which performed well. However, the momentum has slowed as we moved into mid-February and March. Typically, we begin to see early signs of spring in the south by mid-February. But this year, that transition was delayed due to prolonged cold temperatures and winter storms, which extended into mid-March.\nAs a result, demand for spring seasonal categories was significantly softer than anticipated. In the first quarter, spring is much more important in the South than winter in the north. To give you some further perspective, our spring categories in the South were down about 30%. In total, we estimate that the delay in spring weather was a headwind of about 250 basis points. Also, it's important to recall that we were lapping an early Easter in 2024, which we estimate was approximately a $20 million headwind to comp sales in the quarter, particularly considering that March represents about 40% to 45% of the quarter.\nTurning to our geographic regional performance. It's helpful to view our markets through the lens of our northern and southern geographies. As I mentioned earlier, our southern markets were impacted by a slower spring season, which weighed on our overall results. In contrast, the northern markets delivered reasonably solid performance, especially considering the lingering cold weather. However, given the concentration of our store base and the relative size of our spring business in the South, the strength in the North was not enough to offset the headwinds we experienced in the South during the quarter. Simply put, when spring stalls in the south, it stalls the quarter, and that's exactly what we saw at this time.\nCategories that had the strongest performance were our winter seasonal products followed by year-round categories, including notable strength in our consumable, usable and edible products. Overall, our Q sales increased in the mid-single digits with unit growth in the high single digits. Given the extended cold weather in the quarter, a leading growth category was heating fuel, which was up north of 20%. Propane, wood pellets, bedding and pine savings are great examples of the resiliency of our business model. domestically sourced needs-based products. Additionally, products such as bird feeding and poultry feed had robust growth as did equine and livestock feed. We are only halfway through our Chick Days program, but we have been very pleased to date. Broadly, we believe that we continue to gain market share in pet food and our feed categories, even as key indicators like pet ownership, and cattle and horse counts continue to have modest declines.\nCategories that were a negative drag to our comp sales included our spring seasonal and related big-ticket items like riding lawn mowers and outdoor power equipment and our spring items in clothing and gifts and truck, tool and hardware. For perspective, our lawn and garden department declined low double digits, and riding lawn mowers were down about 25%.\nWhile certain seasonal categories weighed on our comparable sales, it's important to underscore the resilience and strength of our core business. In fact, our 2.1% increase in comp transactions highlights the underlying health of our model and the needs-based, demand-driven products our customers depend on us for day in and day out. Transaction growth was offset by a lower average ticket. Driven primarily by a negative product mix from fewer spring seasonal goods and modest pressure from lower average unit retail prices. Average unit retail was impacted by a low double-digit decline in big ticket items, and strong growth in lower-priced heating fuel. Combined, about 75% of our AUR decline is explained by these two categories alone. We also continue to experience modest product deflation of about 50 basis points, in line with our expectations. This decline was partially mitigated by increased units per transactions. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in unit growth and the underlying share gains in categories where deflation has had an outsized impact to AUR. Our gross margin rate of 36.2% increased 25 basis points to last year. This increase was primarily attributable to our disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of our everyday low price strategy. Our gross margin expansion was modestly below our expectations due to negative product mix given the softer spring sales, which carry a higher gross margin than our winter seasonal products.\nOur first quarter SG&A expense rate, including depreciation and amortization, increased 81 basis points to 29%. This increase in SG&A as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and last year's opening of our [ tent ] distribution center. We also had deleverage of our fixed costs, given the level of comparable store sales decline. These factors were partially offset by continued productivity and cost control as well as a modest benefit from our ongoing sale leaseback strategy. Operating income decreased 5.3% and to $249.1 million and net income decreased 9.5% to $179.4 million.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $122.4 million, returning $216.4 million of capital to shareholders. We also increased our dividend by 4.5%, marking our 16th consecutive year of growing our dividend. At the same time, we raised our share repurchase authorization by an incremental $1 billion.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a modest 1.5% increase in average inventory per store. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory at the end of the first quarter. The strength of our balance sheet remains a competitive advantage to position us well to navigate the dynamic macro environment.\nTurning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. As how noted, the macroeconomic landscape has become more uncertain since the start of the year. In light of these evolving conditions, we are updating our full year outlook to be reflective of the comments have made in his opening remarks. We now expect net sales growth between 4% and 8% and comparable store sales to range from flat to up 4%. We are forecasting an operating margin of 9.5% to 9.9%, with net income between $1.07 billion and $1.17 billion. This translates to earnings per share in the range of $2 to $2.18. While the tariff environment adds incremental pressure to our cost base, we are actively managing these impacts through close coordination with our vendor and supply chain partners with multiple scenarios in play, we're positioning the business towards the midpoint of these ranges.\nLooking to the second quarter, our guidance calls for net sales growth of approximately 3% to 4% comparable store sales between flat and up 1% and and earnings per diluted share of $0.79 to $0.81. As those of you that have followed us for some time know, we continue to believe the best way to look at our business is to view our performance on the halves. It's the way we manage our business and continues to be the best way to judge our performance. We are being prudent in our guidance to give the most realistic view based on what we know today. We are controlling our controllables and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy.\nIn this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line. while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. We will be disciplined in our capital investments and in our cost structure.\nWith more than 2.5 decades of experience with Tractor Supply, I have seen the company navigate through multiple business cycles. We know the playbook and are committed to our results standing tall in retail. We are closely monitoring consumer demand indicators and forward-looking signals, including shifts in consumer sentiment. Tractor Supply's long-standing track record of resilience and success positions us as a leader in the retail sector ready to seize the market share opportunities ahead and continue to deliver shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kurt. For the remainder of our prepared remarks, I would like to address the key questions and themes we have heard from many of you in the recent weeks. In this time of uncertainty, we want to make sure we're giving you a real-time view into how we're thinking about the business and the current dynamic environment. So let's start with the top question on everyone's mind. How is Tractor Supply managing through tariffs and corresponding price strategies.\nFirst, it's important to recognize this management team has a strong track record of navigating complexity with discipline and clarity. We've been through many other battles together, whether it was during the prior rounds of tariffs, inflationary spikes or supply chain disruption. We know how to operate in these environments and we're applying those same playbooks now. refined with even better data and sharper execution, building on our learnings from these past rounds. We begin from a position of strength on tariffs. This is not an existential crisis for Tractor Supply. Over 60% of our business is from products that are manufactured, bagged, assembled or grown in the United States and only 12% of our business is direct imports. And on our direct imports over the last several years, we've reduced the share from China from north of 90% to currently below 70%, and we're on track to be closer to 50% by year-end. When it comes to the recent tariff announcements, we're taking a proactive but measured approach. Like many, we stood up a task force, and our merchant sourcing, inventory and supply chain teams have been working 24/7 since.\nDespite our relatively advantaged retail business model, the increased costs are substantial for many of our manufacturing partners and us. One of the competitive advantage of Tractor Supply is our agile supply chain and deep vendor relationships. And we're working hard through vendor negotiations, diversified sourcing and smarter inventory planning to mitigate the cost pressures and ensure a strong inventory position in the second half. We've already had some good early wins, and I expect we'll continue to find ways to offset a portion of the cost and ensure key programs are available to our customers this fall and winter.\nOn pricing, our top priority is always to be an advocate of value for our customers. They rely on us to maintain their daily lives regardless of economic conditions, and we take that obligation very seriously. That said, we're already seeing requests for price increases from select vendors in areas of the market, and I fully expect that we'll see more in the coming weeks and months. Where we take price, we will be surgical, category by category, SKU by SKU, leveraging our portfolio strategy, always with a top priority being a focus on value perception, but also always with an understanding of margin sustainability.\nA bit on price elasticity. It's worth underscoring the needs-based nature of our core categories. Categories like pet food, animal feed, lubricants, wood pellets, shavings and many others are basically consumer staples. And repair categories like mower parts, trailer accessories and fencing are destination categories for us and ones that our customers count on us to extend the useful lives of their assets. The needs-based nature of our business gives us a level of resilience and pricing flexibility that many discretionary businesses don't have. Ultimately, our goal isn't just to offset cost. But it's to protect long-term trust with our customers. Our customer loyalty remains strong, and we feel confident in our ability to navigate this moment while continuing to grow profitably.\nThat leads to another question that's frequently asked. And that's around the health of our consumer and what trends we're seeing in consumer spending, including any indications of trade-down activity or shift in discretionary demand. I'll start by saying the health of our customer remains very stable, as I said at the outset, and engagement remains high through -- but understandably cautious.\nAnd as I get into this question, I'll start with the facts from Q1. Foot traffic in the quarter and transactions in the quarter both ran above last year, and we're not seeing discernible trade down in categories like feed and food. And as Kurt mentioned, big ticket was pressured. But that said, when the sun was out, seasonal big ticket was solid. And so getting a read on these categories in the quarter was difficult.\nNow the follow-up question that's often asked is, did you see any ships late in the quarter, and how has this shifted in Q2 given the recent drop in the stock market, headlines about potential recessions, noise on tariffs and also a continued delayed spring. And I'll start again in this quarter by saying that traffic and transactions continue to run positive and customer engagement remains strong. And I've been in the stores throughout the country in the past few weeks, and our customers are pursuing Life Out Here with the same passion as previous years. And I think much of the noise we see in the news has had little effect on them yet to date.\nOur Q categories are performing well. They continue to positively comp and in fact, we've seen a modest step-up in our pet run rate. We've continued, however, to see pressure in our big ticket categories early in Q2. With Eater Easter shifting and spring running roughly 3 weeks behind, as Curt mentioned, it's still difficult to parse whether consumer demand is delayed or fundamentally different this year. We'll continue to watch this closely, especially with 3 months of spring selling still ahead and a wide range of spending outcomes being forecasted by economists across our country. It's also important to keep inspective though, that big ticket only represents less than 15% of our business. To sum it up, reflecting back on our customers, they're resilient and they're passionate about their lifestyle. And while our business certainly isn't inelastic, our needs-based, demand-driven profile is very attractive and a long-term strength. In fact, we've only posted on negative comp year in the last 3 decades. Our customers are always looking for value, and we're confident that we will be well positioned if they choose to be more selective and stretch their budgets.\nNow shifting to a fun topic that's got a lot of headlines recently. And it's a question often asked is, how is your Chick Days performance been so far? And what's the continued outlook for the category this year. This year's event is on pace to deliver record-breaking results. And it's a great reflection of Tractor Supply's unique position as the go-to destination for backyard poultry. We're seeing continued momentum from our core customers who are expanding their flock alongside strong engagement this year from new customers in the category, many of whom are responding to the elevated egg prices and looking to take more control of their food supply.\nNow as you know, we're working with live animals, and that comes with lead times. And our demand forecast was set with hatcheries back in June of last year, which means our ability to flex up inventory in season is somewhat limited, but we still think this will be a record bird count this year. That said, the strong sell-through that we're also seeing speaks to the relevance of our assortment and expertise in this space and certainly drives our average unit retail up in the category. There's no question, this trend has generated terrific earned media for Tractor Supply, reinforcing our leadership in the backyard poultry space.\nIn addition, our Chick Days event continues to be a standout example of retail theater at its best. It brings our brand to life in a way that's highly engaged for customers, creates meaningful traffic in our stores and further strengthens our position as the destination for all things rural lifestyle. Also, our assortment of premium breads continues to lead the category and growth. And today, our customers over-index to poultry. And as we mentioned before, ownership of poultry is nearly one in five customers having chickens. Chick Days is like an annuity for Tractor Supply as birds typically live 5 to 7 years, and the reoccurring feed and supplies drives trips back to tractor supply. And a fun fact is that one chicken can eat over 75 pounds of feet a year, which keeps our customers coming back again and again.\nWe're also seeing strong comps in coops, chick toys and treats which is a clear sign that innovation and newness continue to resonate this year with our customers. And what's especially notable is the strength in big-ticket coops with some models approaching $1,000. It's a great example of customers investing in the Out Here lifestyle when they see innovation and value, as I mentioned. This year, as I said, is shaping up to be the most successful Chick Days event ever.\nShifting to another topic. As we've discussed several times on our earnings call, we've been dealing with since late 2023, the deflationary environment in many of our Q categories. We get asked consistently about inflationary signals. And specifically, at what point do we think we'll see deflation turn to inflation. On this point, I'll reinforce the guidance that we gave last quarter. Cutting aside the recent tariffs, we expect average unit retails benefiting from inflation in our two categories by the middle of the year. We believe that pet category is past its trough and is on the way to returning to historical trends. Additionally, one of the most important input commodities to our livestock feed, corn has been well above the low watermarks of last year. And as discussed in our view, it is likely that the new tariffs will lead to some level of inflationary pressures with that amount being determined. Net-net, we believe we're on the cusp of turning from deflation to inflation in our business.\nAnd finally, we've heard the broader question about our willingness to continue to invest in our Life Out Here 2030 strategic initiatives if the economy were to be in a slowdown. I'll start on this question by reinforcing the multitude of compelling nutritive growth opportunities Tractor Supply is targeting. We share these as part of our Life Out Here 2030 strategy at our Investor Day in December, and we're even more excited about them now. Many of these multiyear investments are being implemented in an asset-light manner, especially the sales driving initiatives like localization, direct sales and Pet Rx and afford us ability to push investment into 2026, if appropriate to do so. We have not made a decision to do so at this point, but we'll continue to evaluate business conditions and make these decisions as appropriate.\nNow a quick update on a few of the initiatives. Tractor Supply, Pet Rx. We launched that earlier this week, and it's a great opportunity for us to scale on our acquisition of Allivet. The team moved with speed and agility to integrate Alive with the Tractor Supply website. With this quarter, we reached a milestone of 40 million Neighbor's Club members. As I said, the majority of whom have a pet or animal, and we have an opportunity to offer an easy and affordable solution for their Rx needs. Great first quarter progress on this acquisition.\nWe've also made strong progress on our direct sales initiative. The first batch of sales teams have now launched in select markets and they're building on the foundation we're laying with the rollout of our final mile delivery hubs in concert. At the same time, we've also begun the first phase of localizing our stores and each customer archetype has now been executed out in the market. Stepping back in a slowing growth environment, our prioritization is to always balance growth and margins. We're keenly focused on managing risk. This is a cycle-tested management team to successfully manage through the prior round of tariffs, and we were very successful during the pandemic and all the supply chain disruptions have followed as well. We'll be prudent and nimble with our investments to balance the short term with the significant long-term opportunities we see ahead.\nTo wrap it up, if you take just one thing from our call today, let it be this. Tractor Supply is built for resilience. Tariffs, weather, deflation to inflation, none of it changes our focus or belief in the strength of our durable business model. Our flywheel has stood the test of time. We operate in needs-based categories. We know our customers well, and we continue to invest in capabilities that will continue to build on our competitive advantages. Our team is focused. Our balance sheet is strong, and our long-term strategy is working. We're confident in our ability to navigate through the current environment and emerge even stronger on the other side.\nMy deepest gratitude and heartfelt banks again, goes out to our Tractor Supply team for their unwavering dedication to bonding our mission and values each and every day. This commitment is the driving force behind our continued success. Operator, we'd now like to open up the call for questions. And I'll also add that today, in addition to SEP, we also have Rob Mills, John Ordus and Colin Yank in the room. Thank you."

Thank you for your time and attention this morning. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the recent wildfires and winter storms. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. I'd also like to express our deepest appreciation to the first responders who worked tirelessly to protect our communities during these challenging times. Our Tractor Supply team has and will continue to stand with our communities as they recover from these events. The opening video, I think, did an excellent job highlighting the key accomplishments of the Tractor Supply team in 2024.\nAnd my sincere appreciation and gratitude go out to the team for all they do. Over the year, our team consistently executed with distinction and delivered solid results in a tepid retail environment. Additionally, the team made progress against our Life out Here strategy, enabling continued market share gains and future growth. Now let's go through some of our highlights specific to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, starting with financials.\nIn the fourth quarter, our net sales grew 3.1%, and comparable store sales increased 0.6%, driven by strong comp transaction growth of 2.3%. And our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.44. For the fiscal year, we achieved record financial results on both the top and bottom line. Net sales were nearly $14.9 billion, growing 2.2% versus 2023 with a comp store sales increase of 0.2%. Diluted earnings per share were also a record $2.04 on a split adjusted basis. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1.1 billion.\nAnd I'll note -- these results are on top of record performance over the last 4 years. In 2024, we also generated a record $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. And we use this cash flow to fund the business and attractive growth opportunities. In 2024, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 11 Petsense stores. The team has done a fantastic job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. Other business investments we made in 2024 include a new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas and more than 160 Fusion remodels. After funding our business in these initiatives, for the fourth consecutive year, we returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nAnd 2024 marked the 15th consecutive year of dividend growth for Tractor Supply. And finally, at the conclusion of the year, we successfully acquired Allivet, and we look forward to integrating Allivet into our business and offering it to our millions of Neighbor's Club members who are pet owners. In addition to these financial results and even more importantly, perhaps, our team member and customer engagement has never been stronger. Frontline team member attrition is at a record low. Total active customer accounts are at record highs. High-value customer retention is at record levels. Customer service scores continue to hit all-time highs. In our Neighbor's Club, one of the largest loyalty programs in retail continues to attract record levels of new customers and we're exiting 2024 with all-time highs in both retention rates and retained customer counts.\nNeighbor's Club is truly a key differentiator for Tractor Supply, and we're committed to continued enhancements. For example, in 2024, our members benefited from more personalized offers, new tiers and more meaningful rewards. Additionally, the expansion of Neighbor's Club to Petsense by Tractor Supply continues to drive strong customer engagement. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new pet customers to both banners. Neighbor's Club membership currently represents over 85% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 50%, an increase of nearly 3 points year-over-year.\nOverall, Neighbor's Club membership now exceeds $38 million, and as a percent of our sales reached a record 80%. With our Life out Strategy, we have built on Tractor Supply's long-standing commitment to invest in our powerful flywheel. We've substantially transformed our business and are operating from a higher level of performance. We've not given back any of the gains that we've made over the last 5 years, and we delivered against our strategy, and we're very excited about the future. As we planned for 2025, we're forecasting strong net sales growth of 5% to 7% and comp sales performance of 1% to 3%.\nWe anticipate that the headwinds we've been facing will moderate as we move through the year and that we continue our share gains. We expect product deflation should be relatively neutral by mid-2025, and additionally, we see signs of stabilization in both personal consumption expenditure and the balance of goods versus services as well as in the pet food category. As it relates to the new presidential administration, while there are many knowns that we acknowledge, for example, tariffs, we are confident in our ability to navigate these circumstances as they evolve.\nAdditionally, I'll note that many of these unknowns are not Tractor Supply specific. And on most fronts, our business profile is attractive on a relative basis to other retailers and companies. As we shared at our recent investment community day in December, we remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when market conditions return to neutral. Tractor Supply is a unique and highly differentiated retailer. We have a history of executing with discipline on our strategy, delivering strong financial results and continue to expand our competitive moat.\nWe continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy. We're excited about the continued evolution of our Life Out Here strategy that builds on our strengths, continues the momentum of our existing strategy and launches new initiatives that increase our total addressable market to $225 billion. We're entering the New Year with momentum and opportunity.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThanks, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let's start with some key insights for the fourth quarter and full year. I'll spend the bulk of my time on our outlook for 2025. We had a solid performance given the overall conditions for the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales increased 0.6%, driven by strong comparable average transaction increase of 2.3%, partially offset by a comparable average ticket decrease of 1.7%. Of note, unit volumes were solid and the ticket pressure was principally from average unit retail. For the fourth quarter, we always believe that weather trumps the holiday.\nTypically, the winter weather has a much greater impact to the fourth quarter. And once again, that is how this year played out. In addition, we continue to face the ongoing headwind of deflation in key product categories. We estimate that deflation had approximately 100 basis point drag on our comp sales performance in the quarter. Most of the deflation pressure came from commodity-based products consistent with the recent trends. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw a positive impact from the early October hurricanes. While the warmer-than-usual temperatures in late October and November presented some challenges, December had a modest improvement in the weather and solid holiday performance, demonstrating our resilience and ability to adapt to varying conditions.\nTurning to the category performance for the quarter. We had strong comps in our seasonal department as well as truck tool and hardware with both performing better than chain average. Our consumable, usable and edible products performed in line with chain average. Notably, we had mid-single-digit unit growth as we continue to believe we are gaining share in these categories overall. The strength of our unit growth in Q was offset by ongoing deflation. No doubt the warm weather in November and to a lesser extent, December weighed on our winter seasonal business.\nOverall, our spring and summer seasonal categories drove positive comp sales with Zero Turn and front-engine mowers, both up double digits. This is indicative of the unseasonably warm weather we had in the quarter. Cold weather-related categories, such as insulated outerwear and heating modestly underperformed chain average due to the warm weather conditions. Big ticket performance continued to outperform in the low single digits. We experienced strength in hurricane response categories like generators.\nAdditionally, grilling, mowers, trailers and truck toolboxes all performed well. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance for the holiday season.\nMoving on to gross margin. Gross margin decreased 9 basis points to 35.2% from the prior year's fourth quarter. It is worth calling out that we were lapping our most difficult gross margin comparison of the quarter with 129 basis points of expansion in the prior year. Our performance was relatively in line with our expectations. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 26.8%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, including higher depreciation and the onboarding of a new distribution center and modest deleverage of our fixed costs, given the level of comparable store sales growth.\nThese factors were partially offset by the team's disciplined focus on productivity and our ongoing emphasis on cost control. We did have a modest benefit from our ongoing sale leaseback strategy. This quarter, we had a similar number of existing store sales as the prior year with a slightly higher average gain per store. Operating margin declined 69 basis points for the quarter to 8.4%.\nNow let's move to our outlook for 2025. As I have previously shared, navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have a long track record of successfully managing through diverse market conditions. The needs-based nature of our business, combined with our deep understanding of these dynamics, allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. The same can be said about tariffs.\nAs Hal commented in his opening remarks, there are certainly a number of unknowns at this time on this important topic. This is a team that has been cycle tested with lessons learned from the prior administration. For instance, we have continued to diversify our country of origin for imports. We have been scenario planning and are prepared to address as any proposed actions take effect. It is important to remember that this is a topic that affects all of retail. We are differentiated as we only have about 12% or so of our sales that are direct imports and have a large [ Q ] business that is domestically sourced. Given the fluid nature of the discussion on tariffs and the number of unknowns, our guidance does not assume any changes in tariffs at this time.\nWe successfully managed through tariffs in prior cycles, we will remain flexible and nimble to adapt to the changing environment. For fiscal 2025, we are forecasting net sales growth of 5% to 7% to $15.6 billion to $15.9 billion. Approximately 4 points of this growth is driven by new stores and Allivet. With a purchase price of $135 million, we anticipate Allivet adding more than $100 million to our net sales and accretive to earnings. Comparable store sales are anticipated to increase 1% to 3%. We expect modest gross margin expansion of about 20 to 40 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost and price management and our exclusive brands and retail media initiatives.\nWe anticipate a relatively stable and consistent overall transportation market. We forecast the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase about 10% with a higher growth rate in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth rates, as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate, we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales.\nSecond, we are investing in our Life Out Here 2030 strategic initiatives. In order to launch our direct sales and Final Mile initiatives, we are planning a net investment of about 15 to 20 basis points of operating margin into these exciting opportunities for growth. In 2025, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. As we recently indicated at our Investment Community Day, we expect to sell an incremental 2 to 4 existing stores to fund the step-up in new stores from 80 to 90 in 2025.\nWe anticipate these sales will occur across the year with a similar EPS contribution as in 2024 in total. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.6% to 10%, centering around our 2024 performance. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of a little over 2x. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.2% to 22.5%. Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $2.10 to $2.22. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $650 million to $725 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales.\nThis net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds from the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be around $1 billion. Our capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 90 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening about 10 Petsense stores this year. Our new store pipeline remains exceptionally strong, continue to exceed historical averages in both sales and profitability. We expect our store opening cadence to be in line with 2024.\nAs we announced this week, we anticipate starting construction of our 11th distribution center in Idaho later this year with operations commencing in late 2026 or early 2027. This is an exciting expansion of our DC network that will allow us to more effectively service our existing stores and new store growth opportunities in the Pacific Northwest. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2025, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $525 million to $600 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 1% to 2%.\nNow I'd like to walk through a few items to consider for the calendarization of our expectations. As always, we believe the best way to look at our results is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2025 guidance. We anticipate that comp sales will be modestly stronger in the second half of the year as our compares ease and the headwind from deflation continues to moderate. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year, along with flat to slightly positive average ticket. We anticipate that deflation will be a modest headwind in the first half of the year. We believe we are nearing the trough now having successfully managed through the deflation of 2023 and 2024.\nAs to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be relatively consistent between the first half and second half of the year. As we see it today, our forecast calls for the first half of the year to have marginally better operating margin performance than the second half as we begin to cycle recent transportation efficiencies. Specific to the first quarter, we've had a solid start to the year given the recent cold weather trends.\nAs a reminder, January last year was also very cold with strong comps. We are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter, recognizing we have a lot of the quarter ahead of us. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted EPS is anticipated to be relatively consistent with the prior year as our positive sales growth is somewhat offset by our investments in the business.\nWe are planning for continued gross margin expansion to be offset by incremental investments to launch our strategic initiatives and the operational costs for our new Arkansas distribution center, which opened in mid-2024. As a consequence, operating margin is anticipated to be flat to slightly below prior year.\nTo wrap up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market. We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2025 as we self-fund our Life Out Here 2030 initiatives. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. As we shared in December at our Investment Community Day, we're embarking on the next leg of growth for Tractor Supply with our Life Out Here 2030 strategy. This strategy is designed to continue to invest in what's working as well as begin investments in several new opportunities, creating horizons of growth that we expect to last through the end of the decade. Key initiatives in our Life Out Here strategy will continue to be our Project Fusion and Garden Center rollouts. Both of these projects are working well and delivering compelling returns through improved space productivity.\nIn 2025, these initiatives will be complemented with enhanced localization capabilities. Specifically, the team has developed data-driven archetypes that tailor approximately 25% of store space to better reflect customer need and further optimize the incremental sales opportunity of each unique site. Going forward, all new stores and our Fusion remodels will have localized space allocation and assortment based on their respective architypes.\nTurning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to continue to capitalize on this unique, strategic asset. A significant focus for us this year will be to bring our members PetRx through our recent Allivet acquisition. The acquisition of Allivet expands our total addressable market by $15 billion to $225 billion. Allivet has a proven platform to make pet ownership easier by providing convenient access to brand-name medications, expert pharmacy advice and convenient reordering with its AutoShip program. Our efforts in Q1 are focused on integrating Allivet's catalog onto tractorsupply.com and updating a member's Neighbor's Club profile to include their prescription and veterinarian information.\nWe look forward to providing our 38 million Neighbor's Club members with a value-added pet and animal prescription service and introducing Tractor Supply to Allivet's customers. As Kurt mentioned, we're investing in this year in several new key strategic initiatives, especially direct sales and Final Mile. It is critical to get them off to a strong start, and the team is keenly focused on our multiyear journey to capture the significant opportunity with these initiatives.\nIn direct sales, our efforts in the first half are focused on building a scalable field sales model and launching Version 1 of our business-to-business selling platform. In Final Mile, our efforts in the first half are focused on hardening our existing delivery hubs, activating inventory across more locations and bringing bulk online orders in-house for delivery. While our long-term strategy sets the foundation for sustained growth, our 2025 operating plans are designed to deliver measurable results today, ensuring we continue to meet our evolving customers' needs and build momentum towards achieving our long-term goals.\nAs mentioned, the year has started solid, and our teams have been busy supporting our customers for all their winner needs as the dependable supplier of the Out Here Lifestyle, from heating fuel and heating pellets to insulated winter clothing to livestock feed, we are highly engaged in ensuring our customers have what they need to deal with the recent winter storms and recovery. As the calendar will soon term to string, we've already transitioned over 600 of our stores to our spring sets and the remainder [indiscernible] over the next couple of months. Our merchant teams have done an excellent job bringing value and innovation to our lineups for spring. Examples include expanding Weber Grilling to all stores and launching exclusive Zero-Turn mowers from Cub Cadet and the second year of the Toro Havoc as well as introducing new National Live Goods programs, and we have so much more, and I look forward to sharing more details on spring in our Q1 earnings call.\nAs always, we are laser-focused on our key categories. In our Companion Animal segment, we're pleased to launch new products, both in-store and online. We recently launched 4Health Shreds, we expanded our Temptations assortment in cat, and we introduced new freeze-dried and shelf-stable treats. In the market now, we have our annual Pet Appreciation Days with a month of targeted savings offers and in-store events to drive excitement. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our over 1,000 Pet Wash locations.\nAnd last year, we conducted over 1.8 million pet washes including a record-breaking 500,000 plus in Q4. our Pet Aisle is more robust than ever, featuring familiar favorites as well as new unique offerings that deliver the quality our customers expect at incredible value. In our Animal segment, Spring at Tractor Supply means it's time for our annual spring chick days. The arrival of chick at our stores is a sure sign of spring and creates strong retail theater in our stores. Backyard poultry continues to see significant engagement with our customers, highlighting a shift towards sustainable and self-reliance living. Whether as pets or as a source of eggs, chicks are both the practical and enjoyable hobby for many and are often referred to as the third pet.\nWe have more shopping trends and insights than ever on our poultry customers and are able to build out more targeted campaigns based on where they are in their journey. As our customers build and maintain their flocks, we have everything they need for feed, treats, toys and an exciting lineup of new chicken coops. Our retail philosophy is that Chick Days is a great gateway for our customers to deepen their relationship with Tractor Supply and that enables tractor Supply then to be viewed as a resource for all things related to homesteading beyond the poultry category. Earlier this week, we announced a multiyear strategic licensing partnership with Field & Stream. Beginning in June, Tractor Supply customers could shop a variety of hunting and outdoor Field & Stream branded products. We're excited about the opportunity this partnership presents and look forward to providing more details in future earnings calls.\nAs the season turns to spring, I hope you get a chance to visit our stores and see the actions and initiatives coming to life. Our future remains exceptionally bright and exciting. Our upcoming initiatives scale and capabilities demonstrate our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're excited about the future and look forward to continuing our journey of growth and innovation in the channel. I'd like to close where I started. By extending my gratitude to our team members for their unwavering dedication to each other and to serving our customers. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing us as their trusted supply [indiscernible] also call out our 2,300-plus communities for embracing us as an integral part of our hometowns.\nWith that, operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions."

Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this morning. In 2023, Tractor Supply celebrated our milestone 85th anniversary. Over 85 years, Tractor Supply has been a growth company with a clear purpose to help our customers live life out here. Since 1938, we've operated in all types of economic conditions, embraced innovation and adapted to changing times. We've elevated the farm and ranch channel, bringing the sophistication of other retail categories to improve the shopping journey and ensure we have scalable platforms. Tractor Supply's needs-based, demand-driven business model has stood the test of time. No doubt this past year has proved challenging, more top [ interview ] than we expected with the beginning of the year with unfavorable weather, rising interest rates and inflation impacting consumer spending habits but we believe these headwinds are temporary.\nWe continue to invest for growth in 2023 and gain market share along the way, especially in companion animal and livestock feed. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of the team's significant accomplishments across Tractor Supply in the year and over the last few years. As I reflect on 2023, a our Tractor Supply team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our customers and our communities, and our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro and other headwinds while also building our future. I sincerely thank them for living our mission and values.\nIn 2023, we faced the well-documented macro headwinds that weighed on consumer goods spending, particularly discretionary goods, as well as unfavorable weather impacts every quarter on our business. While we've made progress over the years to deseasonalize our business, we will always be the reliable supplier for our customers for their seasonal needs like heating fuel and fertilizer. We estimate that adverse weather conditions negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 200 basis points for the full year, including the lapping of the late December winter storm in 2022. Personal consumption expenditures saw strong mid-single-digit growth in 2023. That said, spending on goods as a percent of PCE declined nearly 1 point as consumers continue to shift spending on services back to pre-COVID levels.\nIn particular, this affected our big ticket business, which represents a little over 10% of our sales and had a negative 6% comp for the year. Despite the headwinds we faced, we remain committed to our journey of transforming Tractor Supply. Since introducing our Life Out Here strategy in October of 2020, we have dramatically transformed Tractor Supply. Over this time, we've invested nearly $2.5 billion in capital spending with about 80% of that spend targeted for growth initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. This includes new and remodeled stores new distribution centers, upgrading our technology infrastructure and several other strategic investments. We've also significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint and delivering on the increased volume of consumable, usable and edible products.\nAdditionally, our average store volume continues to far exceed prepandemic levels, going from $4.5 million to $6.5 million annually per store. Approximately 40% of our stores are in the Project Fusion layout, allowing us to drive improved space productivity. We continue to see a mid-single-digit comp lift benefit in the first year from our Fusion remodel. We will enter the spring of 2024 with more than 450 garden centers that are also driving space productivity while allowing us to enter into new categories that resonate with our customers' hobbies for gardening and their needs for outdoor products. Stores with our garden centers are attracting new customers at a faster pace than the rest of the chain.\nAdditionally, our garden center stores are providing a multiyear comp benefit. Our distribution centers achieved a record year of productivity. The opening of our [ Novar ], Ohio DC in January 2023 allowed us to unlock savings across our network with the largest rebalancing of our stores ever. This provided us with substantial [ stem ] mile savings while also allowing for significantly improved service to our stores. Also importantly, our supply chain team member attrition reduced materially as we implemented a new progressive wage scale. And no doubt, these investments are resonating with our customers as we have achieved record high customer satisfaction scores throughout the year.\nAs always, our store managers were critical to the success and importantly, we achieved a near all-time low of 12% attrition in this group. Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Now let's go through some of the specific highlights to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. For the year, we achieved record sales of $14.6 billion. Our comp store sales were even with the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $10.09. This comes on top of record performance over the last 3 years. We continue to have solid market share gains across our major product categories. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1 billion annually for the first time. Since launch, we have had over 7 million downloads of our mobile app and over 2 million in the year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales declined 4.2%.\nOur fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.28 with operating profit margin expansion of 16 basis points. For the second consecutive year, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Strategically, the transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that are designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin reinforces our long-term guidance. In 2023, we raised our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion, our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores from our previous target of 2,800.\nWe also implemented new capabilities to enable own development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allow for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Our real estate capabilities are a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. In 2023, the cadence of new store openings returned to a more normalized rate. We opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores in 13 Petsense stores in 2023. The team has done a great job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency for Tractor Supply.\nDuring the year, we successfully converted the 81 Orscheln stores acquired in 2022 to the Tractor Supply brand representing essentially a year's worth of new store growth. We're very pleased with the opportunity to drive both top line and bottom line performance of these locations closer to our standard run rates over time. Total customer count increased 1% And. As we had positive growth in active customers and new reactivated customers. Neighbor's Club added more than 4 million new customers and represented 77% of our sales for the year, our highest mark to date. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the year, we reached a new record for the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping us more frequently, and spending more money per transaction. Last year's rebranding a Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply, along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense, is also resonating with our customers.\nThis expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new [ other pet ] customers to both banners. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 70% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping at Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 47%. Petsense is also helping us gain share across pet specialty as we approach $225 million in sales and our 200 store milestone in the Petsense brand. For the year, our financial services offering of our private label credit card, together with our co-branded credit card outpaced our overall sales with strong growth. Our penetration increased from last year's record level and is now in the high single digits in overall sales. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. During the year, we opened up our ninth distribution center in Novar, Ohio and broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Mall mill, Arkansas.\nThese were investments were to enable the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. These investments in our DC network are complemented by our 15 mixing centers that are there for high-velocity replenishment items. In 2023, we moved nearly 8.5 billion pounds of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the largest seller of [ bag ] feeding food for livestock and companion animals in the United States. Our scale and reach provides us with the cost to serve that is lower than our farm and ranch competition and any other competitor in these markets. As we executed the third year of our Life Out Here long-term strategy, 2023 was a year that we made significant progress.\nWe plan to continue building on that progress in 2024. Most of what you'll hear from us today, we'll sell all that different from the playbook we've used for the last 2 to 3 years but that's intentional as we continue to be pleased with the benefits and financial returns of our strategic investments. As I've shared many times, our biggest challenge is prioritizing the plethora of growth opportunities we have ahead of us. And we anticipate 2024 to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook with it being below our long-term target. We remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when macro conditions return to neutral.\nOur underlying assumptions start with consumers continuing to be judicious and they're spending on good. Additionally, we anticipate average ticket to be pressured as we lap inflation. We're assuming market share gains that are supported by our strategic initiatives will continue. Housing, oil, agriculture and weather are anticipated to be neutral factors in our guidance. Collectively, all these factors are considered to help us provide the guidance range that Kurt will share with you more later on. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a needs-based business that is tailored to our Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. I want to start by reiterating Hal's comments on 2023 and our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Tractor Supply. Over my 2.5 decades in this business, I've never seen a year where we've had many transitory headwinds as we did in 2023 that did not break positively at some point during the year. Before I get into my review of the quarter, I wanted to address 2 items. First, for comparability purposes, please keep in mind, 2022 had a 53rd fiscal week that provided a net sales benefit of $225 million to the prior year fourth quarter, representing about 5.6 percentage points of our net sales decline this quarter. On a full year basis, it negatively impacted net sales by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, diluted EPS in 2022 benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year from the 53rd week.\nSecond, overall, the unseasonably warm winter weighed on our results in the fourth quarter. We estimate the impact to be approximately 400 basis points of pressure on our comp sales performance. We knew this was going to be the most challenging quarter of the year, given our strong comp performance of 8.6% in the prior year as we were cycling the late December 2022 winter storm that provided a 200 basis point comp benefit to the fourth quarter of last year. The majority of the pressure was in transactions, given the needs-based nature of our business and it impacted our seasonal categories across Q and other winter goods. Our Q business in the fourth quarter has a higher mix of cold weather seasonal products such as wood pellets, bulk propane, bird feed and pine savings for bedding.\nFrom the cadence of the quarter to our product categories, seasonal impacts always play into our performance. Coming into the fourth quarter, we anticipated it would work against us and the quarter played out much like we expected. Factoring in the seasonal impact from the weather, our fourth quarter performance was very much in line with our run rate from last quarter. Most of my remaining commentary of our comp sales performance is on a normalized basis, adjusting for the impact of weather. October and November were very similar in comp sales performance, with December seeing the biggest comp sales decline as we were lapping the winter storm from last year. On a normalized basis, all months performed relatively consistent with a slight decline in comp sales.\nTurning to our product categories. We continue to see solid performance in Q with above chain average comps, essentially flat for the quarter. On a normalized basis, Q had a positive comparable sales as we continue to gain share. Discretionary categories performed in line with our expectations with a mid-single-digit comp sales decline. Big ticket performance showed a continued improvement over the trends of the previous 5 quarters. Comparable big ticket sales ran slightly negative for the quarter and were positive in the low single digits on a normalized basis. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance in the week leading up to Christmas.\nAs we have experienced all year, we saw a continued slowdown in retail price inflation throughout the year, with Q4 experiencing a slight net deflation. We have successfully managed through deflation in various commodities throughout 2023, and believe we are nearing the trough now. In 2023, raw material inputs rolled over as evidenced by the 35% decline in corn from its most recent high in 2022 and currently running about 15% above the historical average. As we exit 2023, these types of feedstock declines are already reflected in our retail prices. Structural inflationary factors such as higher wage rates, transportation costs and other overhead items are all still supporting higher product costs.\nMoving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our trend of strong gross margin performance continued with a year-over-year improvement of 129 basis points to 35.3% of sales. Our gross margin expansion was led by improvements in the supply chain from lower transportation rates and efficiencies in our network, including opening a new DC. We continue to benefit from our commitment to everyday low prices, and disciplined product cost management. While our promotional activity was modestly greater than the prior year, we were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. These favorable drivers were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shift due to a higher mix of Q and a lower mix of high-margin seasonal categories.\nAs a percent of that sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 113 basis points year-over-year to 26.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A, although to a lesser extent than last quarter. The SG&A deleverage was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation and the benefits of the sale-leaseback program initiated last quarter. In Q4, we sold 5 Tractor Supply stores, which contributed a 40 basis point benefit to SG&A. Operating margin improved 16 basis points for the quarter to 9.1%. Excluding the cycling of the 53rd week, diluted EPS of $2.28 was essentially flat with the prior year.\nOur new store pipeline continues to be strong. Our new store sales and profitability numbers continue to outperform historical averages. Given the addition of the Orscheln stores to our noncomp sales numbers, the new store productivity metric for the organic new Tractor Supply stores is cloudy in our external reporting. By our calculations, TSC new store productivity in 2023 was about 67% of our mature store average. Average sales in year 1 of a new store have increased more than 40% compared to 2019, in line with the performance of the chain. Our stores continue to be profitable in year 1, cash flow positive at about the same point and have a payback in 2 to 3 years. Our new store economics unlock sustainable growth and solidify our lead in the channel. Strong new store economics are a hallmark of Tractor Supply. As I reflect back on 2023, I continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our business and the structural nature of it.\nNow let's move to our outlook for 2024. Hal shared how we are thinking about the macro backdrop for the coming year. We are anticipating a gradual slowdown with the lingering question of do we have a soft landing or if the risk of a harder recession remains. With this in mind, we have taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook and have forecasted our comparable sales performance below our long-term algorithm. Navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have successfully managed through diverse market conditions, including periods of inflation to disinflation and even deflation. Our deep understanding of these dynamics allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. We expect average unit retails to be neutral to a modest headwind for the near term as we anticipate stickiness to input costs such as labor wage rates and other items to mitigate any further reversion in commodity pricing.\nFor fiscal 2024, we are forecasting net sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion. Comparable store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down a modest 1% to an increase of 1.5%. We are cautiously optimistic that big ticket trends will revert to positive for the full year as we are cycling 18 months of declines. We expect gross margin expansion of about 40 to 60 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost management and a moderation of the mix impact of Q. We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage And due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase in the mid-teens. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales.\nSecond, we plan to open our tenth distribution center in the second quarter. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. Our DC network is expected to pressure SG&A by approximately 10 to 15 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. As a result, we expect modest pressure on our operating margin from the opening of this new DC. These 2 primary factors are partially offset by the lapping of some higher-than-normal medical benefits in 2023. We do not expect those to reoccur due to our proactive changes to our benefit programs.\nIn 2024, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. We anticipate these sales will occur in the second half of the year on a similar cadence to 2023 and with a similar EPS contribution. We continue to forecast these strategic sale leasebacks to be ongoing for the next 7 to 10 years. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 10.1%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of approximately 2x, and we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23.0%. The Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $9.85 to $10.50. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $625 million to $700 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales. This net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds for the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be in the range of $850 million to $925 million.\nOur capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening 10 to 15 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 2024. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid, and we expect store opening cadence B in line with 2024. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $575 million to $625 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Now I'd like to walk through a few items to consider for the calendarization of our expectations.\nAs always, we believe the best way to look at our business is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2024 guidance. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be slightly more favorable in the first half as opposed to the second half. There are a few factors that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to benefit our results through the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. As a result, gross margin expansion for the first half of the year is anticipated to be near the high end of our annual guidance range, while the second half may be near the low end of the range.\nIn regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. Please keep in mind, we will be lapping an $0.08 per share benefit from the depreciation change in the third quarter of last year. Considering each of these factors, the third quarter will be our toughest earnings comparison as we anticipate a decline in operating margin and EPS due to the combination of these factors. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation beginning in the second quarter with a tiered approach as we cycle the timing of moving these stores to our point-of-sale systems and rebranding of stores to Tractor Supply.\nSpecific to the first quarter, we had a challenging first quarter last year as it was abnormally warm in January and February and relatively cold March. We were also benefiting from retail price inflation in the high single digits. Given the recent Arctic cold temperatures across most of the regions, we are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. To wrap up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market. We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2024. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kurt. Now I'd like to update you on our progress on our Life Out Here strategy and share more about the exciting plans we have in place for the spring season. Tractor Supply continues to build on our competitive advantages. And arguably, the company is as strong as it's ever been. This is backed up by several proof points. We continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy with strong spending and retention with our best customers. Our strategic priorities are clearly resonating with our customers. We continue to see strength in our brand equity metrics, continue to grow our brand consideration and our unaided awareness. These strong customer trends are attributed to the team. The team is executing at a high level and is extremely engaged.\nIn 2023, our turnover improved at every level across the company as we're committed to being an employer of choice in rural America. With customer satisfaction scores at an all-time high, the team is passionate about their work, and we're energized to capitalize on our growth investments to provide our customers with legendary service. Our strong culture has always been a part of our secret sauce. The team has dialed in and determined to build on our long track record of success. Our Life Out Here strategy is on point. Our strategic initiatives in Project Fusion, Garden Centers, Neighbor's Club and Digital are working and they are driving results. In 2024, we anticipate that our Project Fusion layout will be in about 50% of our store base by year-end. This layout is clearly driving improved comp sales force as we're leveraging category insights to determine space allocation and drive productivity.\nFor instance, in the companion animal categories, we're seeing that the Fusion layouts are contributing to strong growth. We're able to have an expanded SKU offering and larger stack out. This layout is also seeing the highest quartile of customer satisfaction scores and attracting new customers at a faster rate. 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center for us. We will leverage the change of seasons across the storefront as the year shifts to spring. We will continue to build out about 150 garden centers across both new stores and sidelight transformations this year. As we look to leverage our learnings from our garden centers, we will implement a new live goods center prototype in many of these locations. This new prototype requires about half of the capital investment of a traditional garden center that we've been building over the last few years and allows us to maximize the value creation of a sideline in lower volume stores and in markets where the season is less extensive and thus allowing us to achieve the ROIs that we target.\nAdditionally, the new prototype in many ways, makes it easier for our stores to operate from a staffing standpoint and the maintenance costs are lower. With more broadly than ever and a grower network to support our garden centers, we're excited about the benefit of these initiatives in 2024 and the continued opportunity to serve our customers. Now turning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to capitalize on this strategic asset. Our loyalty program has the scale and scope to continue to drive meaningful results. As we enter the third year since the move to a point-based rewards program, our members can expect more personalized offers, new tiers and more meaningful rewards. These compelling enhancements are designed to drive transactions and engagement all while migrating customers upwards.\nMoving on to our digital business. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our growth between our website and our mobile app, we have more visitors online now than we do in our stores. These digital assets are essentially the front door to Tractor Supply. We'll be focused this year on improving our digital customer experience and capability as we look to accelerate conversion rate. Just as the trip to a Tractor Supply store is highly differentiated, we'll be doubling down to ensure the shopping experience on our website and our mobile app has that same level of differentiation as we shop across our destination categories. We are looking to mirror our in-store legendary service and the digital experience through personalized and conversational commerce.\nWe will leverage AI technologies to improve search, redesign our checkout, introduce a new refreshed homepage focusing on personalization that leverages our robust Neighbor's Club data. As our customer base continues to skew younger, these improvements will be key to unlocking future growth. Our strategic priorities are resonating with our customers and driving strong returns. As the calendar shifts now and we start to turn to spring, it's an exciting time to be in our stores and online. In 2024, our merchant teams will be as diligent as ever to be our customers' purchasing agent with a sharp focus on value and innovation. We're committed to everyday low price, and we simply will not be beyond value. Our customers can trust Tractor Supply to be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. Our merchandising strategies are focused to drive profitable sales and market share.\nAcross product categories, we will have more innovation this year that I believe we will have seen collectively over the last 3 years. We have a number of new and exclusive product launches, including the introduction of the Toro Havoc zero-turn mower, the expansion of YETI and Solo Stove to more stores and a test of Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer, a limited rollout of [ Preferred ] cattle fencing and a limited rollout of Weber Grill, a relaunch of MuttNation from Miranda Lambert and the addition of Triumph equine feed, and that's just to name a few of the new innovations that we're bringing to our customers, and they'll be able to find in-store and online. Let me share a few more highlights that you can see in our stores as you get out there. Tractor Supply has long been a destination for zero-turn mowers with a Cub Kid ad and Bad Boy brand. The Toro havoc addition will continue to reinforce that positioning.\nOutside of Toro's dealer network Toro Havoc is exclusive to Tractor Supply with a sharp price point. This is a unique and differentiated platform in just in time for the spring season. In big ticket, our entire trail assortment over the $1,000 price point is unique and exclusive to Tractor Supply. Across specifications and features, our trailer offerings are designed to support our customers' lifestyle. Across our categories, we have a long history of test and learn, and we're excited about the expansion of several recent programs. After a very successful rollout to our Project Fusion stores YETI will be expanded to nearly half of the chain by Q2 and rolled out to the balance of the chain by year-end. Another great example is Solo stove, a high-quality outdoor wood burning fire pit that is a perfect fit for the outdoor enthusiasts in our customers. Given our customers' response to this product, we'll be expanding the top-selling SKUs of Solo stove to more than 1,500 stores with the complete offering available online.\nWeber Grills is another leading brand that we're excited to pilot in 2024 after growing significantly our grills business over the last 3 years. The introduction of Weber positions us to expand our Grill lineup and continue to grow our market share in this rapidly growing category. Weber has long been one of America's leading barbecue grill brands and their products are highly complementary to our existing offering of Pit box, even ambers and Blackstone grill. We're also excited about the newness being introduced in companion animal in the first quarter. First up is the relaunch of our MuttNation partnership with Miranda Lambert. Tractor Supply is the pet wellness destination out here, and we're introducing market-leading new brands like Native Pet and expanding our 4health exclusive brand supplement assortment and our continued pursuit of taking market share, we're introducing new national brands also across cat food.\nWe have new brands like Triumph, [indiscernible] feed and a continued focus on organic feeds across our large animal and poultry categories. And we're also expanding our dear wildlife sets to support our customers' hobby of cultivating feeding and watching their dear. We will continue to leverage our strong portfolio of exclusive brands to grow market share and offer great value. For instance, we're launching Groundworks bag garden and potting soil at compelling price points to the leading national brands, and we'll be introducing Blue Mountain Tech with performance fabrication to appeal to our millennial customers. These are just 2 examples of the strong pipeline we have for newness in our exclusive brands, which represent nearly 30% of our sales.\nAnd finally, it wouldn't be spring at Tractor Supply without the launch of our annual Chick Days. The arrival of Chicks at our stores is a sure sign of spring and creates strong retail theater in our stores. Our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for. Poultry now rivals livestock and line in size of our business. Recent trends have supported growth from existing customers, coupled with robust growth from new customers in the category and this is driving both trips and ticket to our stores. One exciting aspect of the new customers of the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our new unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. We're introducing impeccable a new exclusive brand at Chick Day with a poultry starter kit, poultry treats and even chick toys.\nChick Day is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and we use this as a resource for all things related to home setting beyond poultry to expand them to categories like gardening. I hope you get a chance to experience the event in our stores. To wrap up, our customers continue to trust us for everything they need to care for their pets and animals, tend to their homes, farms and land, enjoy the great outdoors and generally just the live life out here. That purpose serving those who live life out here, drive meaning in what we do each day. Our future remains as bright as it ever has been. Thank you to our team members for your dedication at Tractor Supply and passion for serving our customers and to our customers for trusting us as your go-to supplier for life out here and to our 2,400 communities across Tractor Supply and Petsense for embracing us as part of the fabric of the communities we call home.\nOver time and over various cycles, I stand by the best 3 words to describe Tractor Supply are consistent, reliable and sustainable. These attributes allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. Here's to the next 85 years of serving life out here. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

Entering the third quarter, we had a sharp focus on the impact of the evolving macro environment and the impact of that environment on our customers' retail spending patterns. Despite this view, our quarter was more challenging than we initially expected. The primary drivers of our underperformance were less-than-ideal weather conditions as well as our customers continuing to be discerning with their spending.\nOn the weather impact for the quarter. As we shared in our July earnings call, we anticipated that our compares would ease through the quarter as we were lapping one of the worst droughts in a decade. We were not assuming a significant benefit from the weather, but rather that it would not continue to be a drag on our performance. In fact, it was a drag. We estimate that the unfavorable weather conditions in the third quarter contributed more than 1 point of comp to our sales shortfall compared to our expectations.\nWhile we never like to call out the adverse impacts of the weather on our business, there is no doubt that the challenging conditions continued to weigh on our sales this year as it relates to weather.\nIn Q3, we had extreme heat and drought in [ Texahoma ] and, to a lesser degree, the Midwest, and also we had excessive rainfall and the absence of cool weather in other areas like the Northeast. As an example, [ Texahoma ], which makes up a little over 15% of our sales, we saw extreme temperatures and dryness there for most of the quarter. In fact, Austin, Texas, as an example, there were 44 consecutive days of temperatures over 100 degrees in the third quarter. And for perspective, this was twice as many as Q3 of last year.\nAdditionally, last year in the third quarter, we benefited from both the emergency response from Hurricane Ian and a shift of cooler fall temperatures in the last few weeks of the quarter in some of our markets. This year, we did not have these events working in our favor. In the quarter, the emergency response from Hurricane Adelia was much smaller than the prior year and a wave of summer-like temperature continued into September and, in fact, even now into late October.\nTurning to the macro environment. As we shared last quarter, we believe that due to the cumulative effects of many factors, our customers are showing signs of strength. Examples of these factors include inflation, higher credit card balances and the resumption of school loan payments. Additionally, consumers continue to shift their spending from goods to services, reverting back to pre-pandemic levels. In the context of this shift, though, we believe that they remain more committed to the Out Here lifestyle and that our business is stickier than more discretionary components of retail. But nonetheless, to some degree, we've been affected by this shift.\nNow turning to the numbers for the third quarter. The team delivered net sales growth of 4.3% with a modest comparable sales decrease of 0.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.33, an increase of 11% over the prior year.\nNow let's shift to some highlights for the quarter. Comp transactions were flat to the prior year, offset by an average ticket decline of 0.3%. The average ticket performance was driven by a decline in units per transaction with average unit retail remaining relatively strong. July was our best performing period of the quarter with positive comps. Both August and September comps were negative given the seasonal trends I mentioned earlier.\nImportantly, our active customer counts are stable and growing low single digits. Also importantly, our reactivated as well as new customer counts are also both positive and growing. E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits with strong conversion performance. Our Buy Online, Deliver from Store program was up over 80%. And on a rolling 12-month basis, very notably, our digital sales have now surpassed $1 billion.\nOur consumable, usable and edible products represented a meaningful portion of our business in the quarter, and these businesses continue to outperform our overall sales comp results with continued strength in categories like dry dog food, cat food, poultry feed, lubricants and shavings, just to name a few. CUE continues to be one of our structural advantages and these categories and products represent the strength of our core business, and they are what drives footsteps into our store.\nThe gains in these categories were offset by declines in our late spring/summer seasonal product and big ticket categories as well as softness in demand for those fall/winter product categories that usually begin to see some growth at the end of the quarter due to the unseasonably warm weather. Big ticket performance remained under pressure, down in the mid-single digits, which was a slight improvement from the first half of the year. If I step back, overall, though, we continue to gain share across categories online and in-store and continue, as I said earlier, to see strong customer trends.\nOn the customer front, our Neighbor's Club membership base represented more than 77% of our sales for the quarter. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates have never been higher, and our Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall sales performance. And importantly, our high-value customers again reached another record count in the quarter.\nIn just over a year since launching Neighbor's Club at Petsense, penetration of sales to our members now stands at over 65%, and we continue to benefit from the cross-shopping between the 2 brands as we grow our share of wallet with these customers and focus on Pets Out Here in our collaboration between the 2 brands.\nA couple of trends that I mentioned last quarter did continue into this quarter, and those are, one, customers are continuing to increase in their usage of credit; and two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in lower-income customer cohorts. Importantly, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit another new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team and they continue to do a fantastic job providing best-in-class customer service, a hallmark of Tractor Supply. Through the third quarter, our customer satisfaction scores have increased and experienced an improvement every week year-over-year since 2021.\nWe've made significant progress in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have just over 35% of our chain or 780 stores that are in the Project Fusion layout, and our Garden Center transformation is now active in over 420 locations. We continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial returns of the store-level investments.\nOur Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition remains on track with nearly 50 stores converted to the Tractor Supply brand. And during the quarter, we completed the sale of the Orscheln store support center and the distribution center as planned. Year-to-date, we've opened 51 new Tractor Supply stores in 10 set locations. Our team has done an excellent job executing our real estate projects this year and getting us back to a normalized cadence of new store openings in spite of a tough backdrop in the broader construction market.\nDuring the quarter, the real estate team also successfully executed our first sale-leaseback transaction with the sale of 10 stores. In addition, the team has about 35 fee development sites in the works. I anticipate our real estate strategy will continue to be a source of increasing strength for Tractor Supply over the next few years.\nGiven our performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our sales and earnings guidance for 2023, and Kurt will share some more details on our outlook later in the call.\nBefore I hand it over to Kurt, if I just step back for a moment, if you told me in January of 2020 that we would nearly double our top line sales and earnings and deliver strong cash return to shareholders while increasing our capital investment and growth initiatives and investing in team member wages and investing in brand building, and doing all this through a global pandemic, major disruptions in global supply chains, rapidly changing consumer shifts, also rapidly escalating costs including the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, it would have been hard to imagine.\nBut that's exactly what this team has delivered. Over the last 4 years, we've added $7 billion in incremental sales. We've grown our market share significantly and we've increased our earnings by 115% and returned over $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders. Our resilient needs-based business model has a proven history of growing through various economic conditions.\nOur customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers are owners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We believe that the softness we're seeing is unique to transitory conditions and weather and consumer spending patterns. We continue to have a long-term structural macro trends that are favorable and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial competitive advantages.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Hal and hello to everyone on the call. There are 3 key observations about our business that build on Hal's comments that I'd like to share before diving into the quarterly results.\nFirst, looking at the impact of weather. There are some years weather works to our favor and others where it clearly works against us. We've certainly tried to be transparent over the years as to the impact from the volatility related to weather, both in favorable and unfavorable events. No doubt, 2023 will be a year where weather goes down as unfavorable for our business. From a warm January, a late start to the spring that never materialized over most of our markets to a hot and dry summer across major markets like Texahoma and the Midwest, our seasonal businesses have been under pressure all year.\nSecond, our execution continues to be strong. Our Life Out Here initiatives are performing well and are positively impacting our results. Neighbor's Club, Project Fusion and Garden Centers, pet and digital initiatives are all driving top line growth.\nThird, we view the softness in our customers' retail spending to be unique to the macro challenges in the current environment. Our customer engagement is strong and our initiatives are driving positive results. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth but we will be agile as we navigate the current environment. We are committed to continuing our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nNow turning to our third quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, the team managed the environment well, controlling what we can control. We also remain steadfast in our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. Our third quarter top line results were driven by strong and consistent Q growth, offset by below-trend seasonal performance on a weak summer demand and the lack of early fall seasonal sales, and discretionary big-ticket sales remained under pressure.\nOur comparable store sales growth was solid in regions such as the Southeast and the Far West. The performance of these geo regions was offset by pressure in Texahoma and the Midwest, where heat and drought trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand as well as the warm start to the fall in the Northern markets. Comparable transactions were flat for the quarter with growth in our core year-round categories being offset by reduced demand for our seasonal categories.\nWe had a modest decline in the average comp ticket. Our average unit retail was up 3% to 4%. The benefit of the growth in our average unit retail was offset by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, we continue to experience softer sales in discretionary and impulse add-on items, putting pressure on the average units per transaction.\nMoving down our income statement. Our gross profit increased 7.3% to $1.25 billion. Gross margin increased 101 basis points to 36.7% and 35.6% in the prior year's third quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of everyday low price strategy.\nAt a time when the overall promotional environment across retail has picked up modestly, our large and robust membership of Neighbor's Club offers us a great way to provide value. Our loyalty program allows us, together with our vendors, to strategically target value propositions for our customers.\nThe gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margins given the strength in Q. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carried a lower gross margin rate.\nAs a percent of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 38 basis points to 26.7%. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales. Additionally, consistent with last quarter, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. We have made adjustments to our benefits program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the planned sale leaseback of 10 Tractor Supply store locations, benefiting SG&A by approximately 70 basis points net of transaction and repair costs. Additionally, the increase in SG&A was partially offset by a onetime benefit to depreciation expense of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million pretax. This benefit is attributed to a change in the useful lives of assets for certain remodeled stores due to a reassessment of lease terms to better represent the economic profile of these investments.\nAs I reflect on the SG&A performance overall, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that our operations team did a great job scaling our core variable cost to our sales performance. Our distribution center teams achieved some of the best cut times, fill rates and overall productivity measures in years, and our store teams did a great job balancing store payroll to scale back while also maintaining the right level of customer support and driving our best-in-class customer satisfaction scores.\nOverall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core variable costs well in this environment. As an example, to further illustrate, nearly 85% of our core SG&A dollar growth year-over-year represents investments in our strategic growth initiatives. My appreciation goes out to the team for controlling what we could control. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 10%, a 62 basis point improvement from the prior year.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat to the prior year on a per store basis. We are managing it closely and continue to be very pleased with the quality and position of our inventory. Our in-stock rates are the best they've been in over 2 years. In addition, our inventory shrink improved year-over-year. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. Our long-term debt has no nearing maturities and is fixed at very attractive rates.\nNow let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.6 billion and comp store sales even with last year. Our full year operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.2% with net income of $1.1 billion to $1.11 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.10. This includes a net after-tax benefit of about $0.08 in Q4 for our remaining sale-leaseback transactions this year.\nWe continue to forecast anticipated capital expenditures for the year in the range of $800 million to $850 million or about $725 million to $775 million net of our capital needs for the fixed fee real estate strategy that we shared last quarter. This higher level reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It's important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our owned stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position.\nImplied in our outlook is for fourth quarter comp store sales to be down low to mid-single digits. As Hal mentioned, we anticipate continued discerning consumer spending and unfavorable compares relating to weather as we experienced the ongoing El Nino pattern combined with the cycling of last year's monumental winter storm, which drove 200 basis points of favorable impact on comps. We anticipate continued strength in our core year-round categories, yet the softness in demand for seasonal and discretionary will continue to limit the top side on our performance.\nAs a reminder, we are also lapping the 53rd week, which included an extra week of sales in the prior year, contributing approximately $225 million to top line sales and $0.16 of diluted earnings per share. As for retail price increases, our plans reflect a continued moderation of inflation. While still positive, we believe it will be modest.\nOur guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion year-over-year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and our new distribution center along with some pressure from an unfavorable product mix. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued SG&A deleverage given our investments and the expected comparable store sales declines.\nAs we shared last quarter, for modeling purposes, the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024 based on when the store is converted to our point-of-sale system. Most stores converted to our point of sale during Q2 and Q3 of this year. As is customary, we will provide our guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We're still finalizing our outlook for sales as there are a number of puts and takes to be considered.\nLet's start with the fact that we're a needs-based, demand-driven business with a long history of positive comps. Additionally, as we see 2024 today, we expect we'll have less benefit from inflation, but we're 18 months into cycling big ticket softness. And the weather hopefully cannot be worse than it was this year, but we do anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging with a higher-than-normal degree of uncertainty and ongoing pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets.\nAs we've shared over the last couple of years, we've always planned that 2023 would be our peak capital investment level. With that as a backdrop, we plan to prudently invest in our strategic priorities in 2024 with next year's net capital spending in the 600s, which will relieve some depreciation expense. .\nWe remain excited about the progress on our Life Out Here strategy and are very pleased with our initiatives. Our tenth distribution center will open during the second quarter of 2024. Much like our distribution center opening this year, this new DC benefits gross margin but will pressure our SG&A as the facility ramps up. The gross margin benefits typically lack the opening by about 1 quarter. Similar to 2023, we anticipate executing approximately 15 existing store sale-leaseback transaction in 2024 to fund the own development new store program. And we anticipate the opening of 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 Petsense locations.\nOver our history, we have continually adapted to the operating environment around us. The needs-based, demand-driven characteristics of our product offerings support our ability to continue to be a winner in retail. We will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well, all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy.\nNow I will turn the call over to Hal to wrap this up.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. As the calendar shift to the fall and winter season, our stores and online are ready for the change of typical Tractor Supply fashion. Our merchandising team has been working closely with our vendors on plans for the holiday season with an emphasis on new products and innovation and, very notably, with a focus on value.\nAs the largest player in our sector, it is our obligation to be the advocate for value for our customers, and we are working hard to roll back the cost absorbed over the past 2 years. We will continue to be the destination for value and quality across our merchandising lineup.\nIn key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value, including exciting programs such as Columbia Performance honey gear and our line of [ Grand Teton ] pellet stopes. In our CUE categories, we have the right selection at the right price with a focus on value and are committed to being in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles. For example, you will see wood pallet stackouts in the majority of our stores in preparation for the winter season.\nAnd right now, our 400-plus Garden Centers are showcasing pumpkins and fall harvest decor. And this year, we expanded our Halloween and Harvest decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love for decorating their homes with on-trend seasonal indoor and outdoor decor, including a skeleton cow that was a TikTok viral sensation.\nAdditionally, and particularly in light of the continued warmer weather, we continue to be the destination for our customers' sporting goods, outdoor recreation and outdoor wildlife interest with products like our exclusive Royal Wing Bird Sea, Cannon Gun safe, exclusive countyline log splitters and the Blackstone griddle. Earlier this week, we announced the addition of YETI products to our lineup in our Fusion stores. We're especially excited to collaborate with a well-regarded brand like YETI that brings a long-standing reputation for quality and durability and aligns with our customers' interest in camping, fishing, hunting and all outdoor activities.\nOur stores and Garden Centers will soon be filled with Christmas trees, reeds and poinsettias. In addition to live goods, our customers can look forward to unique and different decor items, including our popular 6-foot chicken law and decorations and farm-themed Holiday Gingerbread kit. When it comes to gifts, we have compelling values and buys in every selection of our store from tools and grills to even fun rural unique items like a 12-volt zero-turn ride-on toy lawnmower.\nFrom a calendar perspective, it's a good setup this year with 31 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And Christmas falls on a Monday, so we anticipate a strong full weekend of sales prior to Christmas. We have a strong holiday season playbook with an exciting day after Thanksgiving Day plan as well with compelling offers programmed throughout the season. To plan for the season, though, we acknowledge there is a broader range of estimates for holiday consumer spending than we've seen over the last couple of years.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve several milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. Notably, we anticipate ending the year with 40% of our store base in the Project Fusion format and nearly 500 Garden Centers, both significant milestones to initiatives that we began less than 3 years ago. Our real estate pipeline is robust with plans for 80 new Tractor Supply stores also in 2024.\nWe're piloting artificial intelligence in many functions in the business, including marketing, supply chain and technology development. And one particular application that I'm very excited about is our generative AI knowledge tool that we call [ Hey ]. Using a proprietary AI engine that we built, we're able to deliver knowledge directly to our team members through the headsets that each wear to augment their individual experience.\nAnd let me give you an example of this. One of the questions recently asked by a team member is, when do you switch from crumble feed to pellet for baby chicks? When asked the, [ Hey ] app response-ed, \"Typically, chicken switch from crumble to pellet feed when they reach about 15 to 18 weeks of age depending on breed and development.\" To date, the results have been excellent. Our team members are really embracing and excited about the technology, and it's been a great value-add feature for our leading customer service.\nWe have a long track record of growth and high expectations or performance. We view our current trends to these expectations as transitory and specific to the economic environment. This team has dialed in and understands the challenges. As we're entering one of the busiest periods in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation goes out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value.\nAnd with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As always, I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000-plus Tractor Supply team members to their commitment to each other and our customers and for their dedication to serving life out here.\nAnd this quarter, I'd like to give a special shout out to our technology team. We did a tremendous job recovering our business from the CrowdStrike outage without a material impact.\nSo let's start with the operating environment for our business before I discuss our second quarter results. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators that we all follow continue to be rather mixed for the consumer in the second quarter. While in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year, I would characterize the health of the consumer is modestly more cautious than last quarter, but certainly still within the range of our forecast at the beginning of the year.\nConsumer spending on goods appears to be fatigue across income cohorts. While we've seen improvement in the consumer inflation rate, unemployment has ticked upwards to the highest rate since late 2021. Additionally, consumer sentiment and consumer confidence are both subdued and the consumer spending landscape continues to be rather choppy.\nAdditionally, in the recent personal consumption expenditures report, we saw another soft month for goods. While in line with our expectations, the ongoing shift of spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business, the mix of goods as a share of PCE is still about 90 basis points above the average.\nAs it relates to retail sales for the second quarter, U.S. retail was flat to modestly positive with growth in nondurable category, which was in line with our performance as a company. And in the farm and ranch channel, we estimate that, that channel experienced mid-single-digit decline, which is indicative of our continued share gains in the channel.\nWith that said, our business for the first half of 2024 has performed right down the middle of our guidance. For instance, half of the month of the year have had positive comp sales and our year-to-date comp sales are up about 0.2%. And overall, our profitability is also right in line with our expectations, and the team has continued to manage our business exceptionally well.\nAs we look at our business in half and reflect back on the spring season, as we always talk about, weather can certainly shift sales between quarters. And given this year, the early Easter and then the couple of weeks of warm weather that we had there in late March, we estimate a potential pull forward of $15 million to $20 million in sales from the first quarter -- from the second quarter into the first quarter.\nAnd so if you think about this kind of balances out our performance across the 2 quarters. And additionally, we thought we'd have some potential for an elongated spring, particularly in late June, but that did not materialize.\nOn the customer front, of note, we did see our higher income customers moderate just modestly as spending for vacation travel has surged for this group. And conversely, though, our lower-income customer cohort moderated up sequentially from the first quarter.\nAnd net-net, our overall customer base though continues to grow and be very strong.\nNow let's shift to some performance highlights for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.5% with a comparable store sales decline of 0.5%. Diluted EPS was $3.93. Our comparable store sales performance was driven by a modest transaction decline of 0.6% with our average ticket coming in at 0.1% positive.\nAs we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in line with our full year guidance. As we move through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first quarter continued to play out.\nImportantly, we continue to see healthy customer engagement. The investments we've made in Neighbor's Club, our world-class loyalty program, our competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in both customer count and customer retention.\nIf you recall, in the first quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offerings. The changes were implemented with the goal to have members receiver work faster and lower the spending required for CUE qualifications.\nThis quarter, as part of our ongoing and continued improvements in the program, we launched Hometown Hero, which recognizes military service members, veterans and first responders. And this program brings together under 1 banner our long-standing support for the selfless men and women who serve America.\nA highlight of the program is that our Hometown Heroes received the highest level status and benefits of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And while still very early, we're pleased with the enrollment.\nOf note, about 20% of our Hometown Heroes to date are new to Neighbor's Club and about 15% are new to Tractor Supply. Once again, our Neighbor's Club comp sales outpaced our overall sales growth. At the same time, we also reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and record membership of more than 36 million members and that means we've added nearly 5 million members over the last 12 months.\nAnd our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. At the same time, though, we are seeing a slight disengagement of our noncore customers. It's down just modestly.\nWe believe this is attributable to the overall macro headwinds that I mentioned in my opening remarks, and given that this customer is not as highly engaged in the kind of life out her lifestyle, our belief is that this customer cohort is a little sluggish or fatigue given the duration of inflation and higher cost of living since 2022 and just being judicious in their spend.\nAnd as we look forward, though, our Neighbor's Club is laser-focused on this opportunity as we improve our personalization capabilities, particularly with our customer data platform that we'll be implementing later in the year.\nOur customer service scores continue to run at all come high with improvements every week for more than 2.5 years. Customer service is a consistent differentiator for Tractor Supply and our commitment to excellence in customer service and the investments we've made in training, tools and technology are really paying off with our customer.\nAnd these efforts have also, though, received national recognition by various third parties, including USA Today and Forbes. Also, it's worth noting that the team received a CIO 100 award recently for our groundbreaking work to utilize AI to enhance the customer experience in our stores. Just a great job by everyone around in our customer service.\nMoving to category performance. I'll highlight was the strong positive comps in big ticket items in the second quarter, notably in categories like writing lawmowers, recreational vehicles and sporting goods.\nAnd the commonality in this categories with strong innovation and newness, and our customers really responded to this. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our live goods performance, which comps well above the chain average despite the hot weather that impacted many of other seasonal categories.\nAs we shared last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable and edible products would run modestly below the chain average in the second quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail.\nWe once again grew units in these categories, and we believe we're continuing to gain market share. The need-based demand-driven nature of our product categories -- these product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business.\nClicking down into our key category. In pet food, recent industry data suggests that the overall category was flat to negative in Q2. As it relates to our business, we continue to take share, but we have seen growth continue to moderate as the category disinflate and pet ownership trends remain soft.\nOur customers' shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated. We offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across national and exclusive brands in a pet friendly environment, which now includes more than 900 Pet Wash locations.\nThrough the second quarter, we've had strong double-digit growth in our Pet Wash service. Additionally, the value of our mobile pet vet clinic is another great gateway for pet customers to find Tractor Supply.\nYear-to-date, we also have seen mid double-digit growth rates in visits to our clinics offered across more than 1,600 stores. The 2 of these in combination with the rest of our services and product benefits creates a great opportunity to reinforce our value proposition.\nAdditionally, pet ownerships benefit from the one-stop shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular, from the cross purchasing synergy with animal feed. As we've mentioned, the vast majority of our customers have both an animal and a pet.\nIn aqua and livestock and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While our average unit retails were down mid- to high single digits in this category in Q2; conversely, we had strong mid-single-digit unit growth across all 3 pieces.\nAs large animal counts continue to pressure, we are certainly a share winner in the large animal categories with our strong unit growth. And in poultry, our annual Spring Chick Days was another positive highlight in the quarter. The event builds on our reputation of the destination for backyard enthusiasts from to organic feed as well as our assortment of premium breads, our lineup continues to resonate with our customers.\nMuch like the first quarter, categories have performed below our comp sales. We're in our discretionary businesses such as clothing, footwear and decor and also in the hardline product for the business, such as things like ag fencing and pet kennels.\nOur digital sales continued to trend from last quarter of double-digit growth. We've accelerated our digital capabilities, and that's fueling engaged with our customers and also improving our conversion rate.\nOur tenth and largest distribution center in Arkansas opened during the second quarter. The start-up of the distribution center was right on schedule and shifting last month. It was a great job by the team.\nOnce again, we are capitalizing on the opportunity to realign with store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity while improving service levels to our store.\nOur supply case investments over the last 4 years have provided us with a structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in\nOur garden centers had strong performance during the important second quarter. We now have more than 500 garden centers across the chain. The merchants did a great job with a differentiated assortment and strong in stocks on top of the planting season. With more brought in live goods as well as adjacent categories catering to outdoor living, we saw the customer respond positively to this multiyear growth driver.\nWe opened 21 new track supply stores and 3 pet track supplies in the quarter. Our new store productivity continues to perform very well. In a year since announcing our expanded real estate capabilities, allowing for own development, we continue to anticipate material benefits to both revenue growth and operating margin rate.\nOur team has built out capabilities to allow us to scale this initiative. We now have nearly 50% of our pipeline in own development with our first locations already opened. This development allows us to have rate reductions of 15% or more compared to our traditional build-to-suit. And we continue to believe that we have a robust pipeline of low-risk organic growth opportunities ahead of us.\nTo wrap up, I believe the team is pleased, but not satisfied with our first half performance. We set high expectations for ourselves. Customer trends are relatively in line with our expectations. The team is executing well.\nIn typical Tractor Supply fashion, we are effectively managing the factors that we can control and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. As we plan for the second half of the year, we anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as is typical an election year.\nAt the halfway point of the year, we are narrowing our guidance for fiscal 2024 to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the second half of the year. We continue to create more separation between us and our competition thanks to our team members and the meaningful relationships they have with our customers in combination with our strategic initiatives. Our dedication to serving life value remains unwavering. We will always strive to do the right thing.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Kurt.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. In many ways, our second quarter top line results were consistent with the results in the first quarter, with solid seasonal growth and exceptional big-ticket sales, while our year-round discretionary categories remain pressured.\nAs we expected, key performance was slightly below the chain average, given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing.\nRetail price deflation, which was just over 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in CUE as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter.\nOur comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain, within a range of down 2% to up 2%. The strongest regional performance was in the Northeast and Commonwealth due to easier compares and better overall weather compared to last year.\nThis strength was offset by pressure in the Far West and for the exact opposite reasons as they had tougher compares and less-than-ideal weather conditions this quarter. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%.\nAs Hal mentioned, we believe April was negatively impacted by the pull forward of Easter into the first quarter as well as a slow start to the spring season.\nMoving down our income statement. Our gross margin increased 43 basis points to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an everyday low price strategy.\nThese improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below chain average margins. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 58 basis points to 23.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation and amortization as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs, given the decline in comparable store sales.\nThese factors were partially offset by productivity improvements and strong cost control. During the quarter, our ongoing sale leaseback strategy benefited SG&A by approximately $5 million, net of transaction and repair costs from the sale of 2 Tractor Supply locations. This transaction and the related benefit represent timing shift out of the third quarter and into Q2.\nFor the quarter, operating profit margin was 13.2%. We had strong cost control as evidenced by our underlying operating profit margin that was essentially flat with prior year. Diluted EPS was $3.93 compared to $3.83 last year.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of 10.2% in average inventory per store, as we improved our in-stock position in Q and invested in big ticket given its strength. Our in-stocks are up nearly 4 points to our best level since before the pandemic.\nWe are pleased with the quality of our inventory, as we enter the second half of the year. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million of capital to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends.\nNow let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Given our performance in the first half of the year and our forecast for the balance of the year, we believe it's now appropriate to narrow our guidance range.\nFor the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $15 billion with comp store sales in the range of down 0.5 point to up 1%. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 9.8% to 10.1% with net income of $1.08 billion to $1.12 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.40.\nAs to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarter, let me share with you a bit more of how we are thinking about the various scenarios. We are approaching the back half with balanced optimism. We are forecasting comp sales in the third quarter to be within a tight band of scenarios and generally similar to the first half of the year.\nThe shift of the season doesn't occur until late in the third quarter, and we don't begin to lap the deflationary effect of feed until the fourth quarter. The only meaningful swing factor in Q3 tends to be weather, particularly large storms, which produce emergency response activity.\nWe see the fourth quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes. For our base case, we do anticipate stronger growth in the fourth quarter, given the easier compares, while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending.\nOn the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter; lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023; and the potential for greater emergency response activity.\nNow on the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the federal election and a shorter holiday selling season with 5 less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\nAs for the retail price, our plans continue to reflect a headwind from deflation in the third quarter with a moderation towards neutral in the fourth quarter as we start to lap the lower cost, which began in late Q3 of last year.\nOur guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. The third quarter is expected to have our best gross margin expansion as we anticipate transportation costs will remain favorable.\nIn the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult comparison with 129 basis points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiatives.\nAs a result, we are forecasting our fourth quarter gross margin rate consistent with the prior year. I view our gross margin performance as strong in this current environment.\nMoving on to SG&A. For the second half of the year, there are a couple of items I would highlight for our expectations, especially for the third quarter. First, please keep in mind that we are lapping last year's depreciation benefit of 35 basis points or $0.08 per share in the third quarter.\nSecond, given our comp sales outlook specific to the third quarter, we anticipate modest fixed cost deleverage. And third, we will continue to see pressure from the start-up cost of the new distribution center in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. Thus, our SG&A performance will be the softest in the third quarter with more modest deleverage in the fourth quarter.\nIn total, we remain on track for the benefits of our sale leasebacks to be relatively consistent with last year's, albeit with a slight variation by quarter due to the timing shift of 2 stores into the second quarter. We continue to forecast the return of capital to shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term.\nAt Tractor Supply, we believe in playing offense. This is a team that will stay on offense and continue to invest for the long term. We are excited about our Life Out Here strategy progress, our leadership position in the industry and our ability to build on our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap up.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. Despite the temporary softness in our channel, structural elements remain very attractive for Tractor Supply. We have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiative, our market being a beneficiary of continued net rural migration, high-return new store growth opportunities and ongoing share gains. .\nTractor Supply is extremely well positioned as the leader in a large, fragmented market. Before we go into Q&A session, I'd like to wrap up with 3 comments.\nOne. As we head into the back half of the year, I am very excited about our robust innovation pipeline, the compelling value we have in our market and our new brand launches. We just set our annual beer event and Halloween decor program and both are off to a strong start. In pet, we have a number of upcoming activities, including our expanded pet appreciation month, a new lineup for Mont Nation by Miranda Lambert and an expansion of 4 Health, our exclusive brand, premium dog food.\nAdditionally, we have an exciting new endcap program as well as new center court and dry all events that are focused on compelling value that are core to our lifestyle.\nThe second comment I'd have is that we continue to believe that as and when economic conditions become more neutral for us that we will return to our long-term algorithm. As mentioned, there's really 2 economic conditions that are impacting us the most. The first is the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the second is deflation.\nWe believe both of these are transitory, and we don't need them to improve, but rather just do normalize for us to return to our long-term algorithm. And the third comment is that the team is playing offense. And we're not only executing our existing initiatives, but working -- but we're working on plans for the back half of the decade and working on our next growth drivers of our Life Out Here strategy. Tractor Supply does not lack for opportunities, and we believe we have multiple new opportunities that could expand on our $180 billion total addressable market.\nI'm very excited to share more detail of the next drivers of our strategy in the near future. Our stores and online are ready for the change of seasons as we ended the third quarter. Tractor Supply is well prepared to meet the needs and expectations of our customers.\nWe've invested in our store base, in inventory, in our supply chain, in our digital capabilities and customer service to ensure that we can deliver on our promise of providing the best products and solutions for Life Out Here.\nWe've also enhanced our Neighbor's Club to provide more benefits and rewards to our loyal customers. We're excited about the upcoming events and promotions that will showcase our unique and differentiated seasonal assortment of merchandise, and we expect to see continued improvements across our categories.\nTo conclude, I'm incredibly proud of our team. Throughout our 85-plus-year history, no matter what issue we faced, our team members have always come together. We have unique and special culture. It's our special soft and key differentiator, and it's what gives me great confidence in the future of Tractor Supply.\nAnd with that, let's open up the call for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the 52,000 Tractor Supply members for their commitment to each other and our customers and for their dedication to serving Life Out Here. Team is executing at a high level and did a nice job nimbly adjusting in the second quarter.\nWe're operating in a tougher environment than we expected at the beginning of the quarter and certainly tougher than what we forecasted as we entered the year. Consumer spending continues to shift in favor of services. Shoppers that are tired of inflation are being judicious on their baskets. Consumers continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. And additionally, our business was further impacted by the abnormal seasonal trends, particularly in the month of June.\nDespite this environment, we still expect 2023 to be a pretty solid year. Our customer is healthy, and we're gaining share, outgrowing our market by 2x and we are significantly outpacing total U.S. retail sales growth. We anticipate that we will have positive sales comps and positive comp transactions for the year, albeit in the low single digits range. And importantly, net sales and earnings will grow strong mid-single digits on top of the 53rd week last year.\nWe have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our underperformance to these expectations as specific to the current environment. The team has dialed in and understands the challenges.\nFor the remainder of the call today, I'll speak to a few highlights of the second quarter and then share an update on our Life Out Here strategy. John Ordus will then provide greater insights on our real estate strategy and our plans to accelerate our growth. And then Kurt will follow John and share further details on the second quarter and our full year outlook.\nSo let's begin. All right. Turning to the second quarter. We grew net sales by 7.2% with comparable store sales up 2.5% and diluted EPS $3.83, an increase of nearly 9%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.8% and ticket growth of 0.6%. We expected and were pleased to see comp transactions turn back positive and this trend has continued into Q3.\nWe began the quarter with mid-single-digit comp sales growth in both April and May. As we moved through the month of June, we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our seasonal categories with the period coming in modestly positive. In my 25 years in retail, June was one of the most topsyturvy months that I have seen, smoke, drought, heat, hit had a little bit of it all.\nAs mentioned, our customer base is healthy. Our active customer counts are stable and growing. Importantly, our new customer trends have leveled out after a period of lapping tremendous growth in 2020 and 2021. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to break records and improved year-over-year. And customer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic.\nOur Neighbor's Club reached a record 31 million members in the quarter, an increase of 5 million members in the last year. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates remain at all-time high. Neighbors members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall performance and our high-value members reached a record count in the quarter.\nA few key trend that we're seeing our customers as follows: one, customers are increasing in their usage of credit. Two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in our lower-income customers. And three, customers are buying a little more often but a little less per trip.\nNow shifting from our customer to our categories. Our year-round categories were up mid-single digits, indicative of our ongoing market share gains and our demand-driven need-based business model. Our consumable, usable and edible categories continue to deliver strong stable performance and drive trips to Tractor Supply.\nIn this quarter, CUE categories had growth in the low double digits. In companion animal, we are gaining substantial share throughout the category. Again, this quarter, we had sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week.\nIn livestock, our Spring Chick Days event was one of the largest ever for us with the poultry category up strong double digits. We believe we're on track to exceed last year's record of 11 million birds sold, not only regain growth from existing customers, we are also experiencing robust growth in new customers on the category, and this is driving both trips and ticket.\nOur seasonal categories were flat and below expectations. The miss was primarily in June when, as mentioned previously, there were a number of choppy environmental conditions across our markets that resulted in the consumer not being as engaged in the categories we expected. This softer seasonal performance in June had a material impact on our second quarter performance and was the main driver of our miss versus our expectations.\nOur big ticket sales were down in that high single digits and in line with our expectations. And in fact, our performance in the quarter was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The most significant pressure in the quarter was in zero- turns, generators and recreational vehicles. On the real estate front, we opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and 3 pet by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we've seen the cadence of our new store openings returned to a more normalized rate.\nOur pet Tractor Supply business is performing well and comps in the quarter were greater than over tractor supply. And the integration of Orscheln is right on track. To date, we fully transitioned and regrant opened 15 locations. We remain very pleased with the customers' response as we convert to the Tractor Supply brand.\nAlthough the operating environment may be different than we anticipated as we entered the year, I'm incredibly proud of how the team has come together to navigate the various circumstances and control what we can control.\nNow transitioning to an update on our Life Out Here strategy. We remain very confident in our long-term growth outlook. We participate in a large fragmented and attractive market. We continue to benefit from numerous structural tailwinds, including rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership. We have numerous substantive competitive advantages and are investing to expand them through our Life Out Here strategy.\nSince we first embarked on our strategy in the fall of 2020, the team has made remarkable progress on the transformation of Tractor Supply. As a reminder, the 5 pillars of our strategy include: deliver legendary customer experiences, advance our ONETractor capabilities, operate the Tractor Way, go the country model for our team and generate healthy shareholder turns. And the key initiatives that support this strategy include our Project Fusion store remodels, our Garden Center transformation, our Neighbor's Club loyalty program and the expansion of our omnichannel capabilities.\nOur Project Fusion store layout is now in over 700 stores, representing greater than 30% of our store base. This program is enhancing our space productivity with improved layout, signage, SKU expansions and improved adjacencies. And for remodels, it also offers an improved customer shopping experience that is much more contemporary.\nComplementing Project Fusion is the sideline transformation, which is leveraging and expanding our existing outdoor side lot retail to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a Garden Center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omnichannel technology investments. With more than 400 Garden Centers today, we've significantly expanded our assortment of lawn and garden products that are relevant to our customers' lifestyle.\nImportantly, these 2 projects are delivering on our return expectations. They're providing material lift. We're seeing improvement in customer satisfaction and we're seeing higher levels of new customer acquisition in these remodeled stores. Also, our execution on the remodels continues to improve as we're in year 3 now of the effort, and we're reducing project costs and also continuing to shorten construction times.\nWe relaunched our Neighbor's Club program to a points-based structure in April of 2021 and the timing was very fortuitous as it allowed us to lock in the millions of new customers found us through the pandemic. In total, since the relaunch, our membership has increased by 12 million members, a 60% increase. Additionally, the design of the program has facilitated upward spend migration and driven strong retention rates. Lastly, the program provides invaluable insight into our customer behavior and allowed to personalize our offering tailored to their needs. Look for us to evolve the structure again sometime in the next 12 to 18 months to further enhance value for our members.\nUnderpinning our strategy are substantial investments in our distribution network to support the significant sales increase and store growth. Today, our network is achieving record service levels and the strongest productivity we've experienced in the last 5 years. Our new state-of-the-art distribution center in Novar, Ohio, and our increased count of mixing centers now up to 15 and the implementation of engineered labor standards, are all contributing to this performance.\nToday, I'm excited to share with you a new strategic focus area that we've been working on for a little over a year, the transformation of our real estate model, enabled by a number of new capabilities that is designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin rate and reinforce our long-term guidance.\nFirst, we're raising our new store growth target. We now believe there is a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion of robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores. And we believe we continue to have significant run rate for growth with high return new stores.\nSecond, we're implementing new capabilities to enable owned and development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allowing for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Third, we're also announcing plans to periodically execute sale-leaseback transactions of our existing ownership of 117 stores. And we're going to have a step-up in our ongoing build of stores back to 90 stores per year starting in 2025.\nToday's real estate announcement extends our runway for growth and reinforces our long-term financial model. It's a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John, who can share some more color on our real estate strategy.\n\nJohn P. Ordus\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Stores Officer, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThank you, Hal. It's an exciting time for the store operations in real estate team as we embark on new ways to capture growth and market share while also in efficiencies in our real estate process. Over the last year, we've installed new leadership in our real estate team. This has allowed us to reevaluate where we are in the natural progression of our store growth plans and our ability to leverage our real estate capital structure. This new approach will allow us to realize cost savings and be more nimble with our store portfolio.\nOur strong outlook for new store growth is a direct correlation of the millions of new customers we have acquired and our overall sales performance over the last several years. This provides us with nearly a decade of new store growth in the United States. We believe these are low risk, high return, organic growth opportunities. We anticipate accelerating our new store growth from approximately 70 stores this year to 80 in 2024 and 90 new stores in 2025 and beyond. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply.\nWe continued strong new store productivity metrics with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis and our stores are profitable in year 1. As part of our growth plan, let's start with new stores. We have developed a new sales forecasting model to determine new stores mature sales and pro forma results to develop our total market store growth opportunity of 3,000 stores. This was the first update to our modeling process in 4 years.\nWe have infused the process with a machine learning model and insights from our 31 million Neighbor's Club members. This gives us tremendous confidence to raise our outlook by 200 stores for a total of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the U.S. To capture this growth, the real estate team is ramping up our pipeline to allow us to accelerate our store openings to 90 new stores by 2025. We are on track to open approximately 70 new stores this year with a step up to 80 new stores in 2024. We have a robust pipeline of new stores in our sites over the next 24 months. In fact, our pipeline is at the best level of development is prior to the pandemic.\nThe team is also building new capabilities to optimize our real estate portfolio. For instance, we will start on development of stores this year through a fixed fee developer model and over time, anticipate self-development in new stores. This year, we anticipate 20 to 30 of our new stores will be in our own development pipeline, 2024 new store openings, many of which will begin development in this year.\nA benefit of these lean programs is our ability to have more control and visibility in this development process. The great news is that we estimate these capabilities will result in a 10% to 20% estimated rent reduction as compared to a developer model build. This rent reduction helps us continue to improve our new store returns.\nPart of the investment and creation of this development model requires more upfront cash. It is exciting that we are able to do the sale leaseback of 10 to 15 stores this year out of the 117 stores that we own. Going forward, we plan to use the sale-leaseback program on both existing owned stores as well as new store openings. This program will help fund our planned on store development. It will also capture value in currently owned stores.\nWith nearly 2,200 stores, we are also strategically investing in and optimizing our existing store portfolio as part of the lease renewal cycle. All stores will go through an in-depth review to ensure we have the right real estate strategy in place. We will then take action to ensure that all stores have the right location, size, facility, rent structure and format. These factors are critical to the success of our team and stores to deliver legendary customer service.\nWith that, let me now pass it over to Kurt for our financial review.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. Turning to our second quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, a commended team on how they have remained nimble and steadfast in our commitment to be the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. In many ways, our second quarter top line results were very consistent with our results in the first quarter with strong growth, flattish seasonal performance and a decline in big ticket sales. .\nOur comparable store sales growth was the strongest in the Far West, South Atlantic and Texas, Oklahoma. The strength of these regions was offset by pressure in the Northeast and Midwest regions where seasonal trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand. Comp sales in the quarter benefited by about 5 percentage points from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price increases that put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not lapped as of yet.\nMuch like the first quarter, the benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by the impact of 3 factors: First, the average ticket was impacted by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Second, we also experienced softer sales in discretionary and impulse add-on items. Third, on a positive note, we also saw our customers shopping us more frequently, with a slight reduction in the number of items per basket. Overall, our customers are buying more units or pounds from us in total.\nMoving down to income statement. Our gross profit increased 9.3% to $1.51 billion. Gross margin increased 69 basis points to 36.2% from 35.5% in the prior year's second quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs, driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies of our new distribution center in Novar, Ohio.\nProduct mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate. As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 77 basis points to 22.8%.\nThe increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DTC. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. The growth in medical claims is due to new benefit offerings that had stronger engagement rates than we anticipated as well as higher program costs overall. We have made some adjustments to the program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024.\nApproximately 80% of our SG&A growth year-over-year represents investments for growth, such as new stores, the impact of Orscheln Farm and Home, the new DC and the depreciation from our capital investments for items such as Project Fusion remodels and Garden Center transformations. The core SG&A costs leveraged well even in a low comp sales environment. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our cost to our sales performance.\nFor the quarter, operating profit margin was 13.4%, an 8 basis points decline from the prior year. Consistent with our guidance from the year, Orscheln stores had a modest drag on operating income, principally due to factors unique to the transition. In Q2, we attribute approximately 10 basis points of operating margin decline to activities relating to Orscheln.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $27 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a decrease of 1.7% in average inventory per store. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory we enter the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we strategically issued $750 million in long-term debt, which brings our weighted average fixed rate to 3.4%. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x.\nAt Tractor Supply, we are committed to building on our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our real estate portfolio management is another way that we can continue to facilitate strong returns. Let me shift now to share a few financial highlights as a result of the evolution of our real estate strategy.\nThe sale leaseback of 10 to 15 owned stores is anticipated to close during the second half of the year, resulting in a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share. We are under contract on 10 stores and expect to close on those stores in the third quarter. The expected net gain reflects a selective reinvestment of a small portion of the benefit from the sale back into our store infrastructure this year. For bottoming purposes, the net gains will be recorded in operating income as an offset to SG&A.\nGiven the migration to our new real estate development strategy, we anticipate that we have about a decade of runway from the sale of existing company-owned stores ahead of us. This increases cash flow over the coming years and is a great way for us to lever the strength of our balance sheet. The more efficient owned development program is expected to drive lower new store rent. As the program ramps, these savings are anticipated to more than offset the incremental rent expense from the sale leaseback of existing stores.\nIn 2025 and beyond, the acceleration of our new store growth to about 90 stores annually should help us capture market share and bolster the high end of our long-term guidance ranges. We continue to have very robust new store economics providing us the confidence to make this shift.\nNow let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. At the halfway point of the year, we are now forecasting low single-digit comp sales and mid- to high single-digit earnings growth. We continue to believe this will be a year of solid performance for us as we continue to gain market share and advance our strategic initiatives.\nWe are carefully watching many leading macroeconomic indicators, consumer behavior and retail trends as well as our own insights to assess the health of the consumer. While our customers remain healthy, we are more cautious about their discretionary spending in the second half of the year. At the same time, we are moderating our expectations for the performance of our seasonal categories based on our trends in the first half of the year, that have been choppy lower expectations. We believe it is prudent to recalibrate our expectations for both the discretionary and seasonal categories based on our year-to-date trends.\nFor the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, comp store sales growth of 1.3% to 2.5% growth. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.3% with net income of $1.2 billion to $1.15 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10.20 to $10.40. This includes a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share for the sale-leaseback. We anticipate about $0.15 will be recognized in Q3 and $0.05 in Q4.\nIn the light of the updates to our real estate strategy, anticipated capital expenditures for the year are now forecasted to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million compared to our prior range of $700 million to $775 million. This increase reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It is important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our owned stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position.\nAs to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarters, we continue to believe that comp sales will be stronger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Both quarters are modeled to achieve comp sales growth. Please keep in mind that we are lapping a monumental winter storm in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we estimate contributed 200 basis points to comp sales in the quarter.\nAs for retail price increases, our plans continue to reflect a moderation from the impact of inflation. At the same time, we would anticipate a pickup in our comp transaction growth as we experienced this quarter. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, we anticipate continued benefit from transportation and the new distribution center along some pressure from unfavorable product mix.\nFor the third quarter, our SG&A performance exclusive of the sale leaseback is anticipated to be in line with the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a modest deleverage given the compare in the prior year.\nFor modeling purposes, the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024 based on when the store is converted to our point-of-sale system. We will share more details when we provide our 2024 outlook.\nLooking ahead, we will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well, all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our growth strategy. For Tractor Supply, we expect to end the year in a strong position for the future.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap this up.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. Stepping back, Tractor Supply has achieved remarkable growth over the past few years, and the team has done an excellent job scaling our processes, capabilities and organization to manage this growth. .\nKey operational areas like inventory and payroll grew materially but at a lesser rate than sales and we're always in control. Key philosophies like ELP were reembraced and our marketing media mix shifted fully away from print to digital. And the combination of these 2 enabled our promotional activity to achieve all-time lows, and we remain there.\nIn addition to these efforts, we launched our Life Out Here strategy to continue the ongoing information of our business. This strategy helped lock in new customers, substantiate our market share gains and is a platform for our future growth. The timing could not have been better. At the halfway mark of 2023, it is shaping up to be a solid year for Tractor Supply on top of 3 extraordinary years. Our market is stable and our customers remain healthy. The team is effectively controlling what we control.\nAs we celebrate our 85th anniversary, Tractor Supply remains a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through various economic conditions. As a company, we have a proven ability to manage through dynamic environments, whether that is a macroeconomic or seasonal weather trends. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it. Our customers over-indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. As the market leader, we have substantial advantages that are getting stronger every day.\nAdditionally, investment in our Life Out Here strategy has critical mass. The natural evolution of our real estate strategy is furthering our competitive advantages. We see meaningful growth potential in our markets. I remain extremely confident that we have a tremendous runway of growth ahead of us and with the right team and the right strategy, we're continuing to build a strong foundation for the future.\nWith that, let's open up the call for questions."

Thank you for your time and attention this morning. Now I'll turn the call over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 is off to a solid start with first quarter results in line with our expectations. I would like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. As evidenced by our continuation of record high customer satisfaction scores, the team is always there for our customers as the dependable supplier for life out here.\nBefore I get into our review of the first quarter's results, I want to take a moment to share what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business. In our view, the U.S. economy remains strong. Unemployment continues at a low level, wages are growing at a steady clip. In spite of sticky inflation, consumer spending remains strong, and mobility has slowed as a consequence of a challenging housing market, but that said, we continue to see outsized population growth in rural markets.\nAs it relates to consumer spending, the shift of spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. In the first 2 months of the calendar year, consumer services spending growth was nearly 7%, whereas consumer spending on goods growth was less than 1%. As a result, the mix of goods as a share of PCE are now only 100 basis points above their pre-COVID average. This progressive shift is in line with our expectations as we enter the year.\nAlso, as expected, inflation has remained sticky by outsized increases in shelter, food away from home, energy and insurance. As a consequence, consumers continue to be anxious about inflation, particularly the lower-income consumer.\nIn the first quarter, our upper income consumer over-indexed in big ticket categories and recreational purchases compared to our lower income consumer, who is prioritizing their spend on needs.\nIn our needs-based, consumable, usable and edible categories, we see very little difference in our performance by income cohort. Once again, our business is proving to be durable, stable and very consistent.\nBroadly speaking, in our economy, goods continue to disinflate and are generally running low single digits with some categories having moderate deflation. With the first quarter behind Tractor Supply, we have now successfully lapped our 2 most challenging compares due to the inflationary benefits that we had over the last 18 months that have substantially benefited our top line. We do not see additional downward deflationary pressures in the current environment. The transition from an inflationary cycle to a disinflationary cycle is playing out as we anticipated.\nIn spite of a very challenging housing market, we continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. While rural migration trends have moderated from the recent piece, rural America gained population in 2023. This marks the fourth consecutive year of growth in rural population. It is our view that the sensitive community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price has ensured the rural migration trend is 1 that's here to stay for the time being.\nSo with that, let's now turn to a review of the business for the first quarter. We grew net sales by 2.9%, with comparable store sales up 1.1% and diluted earnings per share up 10.9% to $1.83. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.3% offset by a small decline in average ticket of 0.2%. These results were very much in line with our expectations that we shared with you as we started the quarter and year.\nOverall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Total customer count grew mid-single digits with growth in active, new and reactivated customers as we invested in our Neighbor's Club program and customer service.\nNeighbor's Club continues to represent the majority of our sales. During the quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offering. As our points-based program enters its fourth year, it was appropriate for us to refresh our offering based on insights and customer feedback. The changes we made were all implemented with the goal to have customers receive rewards faster and to lower the spending required for tier qualifications. Our Neighbor's Club members have responded positively to these changes. For example, the new rewards redemption at a $2 and $5 level down from $10 is working as we designed and is driving greater customer engagement and trips for this cohort. The initial response from our customers on the collective changes has been very positive, and we're seeing increased spending across the board.\nIn addition, we continue to improve relevancy to our members through more personalized offers and tailored incentives and experiences based on their interest and shopping patterns. With more than 34 million members, Neighbor's Club should continue to build our customers' loyalty and affinity for Tractor Supply as we go forward.\nOur customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs. This is an area where we have strategically invested in training, compensation, benefits, tools and technology to help elevate our customer service. This has garnered the attention of our customers, and I believe, helps strengthen our scores.\nThe strength of our portfolio of products and shopping missions was evident very much so in the first quarter. We had robust growth in our seasonal categories. Our consumable, usable and edible products performed in line with our chain average. Our performance this quarter was on top of the robust growth we've experienced over the last 4 years as our [indiscernible] customer trends remain strong as we continue to gain market share. Our customers were certainly in the mindset to prepare for spring as we had strong big ticket growth in the mid-single digits and strength in other early spring preparedness categories. Categories that performed below our comp sales growth were more in our discretionary businesses such as clothing and gifts and truck tool and hardware.\nIn our pet food and livestock categories, we continue to grow our market share. In pet food, we've seen growth moderate as the category [ disinflates ] and pet ownership moderates. Our customers' shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated, so we offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across private and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes about 900 Pet Wash locations. Additionally, pet owners benefit from the one-stop shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular, from the cross purchasing synergy with animal and livestock feed.\nIn animal and livestock feed, we offer exclusive brands like [indiscernible] producers pride, along with the national brands from Carina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more. We continue to innovate across our key categories of [indiscernible], cattle and poultry in trends like organic and snack. And we bring a unique retail experience in these categories with events like our annual spring Chick Days. This year, the event is on track to have strong results. We continue to see growth from existing customers who are building out and adding to their flock. Organic feed and our assortment of premium breads continue to lead the category and growth.\nTractor Supply is the destination for [indiscernible] poultry. Today, nearly 2/3 of our backyard chicken owners consider them to be pets, and our customers over-index the poultry ownership with nearly 1 in 5 customers having chickens.\nStepping back, we have a market share of about 20% in bagged livestock feed, and we continue to take share, and we are consistently outperforming the market across our 2 categories. After nearly 2 years of pressure on our big-ticket comps, we were pleased to see big ticket categories turn positive in the quarter. We experienced broad-based strength across seasonal categories, including 0 return tractors, recreational vehicles and outdoor power equipment. Our digital sales returned to double-digit growth in the quarter with increases in visits and an improved conversion rate. Nearly 80% of our orders were they're picked up in store or fulfilled by a store. Almost 20% of our sales came through our mobile app. The team made excellent feature update such as New Express Checkout feature and the addition of estimated delivery times, and these have helped increase our conversion rate.\nThis year, we're opening our tenth and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. The start-up of the distribution center is right on schedule as shipping will begin during June. Once again, we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service our stores all the while allowing us to reduce our freight cost.\nOur supply chain investments over the last 4 years have provided us with material structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in stem miles.\nWe opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and 4 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. As I shared last quarter, 2024 will be the year of the garden center. We're leveraging the change of seasons across the store front as the year shifts to spring. The team has come out of the gate strong to ensure we have a differentiated assortment and availability in time for the planning season. We now have nearly 500 garden centers across the chain. Based on our early read of spring, our expectation is that with more broad than ever and a grower network to support our garden centers, we should see the customer respond positively this multiyear growth driver.\nAt Tractor Supply, we're grounded in our purpose as a company to serve life out here and our deep rooted commitment to our mission and values. We believe in finding meaningful ways to support our core mission. Earlier this week, we issued our fifth annual Stewards of Life out here Tear Sheet that highlights our Stewardship priorities and progress.\nFor all of us at Tractor Supply, we are highly committed to preserving life out here for future generations. We are proud to share our progress towards our ambitious goals.\nIn summary, we're relatively pleased with our start to the year. Customer trends are in line with our expectations. The team is executing very well. We're controlling our controllables and making progress on our [indiscernible] strategy. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me start by building on to Hal's comments about the quarter. Our first quarter performance was right down the middle when compared to our expectations on both the top line and the bottom line. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a very strong January as the month features some spans of brutal cold. While February was warmer than normal and relatively soft, the best way to view the winter season performance is to look at weather categories across January and February combined. And overall, we were pleased with our cold weather category performance. We comped positive in March in spite of a limited arrival of spring across our markets. Where this season had turned to spring, we were very pleased with how the business performed.\nAll geographic regions performed in a tight band for the quarter. Average unit retail was impacted by modest product deflation of about 1% in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the trends we are seeing in unit growth and the underlying share gains in categories where deflation has had an outsized impact to AUR. Our gross margin rate of 36% increased 50 basis points to last year. We were very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs, disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of our everyday low price strategy.\nWe were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets.\nOur first quarter SG&A expense rate, including depreciation and amortization increased 16 basis points to 28.2%. This increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization as well as the modest deleverage of our fixed cost given the level of comparable store sales growth. The leverage from our distribution center productivity gains did partially offset the loss of fixed cost leverage. Excluding depreciation and amortization, SG&A was essentially flat as a percent of sales. This was better performance than we anticipated entering the year as there were approximately $5 million of expenses that we had planned to occur in the first quarter that we now anticipate incurring in the second quarter.\nFrom my perspective, the team did a great job controlling the controllables. Altogether, operating income increased 7%, with operating margin expansion of 34 basis points. Net income increased 8.2% and diluted EPS increased 10.9% to $1.83. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $118.8 million, returning $236.2 million of capital to shareholders. We also increased our dividend by 7%, marking our 15th consecutive year of growing our dividend.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a modest decrease of about 4% in average inventory per store. Lower freight costs was a contributor to the decrease in inventory dollars. Excluding freight and [indiscernible], our comp inventory was up modestly in dollar value and units. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. In our commitment to be the dependable supplier for our customers' lifestyle, we are at the highest in-stock levels since pre-COVID. With strong annualized cash flows and improved working capital, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x.\nAs Hal mentioned, we are reiterating our guidance for 2024. We anticipate this year to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. We continue to expect full year sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and project comparable store sales to be in the range of down 1% to a positive 1.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see second quarter comp sales in line with our full year outlook. Given the trends in our comp sales, our outlook assumes that strength in big ticket and seasonal will continue. We are planning for a modest AUR pressure on Q with positive unit trends.\nOur expectation is that select discretionary categories will remain under pressure. For the second quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in line with the first quarter from continued supply chain efficiencies and benefits from effective cost management, partially offset by the mix impact of growth in big ticket, which runs below the chain average.\nWe anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage from our planned investments including the incremental cost for the opening of our new distribution center.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there's approximately $5 million shifting to the second quarter that we had initially anticipated in the first quarter, including staffing and training costs associated with the opening of the DC. As a result, we expect second quarter operating profit margin to be down slightly compared to prior year.\nAs I shared when we initially provided guidance in February, there are a few factors that will impact operating margin in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to continue to benefit our results in the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3.\nIn regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter.\nTo sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.06 billion to $1.13 billion and diluted earnings per share of $9.85 to $10.50. With the majority of the year still ahead of us, we believe these expectations are still appropriate. We continue to believe that the best way to look at our business is not by the quarters, but by the halves of the year.\nIn this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our [indiscernible] strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal for some final remarks.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. Our Life Out Here strategic priorities are on track and delivering on our expectations. We continue to see fantastic opportunities for growth ahead. In store and online, we're ready for the spring and summer season. Customers are responding positively to our new product assortments from Weber, Toro, YETI and more. We have several product test and learn initiatives in store and online, like Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer.\nAcross companion animal, we're adding to our assortment with new brands like [indiscernible], Real Mesa and Native Pet and expanding our offerings across brands like Carina Pro plants, Sports Mix and Hill's Science Diet. Our garden centers are set to help our customers prepare for their hobbies of gardening, especially with a focus on vegetables and fruit trees and just simply enjoying their property.\nAcross the seasons, we have new product offerings specific to the garden center. We're currently showcasing our roses plant of the month. and are prepared with hanging baskets for Mother's Day. As we move into the second half of the year, we will shift to fall harvest and Halloween and then to Christmas with live goods and decor. Overall, this is a great way for us to track new customers and soften the front of our store.\nAcross the store, we have a tremendous amount of newness for our customers' passions and lifestyles. We also continue to invest in customer service at our stores. In addition to our [indiscernible] service our store team members provide to our customers, we are leveraging AI in our stores and garden centers through our Tractor vision, which uses cameras and computer vision technology to provide data to deploy alerts that help our team members efficiently and effectively staff the store. One scenario where this is incredibly beneficial is when customer traffic is building up at our registers, Tractor Vision will alert team members through their ERP that another team member needs to come up to open another register. We're also leveraging Tractor Vision to monitor our front apron of the store for dwell time. This allows for a team member to better serve our customers particularly in categories like outdoor riding law mowers. These are the types of investments and capabilities that separate us from our farm and ranch competition and really make us a leader in retail.\nIt's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to delivering our mission and values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

    "content": "Half Year 2023 Tesco PLC Earnings Presentation\n\nHalf Year 2023 Tesco PLC Earnings Presentation\n\nTSCOLONDONOCT 5, 4:00 AM\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director, Tesco PLC\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our interim results presentation. I'm joined here in Welwyn by our CFO, Imran Nawaz. This morning, Imran and I will outline a strong first half performance in what is undoubtedly a very challenging market. We've continued to invest for customers and for colleagues at a time when it is most needed. The strategic priorities we first shared with you 1 year ago are serving us well, and I will give you an update on our progress shortly.\nOver the past few years, we have maintained a relentless focus on value. We have further improved our competitiveness, and in doing so, have protected our strong positions in all of our markets. At the same time, we have significantly improved our ability to generate cash and return capital to our shareholders. The challenges around us will remain, and I do not want anyone to underestimate the scale of the volatility and uncertainty in the market.\nHowever, as Tesco demonstrated throughout the pandemic, we have developed a level of responsiveness and resilience that sets us apart from many of our peers and gives me confidence that we can continue to create value for all of our stakeholders.\nThe last 6 months have been very challenging. And so I'm particularly pleased that we have continued to make great progress. We know that customers are facing unprecedented pressures in the cost of living, and it has, therefore, been critical that we've continued to support them with our relentless focus on value. Our investments in Aldi Price Match, Low Everyday Prices and Clubcard prices means that we are now as competitive as we have ever been.\nWe have continued to reward loyalty, too, with Clubcard growing both active users and sales penetration in every one of our markets. Customers are recognizing the value that Clubcard brings, and we are increasingly tailoring it to their specific needs. The progress we have made would not be possible without the hard work and resilience of the entire Tesco team. I want to say a huge thank you to all of our colleagues and our supplier partners for everything they're doing.\nI'm particularly pleased to announce this morning that we have made another investment in pay for our U.K. store colleagues in addition to the significant investment we announced in April. Our colleagues are really important stakeholders in our business and are critical in helping us create value for every other stakeholder. And we will continue to do everything we can to support them.\nI believe the external challenges facing the industry are well understood, and I'm not planning to spend a huge amount of time reiterating them here. But it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the extreme pressure many of our customers are under.\nIn June, we said that we were starting to see some small changes in customer behavior, but that it was difficult to separate them from the effects of post-pandemic normalization. We can now see tangible changes in behavior purely relating to increases in the cost of living. Whether it's switching to Tesco own brand to take advantage of our great prices or making more subtle changes, such as switching from fresh to frozen, we can see customers prioritizing value wherever they can.\nThis can create challenges for us in terms of our mix, even before we overlay the impact of significant commodity and cost inflation. However, with our capability, reach and scale, I see it as our role to protect customers from as much inflation as possible. We will continue to inflate a little bit less and a little bit later than the rest of the market and take it on ourselves to navigate the other challenges we face as a business to the best of our ability.\nRegardless of the environment we find ourselves in, we focus on creating value through a combination of customer satisfaction, market share and strong cash generation. As I said in April, customer satisfaction is critical to our success. It is the best measure of whether the efforts we are taking are being recognized by customers and underpins our ability to grow over the medium term. I'm therefore really pleased that our ongoing customer focus continues to be recognized.\nAcross the market, the pressures I have just outlined have led to a reduction in many of the usual customer metrics. However, against this backdrop, Tesco continues to be recommended by customers ahead of all the full line grocers.\nOur relative performance in our brand Net Promoter Score has also continued to increase, and we are now ranked #1 of the full-line grocers on this measure. And as you can see, our relative performance gap has continued to widen. Our goal is to protect and ideally grow our core U.K. market share over the medium and long term. I'm pleased with our performance in the half, which builds on 23 periods of switching gains in the prior 2 years. Versus this time last year, there is a small decline as we lap our period of greatest outperformance. But as you can see, when you look at it on a 2- or a 3-year view, we are the only one of the full-line grocers to gain share.\nThere is, of course, another dynamic in the market, with the limited range discounters gaining share as a result of them adding millions of square feet of new space over this period. The fact that Tesco have gained despite this impact demonstrates the strength of our business. And clearly, in like-for-like terms, we have significantly outperformed. Our capital discipline remains strong, and we will only invest where we see an attractive return.\nCash is one of the standouts for me in this half, and we are once again in a really strong position, having generated GBP 1.3 billion. Imran will share more details shortly. But for me, it demonstrates the inherent strength of our business and enables us to fulfill the commitments we have made as part of our capital allocation framework.\nDividends are an important part of that, and we have declared an interim dividend of 3.85p in line with our policy. We have also returned GBP 450 million to shareholders through our ongoing buyback program in the first half, bringing the total to GBP 750 million since we started in October 2021.\nIt is inevitable and appropriate that I focus a lot on the U.K. in these updates, but we have also continued to make great progress across the wider group. Booker has had an outstanding performance, growing in both retail and catering. It has benefited from being in tune with its customers' needs as they emerge from the pandemic and has continued to innovate its offer, such as through the formation of its food club, which now has over 40,000 independent restaurant members.\nIreland has also had a good half. Holding on to its strong market share, we have just started to convert the first stores we acquired from Joyce's. And if early signs or anything to go by, we are on to a resounding success.\nFinally, Central Europe has continued to do a great job, championing value in a highly inflationary environment. We have seen a great response to Clubcard prices, supporting an increase in Clubcard penetration to over 70%.\nI mentioned before the extreme pressures that many of our customers are under. As you can see here, across every part of the group, we are working relentlessly to do what we can to help. We have rolled out the same core elements of our value proposition in the U.K. to our businesses in Ireland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Tesco Mobile and the Bank, too, we have stepped forward with new propositions to help customers save money across even more of their household expenses.\nThe way that all our teams have worked together to bring Clubcard prices to every part of our offer is a great example of how we can leverage the skill and scale of the group. Our unrivaled reach puts us in a unique position to make more products more affordable in more places than anyone else. It is this laser focus on value that has supported the strong performance in the first half that Imran will now take you through.\nImran, over to you.\n\nImran Nawaz\n\nCFO & Director, Tate & Lyle Plc\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with an overview of performance, followed by some further details on key trends and drivers. Throughout the review, percentage growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless stated otherwise.\nGroup sales grew by 3.5%, a strong performance, building on the momentum over the last few years. Group profit decreased by 9.8% to GBP 1.3 billion. This reflects the impact of post-pandemic normalization and significant cost inflation, partially offset by very strong progress on Save to Invest.\nAlthough not shown here, statutory group operating profit was down 43.6% year-on-year. That is due to a GBP 626 million noncurrent asset impairment charge, driven by higher discount rates. This noncash movement does not reflect any change in the underlying strength of the business.\nI'm particularly pleased with our very strong retail cash flow performance of GBP 1.3 billion. The year-on-year movement reflects the impact of last year's exceptionally strong performance in both profit and working capital.\nNet debt at the end of the half was GBP 10 billion, a reduction of GBP 0.5 billion since the year-end. This is primarily driven by the very strong cash generation and is after the outflow of GBP 450 million relating to our share buyback. We generated headline earnings per share of 10.67p. The year-on-year change reflects our reduced operating profit, partially offset by a lower tax charge, lower net financing costs and the benefit of our ongoing share buyback program.\nIn line with our policy, we have proposed an interim dividend of 3.85p per ordinary share. As a reminder, our interim dividends are set at 35% of the prior year's full year dividend.\nTotal retail sales for the half were GBP 27.6 billion. Our U.K. and Ireland segment delivered a 2.6% increase in sales, driven by further strong performance in Booker. Our Central Europe segment delivered both strong sales and profit growth, driven by resilient volumes in an inflationary environment.\nWe saw year-on-year sales growth in Tesco Bank as revenues recovered strongly due to higher retail spending, demand for Travel Money and the annualized benefit of the acquisition of Tesco Underwriting in May last year. The bank generated GBP 67 million of profit in the first half, which I will come back to later.\nOver the next few slides, I will cover the performance of each of our segments in more detail, starting with sales before moving on to profit. Let's start with the U.K. We've seen very different drivers of performance across the half. So I'll briefly break it down by channel and then by category.\nIn our large stores, our sales grew by 1.4% over the half. The first quarter reflects the lapping of very strong nonfood demand in the prior year. Sales were much stronger in the second quarter, partially driven by warmer weather, the Platinum Jubilee celebrations and higher rates of inflation.\nAs anticipated, we saw a decline in online sales as we lapped peak demand during last year's lockdown in the first quarter. Our online business remains significantly larger than before the pandemic, and I'm really pleased that we've retained nearly 70% of the customers that we gained over the last 2 years. You'll see that we delivered a strong performance in our convenience stores throughout the half, driven by a sharp recovery in footfall in towns and cities as customers return to their workplaces. Sales in our city center stores grew by 26%.\nTurning to performance by category. Our Food business delivered sales that were up 1.6% over the half, which is after the impact of normalizing from the very high demand in the first quarter last year. We saw strong growth across the second quarter as we traded over a more normal period with some benefit from the exceptionally warm weather. We saw an increase in inflation across the market in the half and started to see the impact of changing customer behavior such as switching from branded to own brand products and substituting to better value alternatives.\nWe saw a significant decline in nonfood sales in quarter 1. That reflects a very strong performance last year when nonessential retailers were closed. Our year-on-year performance improved significantly in the second quarter, and we outperformed the market although we started to see a softening in demand in the more discretionary areas. I should remind you that our overall nonfood participation is relatively small, representing around 8% of sales for the group.\nOur strong performance in Ireland is somewhat masked by the impact of lapping elevated sales throughout the pandemic, particularly in the first quarter. We saw like-for-like sales growth strengthened to 2.4% in the second quarter as the impact eased. Clothing sales were particularly strong as we lapped restrictions last year that prevented us from selling certain products.\nOur convenience stores have performed strongly, and we continue to see strong growth in our online business as we expand our geographic coverage. We opened 5 new click and collect locations in the half with the service now available in over 70% of our large stores. Online now represents 9% of our sales in Ireland.\nWe completed our acquisition of 10 Joyce's Supermarkets in June this year. In Booker, sales grew across both the retail and catering businesses, building on the strong momentum from last year. The retail business delivered overall growth of 2.2%. Excluding tobacco, sales were up 6.7%, driven by strong customer retention in addition to general inflation across the market. Tobacco sales were down 3.7% as demand fell across the market, driven by higher duty-free imports as customers resumed traveling abroad post the pandemic.\nIn catering, we saw further strong sales growth driven by a sharp recovery as we traded over last year's restrictions when much of the hospitality sector was closed in the first quarter. We continued our strong momentum into the second quarter with sustained volume growth. Our catering performance includes strong growth in Best Foods Logistics, which had sales growth of 34.6% in the first half.\nMoving now to Central Europe. Like-for-like sales were up 10.4%, with growth across all 3 countries. Inflation has been more significant in our Central European markets due to macroeconomic factors, including retail tax changes. Volumes have remained resilient, partially due to government support for customers such as price caps on essential food products.\nMarket share improved across the half on a year-on-year basis, driven by switching gains. Customers have responded really well to the full rollout of Clubcard prices and our low price guarantee, which further strengthens our value proposition. We saw a strong performance in general merchandise as we were able to offer our full range following nonfood sales restrictions last year.\nLet's now move on to profit. As you can see, retail operating profit decreased by GBP 138 million year-on-year, which reflects the net reduction in the U.K. and ROI segment, partially offset by profit growth in Central Europe. I'll break the movement down in more detail on the next few slides.\nIn the U.K. and ROI, the profit decline of 11.5% was driven by a number of factors, most notably the year-on-year normalization in volumes post the pandemic. Mix was a little bit negative year-on-year due to the effect of customers switching to own brand products to offset cost of living pressures. Significant operating cost inflation, including our largest ever single year investment in colleague pay and higher energy costs, were partially mitigated by our accelerated Save to Invest program.\nTurning to Central Europe. Profit was up 19.1%, which reflects the resilient volume performance in the region and well-managed inflation in both input and operating costs. Food sales grew strongly, and we saw a strong performance in convenience as customers return to city center stores. The strong profit performance is after an additional GBP 14 million charge due to an increase in the Hungarian retail sales tax.\nIn Tesco Bank, we have seen revenue growth driven by an increase in new credit card customers and recovery in our Travel Money service and higher levels of retail spending. The bank's profit declined year-on-year, predominantly driven by a higher impairment charge due to upfront charges on new business and worsening macroeconomic indicators. This was partially offset by the profitable growth in Travel Money and the ATM business.\nThis year's operating profit includes an GBP 18 million contribution from Tesco Underwriting being fully consolidated following the completion of the acquisition in May last year. The bank's balance sheet remains strong.\nThis slide gives you more detail on the components of our statutory profit performance, which decreased by 68.1%, primarily as a result of the noncash impairment of noncurrent assets that I mentioned previously.\nNet finance costs before fair value remeasurements were GBP 88 million lower than last year. This was driven by net pension finance income this year as a result of our overall group pension surplus compared to a charge last year. Net finance costs include a fair value remeasurement charge of GBP 75 million, primarily relating to the mark-to-market movement on inflation-linked swaps, which was a significant change to the prior year due to an increase in discount rates. Our tax charge was GBP 148 million, down from GBP 313 million in the prior year. This reflects lower operating profit and a one-off charge in the prior year that related to a revaluation of our deferred tax liability.\nMoving now to cash. We've generated GBP 1.3 billion of retail free cash on top of an exceptionally strong performance last year. Retail cash from operations was strong at GBP 2 billion. Our total working capital inflow was also strong at GBP 390 million, driven mainly by higher trade balances due to cost price inflation and higher sales at the end of the half. Both of these amounts were lower year-on-year due to a reduction in food volumes and the effects of the sharp recovery in fuel volumes last year.\nCapital expenditure in the half was GBP 507 million, and we have provided the usual breakdown both by region and type in the appendices. Our CapEx remains on track to be in line with full year guidance. We paid GBP 294 million of interest costs, of which GBP 188 million related to finance charges on lease liabilities and GBP 106 million to interest paid on bank debt. Interest costs reduced year-on-year as a result of property buybacks lowering our lease liabilities.\nOur cash tax paid was GBP 45 million, which is broadly in line with last year. This is after the continued benefit from the one-off pension contribution in 2021 following the disposal of our Asia business. It also reflects the super deduction allowance on certain capital investments, which was introduced in March 2021. Finally, there was a 51 million movement in relation to the purchase of shares to satisfy share schemes.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of the half was GBP 10 billion, GBP 0.5 billion lower than the year-end, primarily driven by a reduction in underlying net debt before lease liabilities due to our strong cash generation. This position at the end of the half is net of the GBP 450 million worth of shares that we have bought back through the first half.\nLease liabilities increased marginally to GBP 8 billion, largely due to the recognition of new leases related to the leaseback of the 17 stores that we sold in Central Europe that I mentioned earlier.\nThe IAS 19 pension deficit was broadly in line with the year-end. As a reminder, only pension schemes, which are in a net deficit position, are included in our total indebtedness.\nAt a total level, we continue to carry a post-tax pension surplus of GBP 1.1 billion. I'm really pleased to confirm that we have agreed the actuarial pension valuation as at 31st of March 2022, with the trustees at a surplus of GBP 0.9 billion. We have also been able to agree with the trustees that we don't need to make any pension deficit contributions ahead of the next triennial valuation in 2025. Furthermore, the expense payments to this scheme by Tesco will reduce by GBP 8 million per year to GBP 17 million. Our net debt ratio was 2.5x within our published guidance range and stable since year-end. And our fixed charge cover was 3.5x, also in line with the prior year-end.\nBefore I finish, I wanted to talk briefly about the updated guidance that we've published today. As you will have seen in the statement, despite ongoing challenges in the market, I'm pleased that we are able to maintain our profit guidance within our previous range, albeit towards the lower end. We, therefore, expect full year retail adjusted operating profits of between GBP 2.4 billion and GBP 2.5 billion. Significant uncertainties in the external environment do still exist, most notably how consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strong and ongoing focus on cash and a more positive expectation on working capital means that we have upgraded our expectation for full year retail free cash flow to be at least GBP 1.8 billion. We continue to expect bank adjusted operating profits of around GBP 120 million to GBP 160 million.\nTo summarize, as you have seen today, we have reported a solid performance despite the tough backdrop. We have confidence in our capital allocation and multiyear performance frameworks continuing to guide our actions so that we can create sustainable long-term value for every Tesco stakeholder.\nIn line with our dividend policy of 35% of prior year earnings, I'm pleased that we have been able to announce an interim dividend of 3.85p. As part of our ongoing capital return program, we repurchased GBP 450 million worth of Tesco shares in the first half, which takes us to a total of GBP 750 million since we started the program last year. We are on track to buy back a total of GBP 1.05 billion by April 2023.\nThank you very much for your time, and I now hand back to Ken.\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director, Tesco PLC\n\nThank you, Imran. Now to our strategic priorities. As a reminder, there are 4 priorities that help us stay competitive, accelerate our growth and ensure that we can sustainably generate strong levels of retail free cash flow. I hope you are starting to get familiar with them. But as a reminder, they are Magnetic Value for Customers, I love my Tesco Clubcard, Easily the Most Convenient and Save to Invest.\nI'm going to give you a relatively brief update on each of the drivers this morning. Magnetic value and Save to Invest have been particularly critical given the inflationary environment, but all 4 have kept us moving forward with our long-term plans. Great prices are an essential component of Magnetic Value. And as I've just said, they are particularly important in the current environment. Clearly, the entire market has had to cope with significant inflationary pressures. And inevitably, this has led to price increases for customers.\nAt Tesco, we have continued to do everything we can to hold back inflation wherever possible. Where it has been passed on, we are ensuring that it is a little bit less and a little bit later than the rest of the market. You can see that this has allowed us to maintain a strong price position, with our price index showing that we have consistently been cheaper than the market for the last 56 weeks. Importantly, we're also at the most competitive we have ever been versus the limited range discounters. Customers are recognizing our ongoing commitment to value, with our perception score relative to the market continuing to strengthen.\nAldi Price Match has been the cornerstone of our value proposition, helping to remove price as a reason for customers to shop elsewhere. It remains a key component alongside Low Everyday Prices and Clubcard prices. As customers have sought out the great value that it offers, we have made it even easier to access by increasing the distribution with a wider range of products in more stores across the estate.\nAs a result, in addition to featuring in virtually all large baskets, Aldi Price Match now features in over 80% of our top-up shops. Clubcard prices have now been rolled out across the entire group and offer customers great deals on a wide range of products, ensuring they can save across food, clothing, Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile.\nFinally, Low Everyday Prices. You will have seen today that we have launched a significant new price lock commitment, freezing low prices on over 1,000 products until 2023. Our Low Everyday Prices campaign covers products and brands that customers buy in week in, week out. It covers everything from cupboard staples and teatime favorites through to household and health and beauty products. As we head into the winter months and great value becomes even more important for our customers, we hope that this new price lock commitment will provide even more confidence that there is no need for them to shop elsewhere.\nWhen customers' budgets are under pressure, they need to have confidence that the food that they are buying is of great quality. Along with our progress on value, our quality perception has gone from strength to strength, increasing 208 basis points year-on-year and ahead of the market. We have strengthened our premium offering, with our finest range increasing by more than 13% year-on-year. Our finest performance has remained strong and continues to be a focus for us as customers look to do more of their entertaining and socializing at home.\nFinest is just one element of the improvements we've made to our dining-in offer, and we're pleased to increase our market share in the important Dinner For Tonight segment by 83 basis points year-on-year.\nThe 2 other components of Magnetic Value are health and sustainability. Earlier in the half, we launched our Better Baskets campaign, making it easier for customers to make healthier and more sustainable choices without compromising on price every time they shop with us.\nOn climate change, we have been continuing to develop the strategy behind our ambitious value chain targets and making further progress in electrifying our transport. We have introduced HGV trailers with refrigeration units powered by solar panels, each saving around 2,000 liters of diesel per year. We also became the first retailer to launch a zero-emission electric lorry, servicing over 400 stores in Greater London. Each lorry is expected to replace around 30,000 diesel-fueled road miles every year.\nWe continue to work closely with our suppliers, with a particular focus on British agriculture. We are helping support British farmers with the many challenges they are facing. For example, giving extra funding to pig farmers and increasing the price we pay dairy farmers for fresh milk. We are also working hard to reduce food and packaging waste. We accelerated our target to have food waste by 5 years, bringing it forward to 2025. On plastic, we have now removed multipack wrap from all of our own brand canned fizzy drinks, saving 12 million pieces of plastic a year.\nMoving now to the second of our strategic priorities, I Love My Tesco Clubcard. We've made great progress throughout the half on Clubcard, with Clubcard prices fully rolled out across all markets and businesses and Clubcard satisfaction up 5 points year-on-year. Clubcard penetration has also increased significantly and is proving an invaluable tool for customers as they navigate the pressures they are facing. Clubcards are now used on 75% of sales across all stores in the U.K. The number of active Clubcard households is now at over 20 million, an increase of just over 3 million versus last year.\nAlongside this, our Clubcard app is gaining even greater traction. Now with 10 million users in the U.K., 1 million in Central Europe and over 300,000 in Ireland. And we're rewarding customers even further. We have launched in-app personalization to 2 million Clubcard holders giving them coupons tailored to the areas that matter most to them.\nI wanted to take a few moments to remind you how the progress we are making in Clubcard fits in our wider digital platform strategy. The points I've just outlined are all about putting the foundations in place, creating a strong proposition through Clubcard prices and enabled us to significantly increase penetration, at the same time, as migrating customers onto our digital offering. We've also been developing our capability in parallel. This includes enhancing our ability to personalize, strengthening our digital customer experience and reinvigorating our data science business, dunnhumby.\nAlthough it is early days, we have already started to benefit from the application of this capability. As I've already mentioned, we have applied many of the initiatives that we have launched in the U.K. across the group. We are building the strong base dunnhumby as already established with suppliers through dunnhumby shop. And we have launched a new service, Tesco Media & Insights, which is starting to work with a range of consumer goods brands to monetize some of the new opportunities we have created. While the bringing together of these tools and capabilities is still relatively new, I see it as one of the most important long-term opportunities for us to focus on.\nOur third priority is Easily the Most Convenient, serving our customers wherever, whenever and however they want. It's about keeping our existing estate relevant for customers while seeking out capital-light growth in convenience and online. I mentioned back in April that we were expecting further normalization in the online market in the current year, and this is what we have seen. Orders while still strong at over 1.1 million per week are down around 10% year-on-year. Happily, where we are seeing customers return to shopping in store, a large proportion of these are doing so with us.\nOur online business still remains significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels, and we've seen a robust performance in market share, holding broadly flat year-on-year. Our online proposition is supported by the combination of urban fulfillment centers; click and collect sites; and Whoosh, our superfast home delivery service. We opened our fifth urban fulfillment center in Rutherglen in May and plan to open 2 more later this year. As we continue to test and learn, we've made improvements to our processes, software and hardware, leading to a much faster ramp up to capacity in Rutherglen compared with our earlier urban fulfillment centers.\nWe have continued our rollout of click and collect locations with circa 70% of all U.K. households now within a 25-minute drive of a site. We've worked hard to improve the customer experience, launching curbside pickup in 180 locations. We have more than doubled the number of stores where Tesco Whoosh is available to 442, and expect to reach a total of more than 800 by the end of the financial year.\nOur convenience business has continued to perform strongly coming out of the pandemic. We have continued with our opening program in the U.K. with 17 new Express stores in the last 6 months and more planned for the remainder of the year. We have also opened a small number of stores in Ireland and Central Europe. We're continuing to expand the Booker network with a net increase of 195 new retail openings as well as increasing the number of catering customers.\nOur final strategic priority is Save to Invest. Last year, we set ourselves the goal of being able to save around GBP 1 billion of cost over 3 years to help offset the impact of cost inflation on our business each year. We've made really good progress. To give some examples, we have simplified our stock and replenishment routines in store, ensuring that colleagues time is used as efficiently as possible. Our reduced stock control routines have saved nearly 47,000 hours a week as a result. We also move more replenishment from nights to days, enabling more colleagues to be available on the shop floor to help customers at peak times. We have reviewed many of our supplier contracts for goods and services not for resale, retendering some to achieve better prices and consolidating others to reduce levels of duplication.\nWe said in April that given the significant cost pressures we are facing, we would look to accelerate the program. I'm pleased to say that we are well ahead of our original 3-year plan and on track to deliver savings of around GBP 500 million this year. Based on our progress so far and the momentum we've established, we are now seeking to deliver the original target of around GBP 1 billion of savings by the end of February 2024, a year earlier than initially planned.\nIn summary, we are pleased to have delivered a strong performance in a challenging market and to have done so at the same time as investing for our customers and colleagues at a time when they need us most. Our strategic priorities are serving us well. They will continue to guide our progress for the long term as we double down and relentlessly focus on value, competitiveness and operational execution.\nI am pleased that we are on track to deliver the profit we have outlined in our guidance this morning. It is a challenging environment and we all face significant uncertainties in the months ahead, but we are confident in our ability to continue generating strong cash flows and creating value for shareholders.\nThank you for your time so far. Imran and I are now really happy to take your questions.\n(Operator Instructions) So with that, I'll pass back to the operator, and we'll take your questions. Thank you."

Lawton\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Tractor Supply as we delivered record results on both sales and earnings. I would like to begin by thanking the 48,000-plus Tractor Supply team members for once again delivering impressive performance through strong execution and for their dedication to serving Life Out Here.\nOur business continues to be incredibly stable and resilient. This quarter, the team did an excellent job managing inflationary impacts operating through continued supply chain disruption and navigating the evolving consumer demand. We continue to win with our customers and took substantial share in the quarter. We enter the back half of the year with our inventory on plan and excellent visibility into our expense base. We remain very confident in our growth outlook and our Life Out Here strategy. Structural tailwinds continue to benefit us, including rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership. Our brand, loyalty program, digital capabilities, supply chain and 2,000-plus stores create significant enduring advantages for us. And our strategic initiatives are all on track and reaching scale.\nNow let's turn to a review of the business for the second quarter of 2022. In many ways, the second quarter was a mirror image of Q1. The quarter started off slow as April was pressured from cycling stimulus and the delayed start of spring. May was our strongest month. June was solid and modestly above the quarter's comp in spite of record-breaking heat, which has continued into Q3 and will limit the sales upside in the current quarter.\nWe grew net sales by 8.4% with comparable store sales up 5.5%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7.5%, offset by a decline in transactions of 2%. We experienced positive comp sales growth for each of the last 9 weeks of the quarter. Comp transactions were positive for the months of May and June combined. Diluted EPS was $3.53, an increase of 10.7%. Year-round categories were up high single digits, indicative of our demand-driven, needs-based business model.\nThe impressive results in our consumable, usable and edible categories continued this quarter as the business performed more than 3x our overall sales growth rate. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of CUE outperforming our overall results.\nOur seasonal performance was below the company average, but positive. Big ticket was flat to last year and exceeded our expectations given that we were cycling strong performance last year driven by stimulus and ideal weather for the spring and summer season. We had strength in zero-term mowers, chicken coops, battery-operated outdoor power equipment and grills, with the biggest declines coming from frontage and mowers, log splitters and walk-behind mowers.\nOur Neighbor's Club reached a record 26 million members in the quarter. Our Neighbor's Club members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance. We are seeing strong growth in industry-leading retention in our high-value customers.\nOur team members' commitment to providing legendary service continues to differentiate the shopping experience within our stores. As a proof point, our customers' overall satisfaction scores were at the highest level ever for a second quarter. We are successfully scaling our store real estate and remodel projects. To date, we have over 400 stores in the Project Fusion format. We have over 230 stores with garden centers, more than 100 stores with store than the store Carhartts and over 600 stores with a pet wash. These are all improvements that make Tractor Supply a more contemporary, relevant farm and ranch-oriented retailer. These improvements are allowing us to gain share with new and existing customers. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Although the operating environment may be different than we anticipated as we entered the year, we're pleased with how we're navigating the various circumstances and remain very confident in the significant opportunities ahead of us.\nTrack Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through varying economic conditions. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it. Our customers overindexes homeowners, landowners, animal owners and pet owners. We believe that the structural macro trends that I mentioned earlier are long term and sustainable. As the market leader, we have substantial advantages.\nAdditionally, our investments in our Life Out Here strategy are reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Tractor Supply has never been stronger. Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to welcome Kimberley Gardiner as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Kimberley succeeds Christi Korzekwa, who announced her retirement earlier this year. Kimberley brings an extensive background in marketing with a data-driven approach to brand development that I believe will continue the evolution of our marketing organization and continue to build on the strength of the Tractor Supply brand. Our appreciation and thanks go to Christi for her leadership and dedication over the last decade at Tractor Supply.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the second quarter and our financial outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. At the halfway mark for the year, the Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. We are very pleased with the consistency and the strength of our top line performance. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain.\nWe continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting our vendor partners. Comp transactions declined 2.0%, which was slightly below our expectations. As we anticipated pressure from cycling the benefits of stimulus in the prior year, we experienced incremental headwinds from the delayed start to the spring and the drought conditions in the latter part of the quarter.\nComplementing the commentary Hal shared on the cadence of the quarter, all regions of the country delivered positive sales comps, the geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. We did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the drought. In particular, the far West (inaudible) regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. The South Central and South Atlantic were our best-performing regions.\nTurning to our digital performance. The second quarter represented our largest e-commerce quarter in net sales ever. On the back of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, our e-commerce grew approximately 7%. Excluding April, we had solid performance with double-digit sales for May and June combined. Our mobile app continues to ramp with double-digit growth and represented about 15% of total digital sales in the quarter.\nPetsense continues to perform well with comp sales growth above the company average.\nTurning now to gross margin. For the second quarter, our gross margin declined by 24 basis points to 35.5% of sales. This was primarily attributable to 3 factors: significant product cost inflation, higher transportation costs and, to a lesser extent, product mix given the robust growth in CUE products. We continue to experience broad-based inflation. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. As we shared last quarter, we expect many of these inflationary trends to continue into the second half of 2022.\nI continue to give the team a lot of credit for the remarkable job they are doing. Between tracking and forecasting freight and the coordination of retail price increases at the store level, they have been nimble. The team has effectively managed these cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club.\nSG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales, was 22.1%, an improvement of 19 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to more normalized incentive compensation and the moderation of COVID-19 response costs as well as leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and our strategic growth initiatives, which includes a step-up in our depreciation and amortization.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2021, operating profit margin was essentially flat, contracting by only 4 basis points. Net income improved 7.1% to $397 million and diluted EPS increased 10.7% to $3.53. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned $291 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and higher cash dividends. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through the first 6 months of the year to $691 million.\nTurning to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. Consistent with the first quarter, this increase is primarily attributable to inflation. We believe the quality and the composition of our inventory is excellent and that we are in great shape as we go into the second half of the year. If anything, we are pursuing more inventory as there are categories we are working to improve our in-stock position.\nTo provide more clarity on this, on a 3-year basis, our units per store inventory has increased single digits while sales are up over 60%.\nMoving now to our updated guidance for 2022, which is detailed in our press release we issued this morning. We are raising our financial outlook for the year given our strong performance year-to-date, as Hal mentioned earlier. This now includes net sales in the range of $13.95 billion to $14.05 billion with comparable store sales growth of 5.2% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating profit margin around 10.2%. This represents the midpoint of our previous guidance of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales.\nWhile higher costs have handicapped some upside, at the same time, we believe we are able to mitigate pressures on the downside. Diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $9.48 to $9.60 compared to our prior guidance of $9.20 to $9.50. Please note that our fiscal 2022 guidance includes a benefit for the 53rd week, which is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percentage points of net sales and $0.15 of diluted EPS.\nAs you model the second half of the year, let me address 2 items. First, for both the third and fourth quarters, we would anticipate that our comp sales growth would be consistent with our first half of the year. As Hal mentioned earlier, the extreme heat and drought conditions are continuing into the third quarter, and we forecast these conditions will limit upside to sales.\nSecond, I want to address the cadence of operating profit. We anticipate the earnings cadence between Q3 and Q4 to be more in line with historical trends. For operating profit margin in the second half of the year, we forecast flat to slight contraction. The performance in the fourth quarter is forecast to be positive year-over-year, with the third quarter experiencing some contraction. The variation between the quarters is predominantly a function of gross margin. Specifically, the third quarter will experience greater mix pressures from the strength we're seeing in CUE and higher transportation costs. Both of these factors we first experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, so our compares naturally ease in the fourth quarter.\nFor the second half of the year, we expect inflation to be consistent at an elevated level. With as much inflation pressure we are seeing in our business, we continue to closely watch comparable average ticket and transactions. In times of rising inflation, we anticipate that the breakdown of comp sales growth will trend to higher ticket performance from inflation, offset by transactions. The impact on transactions is pronounced this year, especially as we lap the prior year's benefit from stimulus.\nAs a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home is not included in our guidance. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update soon. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and our outlook for 2022. The resiliency of our business has been proven over time. We have an amazing track record of navigating the challenges of the external environment. As evidenced by our ongoing market share gains, the team is executing at a very high level. Our financial outlook for the year is delivering on the key drivers of our long-term algorithm that we shared in January, accelerated sales growth, strong earning and increased cash return to our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThanks, Kurt. Okay. So now let's review some of the growth drivers for Tractor Supply to capture the significant opportunity we see ahead of us. As previously mentioned, with a total addressable market of $180 billion, our Life Out Here Strategy positions us well to capture the market share.\nFirst, Project Fusion and Garden Center initiatives are 2 key growth drivers of our strategy, and they're designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. We are on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year-end. Our multiyear plan to renovate existing stores allows us to improve the shopping experience for our customers with a revitalized layout and expanded offerings. The changes are resonating with our customers and our team members.\nAs of today, we have over 230 garden centers that are up and running. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the year-end. Over the spring and summer selling seasons, our stores with a garden center significantly outperformed the chain average and are on track with our business case. The expanded assortment of live goods is resonating not only with existing customers, but is a key asset to attracting new customers that's CUE female and younger. The garden centers have allowed us to gain share and will continue to play a significant role in our merchandising plans across the seasons.\nAs the #1 seller of [dog] feed and a top 5 retailer in pet food, it is critical that we are able to deliver for our customers as the dependable supplier in these CUE categories. These are destination categories for us that drive trips. Our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on CUE as we work to ensure we not only have capacity for future growth that maintain the lowest cost to serve. To support our store growth and increased demand, our ninth distribution center located in Navarre, Ohio is on track to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2023.\nAdditionally, we are targeting the top 180 most challenged stores to implement a full suite of resources, which would include things like a feed room, mixing center allocations, high-volume store racking and much more. To date, our process improvements have been executed across about 50% of our targeted stores. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the improved operations at these stores.\nWith the success of our Fusion and Garden Center projects, growth in our Neighbor's Club, the increased volume, velocity and variety of CUE products moving through our supply chain in stores allows us to leverage our scale and sophistication to widen our position in farm and ranch. Mobile engagement is a moat that we are creating around our business. We are well on our way to converting our 26 million Neighbor's Club members into power users of our app. We are currently ahead of our year-to-date goals for our mobile app downloads. With new offers and features like the My Pet mobile app personalization, we are able to differentiate our digital shopping experience and capture growth opportunities.\nWhether online or in stores, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the change from summer to fall with our customers. Innovation and newness resonate with our customers and our merchant team have exciting plans to capitalize on our customer needs. Our customers count on us for brands that have the durability to get the job done and clothing is no exception. For instance, our lineup of apparel, workwear and accessories includes leading brands like Carhartt, Wrangler and Columbia as well as our exclusive brand, Ridgecut.\nRidgecut has resonated with our customers and has allowed for our assortment expansion to include footwear and women's clothing. From insulated outerwear, hoodies, long-sleeved T-shirts, boots and more, our apparel products focus on the demand-driven workwear categories.\nIn truck tool and hardware, our annual event ultimate workshop, will be in stores in the coming weeks and will be bigger than ever. More than 700 stores now have an improved tool coral. Our lineup of relevant brands like Porter-Cable exclusively at Tractor Supply, the expansion of Makita and strong brands like Bosch and DeWalt makes our ultimate workshop sales event more relevant.\nThe event offers great value on the brands our customers need to outfit their workshop or garage. We also have a new strategic partnership with Interstate Battery that we will roll out in the fourth quarter. Interstate Battery has a proven track record and is the largest battery distribution network in the United States that will allow us to better serve our stores. Branded as traveler by Interstate Battery, we will have a great lineup that is relevant all with improved in-stocks and reliability.\nIn our seasonal business, we anticipate that this will be a strong heating season given the elevated energy costs. As the dependable supplier in this destination category, we are investing to ensure we have strong in-stock position. In heating, we have a new collection of innovative and exclusive home heating equipment with smart home technology providing maximum efficiency and a cost-effective way for our customers to heat their homes. For the fall harvest and Christmas holiday season, we will be leveraging an expanded assortment of our garden centers to drive productivity of the space.\nAnd importantly, across our CUE categories, we are committed to being in stock and priced right for our customers. Our CUE categories continue to drive trips to Tractor Supply. As an example, our pet customer counts are up high single digits with trips and baskets increasing for these customers. This is a trend we're seeing across other CUE categories like livestock feed and poultry.\nWe are well positioned to continue to gain market share with a great lineup of seasonally relevant products with legendary customer service. To wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making significant progress laying the foundation for the future. Track Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many different business cycles. Our business has been incredibly resilient and stable over the last several years, whether we look at that by week, region or product category. At the same time, we believe we have visibility into our cost and are managing our inventory to customer demand. We are winning with our customers. With significant growth and market share opportunities, it remains an exciting time at Tractor Supply.\nMy thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For today's call, I will go through some highlights of our first quarter. Seth will then share some merchandising initiatives and updates and Kurt will review the quarter and our outlook in greater detail. Before we get started, I'd like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. No matter the operating environment or how the seasons of the year unfold, this is a team that is always there for our customers and our communities to be the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. For nearly 85 years, our business has proven to be resilient stable and very consistent as we provide needs-based, demand-driven product categories as a lifestyle retailer.\nNow let's turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2023. We grew net sales by nearly double digits at 9.1%, with comparable stores up 2.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.65. We had 7 points of non-comp sales growth in the quarter. The 2 primary drivers were new stores and the Orscheln acquisition. We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and the Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. And the Orscheln integration is running ahead of schedule.\nOur comp sales results were below our expectations. We attribute just over 200 basis points, the majority of our sales [ mix ] to a delayed start to the spring and to a lesser extent, a milder January. We continue to closely review customer data for trends and changes and their behavior. While select discretionary categories were below in the chain average, this was offset by stronger demand in our consumable, usable and edible products. We believe our customers remain resilient, but are being judicious with their spending as they seek us out as a destination for value and are buying closer to need. Excluding our seasonal categories, our sales were in line with our expectations, and our core business remained very strong.\nOur comparable store sales growth was driven by ticket growth of 2.8%, offset by a decline in transactions of 0.7%. Importantly, our comp transaction trends improved each month of the quarter and were positive in February and March, with strong performance in our year-round categories. The strength in our year-round categories was driven by CUE products, which exhibited ongoing impressive demand this quarter. These products are needs-based and demand-driven and are what drive trips and transactions to our stores.\nAcross companion animal and livestock, we had strong performance. The strength we've experienced over the last 3 years in our CUE customer trends remains robust as we continue to gain material market share. In companion animal, we continue to see substantial share gains throughout the category. And we're seeing sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week, each month, each quarter.\nIn livestock, our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for us, with the poultry category up strong double digits. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we're also seeing robust growth in new customers to the category, driving both trips and ticket.\nOne exciting aspect of the new customers to the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and use this as a resource for all things related to homesteading beyond poultry to categories like gardening.\nBig ticket declines were driven by seasonal trends and to a lesser degree, ongoing pullback in discretionary categories. The slow start to spring impacted outdoor power equipment, which weighed on our big ticket results and average ticket. The most significant pressure was in zero-turn tractors, generators and trailers. Our customers have a long history of buying these items based on need. Current trends support that we are seeing purchasing consistently closer to the season or moment of need.\nOverall, our big ticket trends were very similar to what has been reported in the recent March retail sales data. Our mobile app currently represents more than 20% of our digital sales. The app is now ranked in the top 100 shopping apps on the iOS store. This is a major recognition of the progress in our ONETractor strategy to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our customer scores continue to run at all-time highs.\nOverall, our customer experience metrics continue to keep momentum into 2023 with strong improvements over the last quarter and year-over-year. Our store teams are doing a tremendous job servicing our customers. Our Neighbor's Club just celebrated last week a significant milestone with over 30 million members. As our points-based program enters its third year, the strength in Neighbor's Club continues to exceed our expectations. Our members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance, and we continue to see strong growth and retention in our high-value customers.\nAs mentioned previously, the Orscheln Farm and Home integration is going very well. I had the opportunity recently to visit 1 of our first store conversions to the Tractor Supply brand. There is excitement across both our team members and, importantly, our customers as they recognize that we're committed to providing the region with an elevated product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer.\nDuring the quarter, we opened our ninth and largest distribution center in Nevarre, Ohio. The ramp of the distribution center is right on schedule. With the opening in the new DC, the integration of 81 Orscheln stores and addition of new TSC stores, we capitalized on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service those stores, and allow us to reduce our freight costs, which you'll hear more about from Kurt.\nAt Tractor Supply, our purpose as a company is to serve life out here. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to preserve and protect our way of life. 2 weeks ago, we issued our fourth annual Stewardship Tear Sheet, highlighting the actions and progress that we've made on our sustainability, DE&I and community commitments. I am proud of our progress towards our ambitious stewardship goals, but know there is more to be done as we work towards achieving our net-zero and other goals heading towards 2040.\nTo wrap up, while our first quarter sales were below our expectations, we have a lot of the year still ahead of us. The American consumer broadly remains challenged, but we believe that our customer remains resilient. Spring continues to be cooler and wetter as we've turned into Q2. That said, we're encouraged by quarter-to-date trends with comps mid-single digit and comp transactions positive. Based on our experience and the nature of our needs-based demand-driven business, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half as the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year.\nWhile we acknowledge that the softer sales in January will not be recouped, we are pleased with our lineup for spring and summer. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth and earnings growth as well. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2023.\nBefore I turn the call over to Seth, I'd like to share some background on Seth and the merchandising team at Tractor Supply. Seth is an 18-year veteran of Tractor Supply, having held roles across marketing, finance, e-commerce and merchandising. He has a passion for this lifestyle and has served as our Chief Merchant since 2020. Given our record sales growth over the last 3 years, we recently completed a realignment of our merchandising product categories and promoted 2 Vice Presidents to Senior Vice Presidents to better support the growing needs of our business. Seth will provide a review of our sales by category and our plans to continue to gain market share.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Seth to discuss some further insights.\n\nJonathan Seth Estep\n\nSVP of GMM, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThank you, Hal. I'm excited to share with you some insights into our merchandising categories and market share position. We are committed to driving sales productivity as we deepen our relationships with our customers. I'd like to start by congratulating Nicole Logan, SVP of Animal and Softline divisions; and Randall Dodds, SVP of Seasonal and Hardlines divisions on the recent promotions. They each bring significant retail and industry experience that complement their tenure at Tractor Supply. These new roles each have 3 merchandising divisions reporting to each of them. It is exciting to have this new organizational structure to allow us to operate at greater scale, have deeper category insights and enhanced strategic partnerships.\nOverall, we're now organized into 6 merchandising divisions. So let's start with our largest division, companion animal, that represents more than 20% of our 2022 sales. This business includes both the consumables and hardlines across companion animal. Around 75% of the Tractor Supply customers have a pet, and approximately 50% have more than 1 pet. Also, our customers dog weight on average about 20 pounds more than the U.S. average. With the ongoing humanization of companion animals, these key structural tailwinds support our positive outlook on this category. We are a destination for pet customers with a comprehensive and differentiated assortment at an everyday low price, and we continue to gain share.\nFor example, our growth in pet food, treats and litter continues to lead the market in both dollar and pound growth, gaining another 33 basis points of share in Q1. Our business model of private brands, strong national and differentiated partners, club pack sizes and legendary customer service sets us up to continue gaining share, perhaps even more if we see the consumer more pressured for value.\nMoving on to our second largest division, livestock and equine, which represents just under 20% of sales. This is a key category for farm and ranch, and we continue to consistently outperform the market. Of note, this category is almost solely the consumables portion of our lifestyle feed categories. In other words, this business does not include fencing, which, in many ways, can be considered containment for large animals. With strong exclusive brands like DuMOR and Producer's Pride, along with national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more, we continue to innovate across our key categories of poultry, equine and cattle. We are the clear leader in this space with approximately 20% market share. Broadly, 1 out of every 5 bags of animal feed is bought at Tractor Supply, and we continue to take share, consistently outperforming the market by 5 percentage points.\nNext up in our category lineup at an equal weighting are our seasonal and our truck tool and hardware divisions. We are excited to get our spring seasonal business off and running. This is an area where we think we have substantial share opportunities. We are a leader in core categories like outdoor power as the destination for zero-turn mowers and categories like grass feed and fertilizers. Also, our live goods assortment is included in this division.\nAs of today, we have more than 350 garden centers ready for spring, with the vast majority just entering year 2 of operations. Where spring weather has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers' response to the expanded product offering and layout in our Fusion and Garden Center stores. More broadly, this season, we are offering a differentiated garden assortment of live goods, including vegetables and plants, soils, mulch, and chemicals tailored to Life Out Here. We like our initial reads for seasonal products where the weather has turned and are excited for the spring season.\nOur fourth division is truck, tool and hardware that includes lifestyle items like trailers, power tools, routers and truck accessories. Historically, in tools, we have serviced as a convenience play in power tools and hardware. As part of our Fusion layout, we have made significant investments in corresponding progress on elevating our power tool selection, and it has resulted in 1 of the highest sales lift categories in our Fusion stores. The additions of Makita, Bosch and [ Renault ], coupled with being the exclusive retail destination for PORTER-CABLE power tools, has allowed us to have consistent share gains over the last 3 years.\nUp next is our Ag and Outdoor Recreation division, which includes categories such as fencing and sprayers as well as our Outdoor Sport categories. We are in the business of helping people maintain their land and contain their animals. We have the largest share in the country and have outgrown the market by mid-single digits. And for Outdoor Recreation, we are very excited about the growth prospects for this segment as we test an expanded assortment in several Orscheln Farm and Home stores.\nOur final segment ranked on sales volume is clothing and decor, which has exhibited rapid growth since the pandemic, trending well above the company average. This business includes apparel, footwear and farmhouse decor. As one of the largest retailers of Carhartt, along with other brands like Wrangler and Columbia, our customers are finding our assortment needs, their workwear needs and their lifestyle. For years, we've known there was a market opportunity in women's workwear at Tractor Supply. And the team has leaned into this category, and the shopper is responding. While still off a relatively small base, our women's apparel business grew 24% in Q1, led by growth in our exclusive brands of Blue Mountain and Ridgecut. We will continue to look for ways to grow these high-margin categories by growing both leading national and best-in-class exclusive brands.\nIn closing, with our new alignment and additional resources, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to be the market leader and operate with speed, agility and efficiency to capture growth and drive sales productivity. We are in the midst of 1 of the most exciting times at Tractor Supply as we are in the spring season. And I hope you get a chance to get out to our stores and see all the exciting merchandising experiences and product innovation.\nNow I'll turn it over to Kurt.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Co.\n\nThank you, Seth, and hello to everyone on the call. I will add on to Hal's comments about the quarter and our outlook for the year. Let's start with our first quarter results. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a soft January. Last year's January was strong, so we expect it to start soft, but we did not anticipate that the month would be the second warmest in 30-plus years. February was more normalized and in line with our expectations, but the mild winter continued to pressure results. To put it in perspective, our heating categories were down nearly 50%, insulated outerwear was down over 30% and emergency response categories were also down significantly. As a result, our winter seasonal products were down double digits for the quarter.\nOur expectation was that as we moved through the quarter, we would see a more normalized spring selling season unfold, where we saw the majority of the shortfall was really in the last 3 weeks of March, which were abnormally wet and much cooler than normal as well as winter weather continued in the Midwest and Northeast. To put it in historical context, March was the coldest in 4 years with below-average temperatures nationally, the wettest in 8 years and the snowiest in 30 years. Correspondingly, our spring seasonal products were flat to the prior year, well below our expectations.\nSales in the quarter benefited in the high-single digits from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price changes that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not lapped as of yet. The benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by 3 key factors: First, the majority of the pressure on average ticket all revolved around seasonal goods. This includes the softness in big ticket declines in seasonal, which runs at a higher average ticket and higher winter clearance. Second, faster growth in consumable transactions, in particular companion animal and poultry, which typically have a lower average ticket.\nAnd then third, to a lesser extent, a reduction in units per transaction in impulser add-on items like dog treats and candy and snacks.\nMoving down our income statement. Gross margin was 35.5%, an increase of 52 basis points from 34.9% last year. We were very pleased with these results. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. Promotional activity was in line with last year with a modest increase in winter clearance as we looked to exit the season clean. Moderating freight costs for import and domestic shipments provided a net gross margin benefit. Our price management initiatives and lower freight costs more than offset the impact from cost inflation and product mix from the robust growth of our CUE categories.\nAs a percent of sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 119 basis points to 28.1% from 26.9% a year ago. For perspective, about half of this growth was anticipated for our strategic initiatives. As a reminder, our planned investments included higher depreciation and amortization from the step-up in capital spending to support our growth agenda, and the addition of our new distribution center and the impact from the Orscheln acquisition. The remaining increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to deleverage given the moderate comparable store sales growth.\nAs we've mentioned, the quarter was trending in line with our expectations, leading up to the last 3 weeks of March, providing limited opportunities to adjust the cost structure. Specifically, we chose to continue to fully fund payroll for the last 2 weeks of the quarter to support the spring season, utilizing the hours to get ahead on product assembly and other sales driving tasks. For the quarter, operating income was essentially flat with last year, with a modest decline in net income. Diluted EPS was $1.65, also flat with the prior year's first quarter. We opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and 3 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the first quarter. This represents a significant improvement in the cadence of our new store openings.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 12% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, a better in-stock position from last year and the delay in the spring selling season. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2.0x.\nOur guidance for 2023 is unchanged. We continue to expect full year sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion and project comparable store sales to increase 3.5% to 5.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see comp sales towards the top half of our guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate some increased pressure on discretionary categories, but are pleased with the growth in CUE products along with DIY categories like repairs and maintenance.\nLet me share further insights on the outlook for the remainder of the year. We anticipate Q2 and Q3 to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while Q4 is expected to be closer to the low end of the guidance range due to the strong compares to the prior year. Operating margin performance is expected to improve as we move through the year with Q4 having the highest potential, principally from the lap of the onetime acquisition-related costs of Orscheln. As a reminder, our Navarre, Ohio, distribution center is expected to begin to benefit gross margin in the second quarter with the ramp up in the second half of the year as we capture freight savings.\nThe benefits in gross margin will be offset by approximately 15 basis points of negative drag on SG&A as the cost of the distribution center are reflected in SG&A.\nWe have confidence in our earnings in a variety of sales scenarios. For example, at times, a cooler and wetter start to the spring can provide an extended selling season. We've seen this type of seasonal cadence before such as 2013, and we are cautiously optimistic of the upside it can bring to the third quarter. Regardless of the state of the consumer, we are confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to manage the business.\nIn a scenario where we do not make up [ mix ] January sales, we see opportunities for further operating leverage. Specifically, we are seeing an easing of our supply chain capacity constraints, which should drive additional efficiencies in the second half. And we now anticipate greater accretion for Orscheln in the back half. We are raising our accretion assumption to $0.15 per share compared to our prior expectation of $0.10 per share.\nTo sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.13 billion to $1.17 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $10.30 to $10.60. Over my 23 years with Tractor Supply, it has been proven time after time weather can be transitory. And the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, Macy's, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. Throughout our 85-year history, we have successfully navigated all types of business environments and have emerged stronger each time. We continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. This marks the third consecutive year of positive population growth in rural America. This reflects an increased desire to seek out more space and take advantage of the affordability that country suburban, ex-urban and rural markets offer with a lower cost of living and the ability to live Life Out Here.\nIt is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price, has ensured the rural migration trend is 1 that's here to stay for the time being.\nThe millennial generation has embraced Life Out Here. Our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower macroeconomic growth, elevated inflation and higher interest rates, and they prioritize their lifestyle and passions. With significant growth and market share opportunities, we are excited about the balance of the year and remain confident in our business.\nMy thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you so much."

If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back in the queue. I appreciate your cooperation. We will be available after the call for follow-up. Thank you for your time and attention this morning.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin by thanking the Tractor Supply team for again delivering strong results. In some ways, this quarter may have been our best relative performance over the course of the last 2 years. The team demonstrated grit and determination as they overcame the lapping of last year's robust performance, the impacts of the Omicron variants, particularly in January, the significant inflationary pressures and the ongoing supply chain constraints, the last 2 of which were both exacerbated by the tragic conflict in Ukraine.\nNo matter what came at the team, they stepped up to the challenge to be there for our customers as a dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. Our team members, our vendors and other supply chain partners have continued to rise to the occasion as we strive to live our mission and values every day.\nSpeaking of our mission and values, in recognition of Earth Week this week, we issued our Stewards of Life Out Here Sustainability Report. This comprehensive report provides detailed information and progress on our ESG efforts. It significantly enhances our transparency and disclosure related to our environmental sustainability actions. Of note in the report is the establishment of a new water usage goal to reduce on an absolute level, our water footprint by 25 million gallons by 2025. ESG makes great business sense for Tractor Supply and setting targets for ourselves in these areas creates long-term value and allows us to have a positive impact on the world and the communities that we call home.\nAs a purpose-driven company, we remain committed to constant improvement on this journey.\nLet's turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2022. The year started out on a strong note. We grew net sales by 8.3% with comparable store sales up 5.2%. Diluted EPS was $1.65, an increase of 6.5% year-over-year. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.7%, offset by a decline in transactions of 1.4%. Given the remarkable strength of our business last year, and as a reminder, we had a 38.6% comp in Q1 last year. We are very pleased with our sales growth.\nLast year, we shared with you that we materially benefited the quarter from a combination of factors, in particular, stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. This quarter, we successfully navigated the lapping of these factors despite the spring season getting off to a slow start. On inflation, it benefited sales in the quarter by about 10 percentage points. As we shared in our last earnings call, we felt there was more pressure to the upside on inflation as we entered the quarter, and that is certainly what we saw.\nWe continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories as well as the underlying variables like higher wage labor wage rates and transport costs that are impacting our vendor partners.\nShifting to CUE. We experienced impressive demand in our consumable, usable and edible categories. As a reminder, these products are need-based and demand-driven and they're what drive trips into our stores. Our CUE sales growth was almost 3x our overall sales growth rate. Our CUE customer trends have never been stronger.\nKind of rounding out the business, seasonal category performance was mixed as we had solid performance in our winter season categories during a much colder January, but our spring season categories performed below average due to colder weather temperatures in the month of March.\nShifting to e-commerce. E-commerce again saw double-digit growth, and this represented our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit or better growth in e-commerce. We are making great strides in expanding our digital presence. Of note, our mobile app now represents more than 15% of our digital sales. This quarter, we crossed 3 million downloads of the Tractor Supply app. And this is a major milestone in our ONETractor strategy and our ability to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience.\nOur Neighbor's Club program reached a record 24.8 million members in the quarter, an increase of 24% from last year's first quarter. It seems like much longer than a year ago, but we recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the relaunch of Neighbor's Club to a points-based loyalty program. The relaunch has been an overwhelming success as it has measurably encouraged customers to migrate their spending upwards. Our Neighbor's Club members are comping at a faster overall rate than our overall company performance, and we're seeing strong growth and retention in our high-value customers.\nWe are confident in our business short term and long term. Last quarter, we shared with you several structural trends from which we're benefiting, including world revitalization, increased pet ownership, home setting and the rise in self-reliant. As the market leader, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from these structural trends. Additionally, we are seeing increasing momentum from our Life Out Here strategic initiatives enabling us to continue to gain share.\nAs we look forward, we believe we have many vectors for growth, and our business has never been stronger. That said, we acknowledge that there is significant uncertainty in the macro environment. We have a lot of the year still ahead of us. And in keeping with our long-standing practices prior to the pandemic, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half.\nOn the heels of last year's record performance and a strong start to the year, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year 2022. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. I'll briefly address the Orscheln acquisition. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update in the coming months. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nKurt D. Barton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. The Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. On a 2-year stack, our comparable store sales were 43.8%.\nLooking at the cadence of the quarter, January and February were the strongest months with March positive, albeit not a bit rate earlier in the quarter. We benefited from cold weather trends early in the quarter, while spring is late to break across most of the country. Please keep in mind, we were comping ideal weather conditions in the first quarter of last year with an early spring across many of our markets. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 10 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain.\nAs we shared with you last quarter, we anticipated this would be the toughest compare on transactions as we cycled the largest transaction gain since the beginning of the pandemic in Q1 of last year of 21%. To illustrate, we were experiencing positive comp transactions until we cycle the last 2 weeks of the quarter where we clearly saw the benefits of stimulus on transactions in the prior year. As we expected, big ticket decline given the robust performance we were cycling driven by stimulus and the early start to the spring selling season.\nLast year, as we reported, big-ticket comps significantly outperformed the chain average comps and on a 2-year stack, our big ticket performance exceeded the 43.8% comp growth of the chain. We continue to see strong CUE performance with strength in categories such as dry dog food, poultry, feed and heating fuel. For instance, dry dog food achieved over a 20% comp. Petsense performed above the company average, which was in line with our pet performance. Overall, we were very pleased with our top line performance.\nTurning now to gross margin, which outperformed our expectations. For the first quarter, our gross margin declined by 29 basis points to 34.9% of sales. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to 3 factors: significant product cost inflation, higher transportation costs and to a lesser extent, product mix. We continue to experience broad-based inflation while also seeing a step-up during the quarter in key commodities such as grains and oil, domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. We expect many of these trends in product cost and freight to continue throughout 2022.\nThe robust growth in our CUE categories, which have a lower gross profit rate did put some pressure on gross margin. The team did a remarkable job of managing these cost increases through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. Examples include capturing efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club.\nSG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 26.9%, an improvement of 11 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to the normalization of incentive compensation, moderation of COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and incremental costs related to our Life Out Here strategic investments for growth. This includes a step-up in our depreciation and amortization.\nPlease also keep in mind, given our results last year, we were cycling strong SG&A leverage, which benefited from 38.6% comp sales in the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $187 million, and diluted EPS was $1.65 compared to $1.55 in the first quarter of 2021. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Last quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 77% from $0.52 a share to $0.92. During the quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends.\nTurning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong and provides us the ability to invest in our business for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, along with our investment in inventory to support the growing demand.\nMoving now to our guidance for 2022, which is unchanged. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are reconfirming our guidance for the year. This includes net sales in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion with comparable store sales growth of 3% to 4.5%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. We continue to expect diluted EPS in a range of $9.20 to $9.50. We acknowledge that we beat our own expectations for the first quarter and that ongoing inflation should benefit our top line.\nWith the dynamic macro environment as a backdrop, we believe it's prudent to maintain our outlook for the year. Keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter of the year, and it's great to start out the year ahead of our expectations. We recognize that flowing the first quarter performance through may put pressure towards the top end of our guidance ranges. For those of you who followed us for some time, this is not a new convention to guidance and is in line with how we provided guidance historically prior to the pandemic.\nWe continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. With as much inflation pressures we're seeing in our business, we are closely watching comparable average ticket and transactions. We anticipate that the breakdown of growth may be a bit different than our prior expectations, given the high level of inflation benefiting average ticket with transactions seeing incremental pressure.\nHistorically, we've experienced trip consolidation by consumers during strong inflationary times. As inflation pressures persist, it puts higher pressure on gross margin, yet provides an offsetting benefit to SG&A leverage. As such, we're maintaining our expectations on our operating margin. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our outlook for 2022. The team is executing at a very high level we remain committed to investing in the business to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers. Our goals are to maintain our everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to drive strong shareholder returns for the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal.\n\nHarry A. Lawton\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tractor Supply Company\n\nThanks, Kurt. Last quarter at our enhanced earnings event, we shared significant details on our Life Out Here strategy. We believe we have a robust idiosyncratic drivers for growth over time. Our strategy is gaining traction and the team is executing well. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I'm going to provide an update on our customer, including our Neighbor's Club, and provide some highlights of our merchandising initiatives for the spring and summer season.\nOur customer trends are in great shape, and we're committed to capturing wallet share through legendary customer service, our numerous digital properties, our seamless shopping experience and our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Our customer base continues to be remarkably healthy and highly engaged with our brand. In our Q2 2020 earnings call, nearly 2 years ago, we discussed that our goal was to nurture and capitalizing on the generational growth we were seeing in our customer base, seizing on the opportunities to retain millions of new customers and expand share of wallet with our core customers and expand the number of capital categories shop by both customer sets. And I'm pleased to share with you today that, that's exactly what we're seeing in our customer base.\nOur active customer base is now much larger than coming into the pandemic as we have retained the majority of the millions of new customers that shopped us the last couple of years and our active customers are driving frequency and spending more money. On our new customers, we continue to see strong new customer acquisition with absolute run rates that are at pre-COVID levels and very stable.\nContinuing on a theme since 2020, our new customers continue to skew younger. We're seeing ongoing growth in our millennial shoppers as there's been a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by millennials. Since the start of the pandemic, the most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in the millennial customer supports the vibrancy and relevance of the Tractor Supply brand well into the future.\nAnother positive contributor to our strong sales growth has been our Neighbor's Club. As I mentioned earlier, the revamp of the program in April of last year from an Infinity program to a tiered points-based loyalty program has been rapidly adopted by our customers. Neighbor's Club is a significant growth platform for us. Notably, we reached our highest level of customers spending over $1,000 annually and we also reached our highest level of customers ever spending over $2,000 annually. Transactions, total sales and spend per active Neighbor's Club member all grew significantly in the quarter. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the structural tailwinds I mentioned earlier, such as rural revitalization, pet ownership, home setting and self-reliance.\nOur brand momentum is stronger than ever, and we're investing to ensure we continue to play offense in the context of these trends. The overall health of our customer base contributes to our confidence in our outlook for the year.\nLet's shift to spring. Our stores in e-commerce are well positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. As of today, we have over 175 garden centers, customer ready for spring. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lot and over 15% of our stores by the end of the year, where spring has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers' response to the expanded product offering and layout.\nTo capture incremental share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we've expanded our offerings of battery-powered outdoor power equipment. Tractor Supply is the exclusive retailer of the Greenworks Pro 60-volt platform which includes more than 75 battery-operated professional-grade residential tools, including zero-turn riding and push mowers, chainsaws, trimmers, leaf blowers, snow throwers and more.\nTractor Supply began offering Greenworks Pro 60-volt products online earlier this year, and we rolled them out in our stores the past few weeks. Notably, the addition of battery-operated zero-term lower from Greenworks strengthens our position as the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. This past Saturday, we hosted a Try Before You Buy Event at our stores that allowed our cost -- customers an opportunity to test drive our market-leading assortment and the various models in our stores.\nChick Days are always an exciting time in store and something that our customers look forward to with the change of seasons to spring. We sell millions of birds each year. And this year, we've expanded our breed options as well as widened our coop, feed and care assortment. This is a great example of a home stating category for our new millennial customer who's adopting the Out Here Lifestyle. And importantly, our store teams have the knowledge to help a customer in the category, whether they are novice or an expert.\nWe have a leading lineup of top selling, highest quality tools that are relative to our customers. Last week, we announced the addition of Dremel and Bosch to our power tool line up just in time for spring. As mentioned on several previous calls, a key component of Project Fusion is an expansion of our assortment in truck, tool and hardware. Our lineup and tools now includes Makita, DEWALT, PORTER-CABLE exclusively, Bosch and Dremel. We are much more of a destination now for our customers in this category. And as an aside, we're also on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year-end.\nTo wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making incredible progress for laying the foundation for the future. Track Supply has a proven business model. that has been resilient over numerous different types of business cycles with significant growth and market share opportunities ahead of us, it's an exciting time to be at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go off to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day.\nAnd now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

    "content": "Full Year 2022 Tesco PLC Earnings Call\n\nFull Year 2022 Tesco PLC Earnings Call\n\nTSCOLONDONAPR 13, 4:00 AM\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director, Tesco PLC\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our preliminary results presentation. I'm joined by our CFO, Imran Nawaz. And in a few moments, I'll give a brief introduction. Imran will then talk you through the full year results. And after that, I'll update you on the progress we've made against our strategic priorities as well as talking to you about the current market environment and our outlook for the year. We then allowed plenty of time for Q&A at the end.\nWe all know that it has been an extraordinary year. I'm really proud that throughout all of the challenges and changes, we have stayed resolutely focused on our customers. Our commitment to value has been unwavering, and we have delivered market-leading availability. All of these efforts have resulted in continued strong growth, building on our momentum and helping us to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger business. This has only been possible, thanks to the brilliant work of the entire Tesco team. And I want to thank every one of them for going the extra mile for our customers. It has been fantastic, being able to get around and meet many more colleagues over the last year, and I feel very privileged to work alongside them.\nI'm delighted that in agreement with Asda in the U.K., we have been able to agree a substantial new pay deal for our U.K. store colleagues as well as a further thank you payment in recognition of colleagues' amazing contribution last year. Our future success depends on our colleagues, and our commitment to them has never been stronger.\nBefore I reflect on business performance, I wanted to take a moment to speak about the war in Ukraine. All of those affected are in our thoughts. We were really quick to respond, together with our colleagues and customers, doing whatever we could to help. Our teams in Central Europe started to transport donations of food and other essential items to the border within hours of the conflict starting as well as supporting the logistics and supply chain capability at the border.\nTo date, we have supplied nearly 1,000 pallets of food for humanitarian organizations and are helping in other ways to, such as making it easier for refugees to access job opportunities and removing all charges from calls and money transfers to Ukraine. As always, the generosity of Tesco colleagues and customers is incredible. Together, we have raised almost GBP 4 million to support the vital work of the Red Cross as well as more than GBP 500,000 for humanitarian organizations in Central Europe.\nSince I presented our results to you 12 months ago, our business has dealt with a remarkable amount of external change. We have continued to support customers and colleagues through the pandemic, navigated significant industry disruption and further improved our competitive position despite inflation starting to bite. You can see on the slide the contribution we have been able to make on so many different levels, helped by the efforts of our colleagues, the capability of our supply chain and the strength and depth of our relationship with our supplier partners.\nTurning to our business performance. As I set out in October, customer satisfaction is critical to our success. It is the best measure of whether the efforts we are taking are being recognized by customers and underpins our ability to grow in the medium term.\nOver the past year, we have made conscious investments to strengthen the shopping trip for customers, such as expanding Aldi Price Match and ensuring we had sufficient resource to keep products on the shelf throughout the industry supply chain challenges. I'm really pleased to say that these efforts have been recognized. Our level of outperformance for our customers recommending Tesco versus other supermarkets has further improved over the course of the year.\nAs you'll see here, our brand's Net Promoter Score has also continued to strengthened. As you know, holding our growing market share in our core U.K. market is really important to us. It provides us with the scale and reach to serve more customers, however, wherever and whenever they choose to shop.\nThis year, we gained market share in every single month. Importantly, our outperformance was even stronger in volume terms than in value as we held back inflation. You can see that this is set against a market share decline for the rest of the big 4, which is even more marked in volume terms. We had our longest unbroken run of switching gains, too, with 23 consecutive periods where we picked up trade from our competitors. Progress against this measure isn't linear, and you should expect it to move around quite a bit, particularly as we see some normalization in the market.\nWe are pleased with our market share performance across our other markets, too. Ireland has driven an improvement of 11 basis points as we have strengthened our value offering and focused on making shopping easier for customers. In Booker, while there isn't a defined market share metric for the wholesale market, we're really pleased with both our customer retention and our rate of new customer acquisition.\nWe also saw an improvement in market share in Central Europe. As you can see, we've delivered improvements in quality, customer satisfaction and brand perception, too. with all 3 businesses benefiting from leveraging the group's scale and capabilities.\nOver to you, Imran.\n\nImran Nawaz\n\nCFO & Director, Tate & Lyle Plc\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with an overview of performance, followed by some more color on trends and drivers. Throughout my review, percentage growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless stated otherwise.\nIn the year, we have delivered a very strong performance in all of our key metrics across the group. Group sales grew by 3% on a 1-year basis and by 10.2% on a 2-year basis with a strong performance across all regions on top of exceptional sales last year. Group profit increased by 58.9% to GBP 2.8 billion. This reflects the strong sales performance across the retail businesses, a reduction in COVID-19 costs and a return to profitability in the bank, partially offset by inflationary pressures in the cost base and ongoing investment in the customer proposition.\nYou'll remember that at the half, we introduced a simpler retail free cash flow measure. And on this basis, retail free cash flow was GBP 2.3 billion, up GBP 0.9 billion on last year. This was driven by higher retail operating profits, the elimination of the U.K. pension contribution following our one-off contribution last year and a working capital benefit from higher sales, partly offset by an increase in capital expenditure.\nNet debt at the end of the year was GBP 10.5 billion, GBP 1.4 billion lower than last year, primarily driven by the strong free cash flow generation. In line with our targeted payout ratio of circa 50% of earnings, we have proposed a final dividend of 7.7p per ordinary share, taking the full year dividend to 10.9p per ordinary share, an increase of 19.1%.\nOur headline earnings per share of 21.86 represents an improvement of 88.8% with the recovery in retail and bank profits more than offsetting the higher tax charge. Total retail sales for the year were GBP 53.8 billion with profit of GBP 2.6 billion. Both our U.K. and Ireland and Central Europe segments delivered a strong profit recovery with quantum profits exceeding 19, 20 levels for each segment. Tesco Bank generated GBP 176 million of profit compared to a loss of GBP 175 million in the prior year.\nOver the next few slides, I will cover the performance of each of our segments in more detail, starting with sales before moving on to profit. Sales have shown good momentum in each of the U.K., Ireland and Booker businesses. You'll see the exceptional growth on a 2-year basis with substantially higher sales than before the pandemic.\nMore specifically, in the U.K., sales grew ahead of our expectations with like-for-like growth of 0.4%. Our relentless focus on value and service drove consistent outperformance against the market throughout the year. While we saw deflation over the year as a whole, our numbers do include some benefit from inflation in the second half.\nIn Ireland, while we delivered double-digit like-for-like growth on a 2-year basis, our 1-year like-for-like declined. We traded over an exceptionally strong comparative with restrictions on hospitality in place last year for longer than in the U.K. In Booker, 1-year like-for-like sales grew by 15.3% and driven by a sharp recovery in catering sales as the hospitality industry reopened. Retail was also resilient against a very tough base.\nI'll now break down sales by quarter and then give some color by channel and then by category. In terms of like-for-like growth through the year, you'll see that our U.K. and Ireland businesses followed a relatively similar shape. Q1 growth was impacted by the lapping of stockpiling and the first lockdown last year. This was followed by stronger growth in Q2 as we lapped a period of lower restrictions and with warmer weather, staycations and events such as the delayed Euro 2020 this year. Q3 and Q4 then have further lockdowns.\nBy contrast, for Booker, while sales quantums followed the typical seasonal shape with a summer peak, you'll see that growth rates built quarter-by-quarter throughout the year, following the phased reopening of hospitality from period 2.\nFocusing on our U.K. business, you'll see that we delivered a strong performance in our large stores throughout the year with some normalization in customer shopping behavior, resulting in higher levels of store footfall and discretionary spend. We have consistently focused on delivering a great customer shopping trip, investing to protect availability in light of the strong pressure on our supply chains. As anticipated, with some of our customers choosing to return to shopping in our stores, we did see a decline in online sales, especially as we lapped last year's peak demand in the second half.\nOur online business remains significantly larger than before the pandemic with 2-year like-for-like of 66%, which equates to GBP 2.3 billion of additional online sales. We were pleased that our convenience stores returned to growth in the second half, with a particularly strong growth in our on-the-go stores as city center footfall started recovering from Q2 onwards.\nTurning to performance by category. Food obviously reflects the majority of our business and, for the year as a whole, delivered sales that were slightly down, reflecting elevated levels of in-home consumption in our base.\nLooking across the year, we saw food sales declines in Q1 as we lap the start of the first lockdown and the period of stockpiling, followed by growth across both Q2 and Q3. In Q4, food sales did decline year-on-year, reflecting very strong comparators. We saw strong growth in both GM and clothing in the first half of the year, which reflects lower discretionary spend in the first lockdown last year and a benefit this year from the continued closure of nonessential retail.\nGrowth in clothing was particularly strong, especially in kids and leisure wear, as we continue to evolve our ranges to reflect changing customer demand. As a result, we were able to achieve a higher proportion of full-price sales supporting our profitability. Our nonfood performance also benefited from rebalancing our space in 116 stores over the last couple of years, making our clothing more of a destination and our GM ranges simpler and easier to shop. On a 2-year basis, we delivered growth across all 3 categories. 8.1% like-for-like in food, 1.6% in GM and 15.1% in clothing.\nTurning to Ireland, where sales were 10.6% higher than pre-pandemic with a strong performance across all categories and all channels. On a 1-year basis, our sales declined by 2.9% as we traded over a strong performance in the prior year, reflecting the market impact of stockpiling in Ireland and the longer period of restrictions on hospitality.\nWe continue to see strong growth in our online business, where we have increased geographic coverage and expanded click and collect locations from 28 to 65 stores. Online now represents 8% of our sales in Ireland.\nWe've announced our intention to acquire 10 Joyce's stores in Galway, providing us with a platform to reach more customers and to bring online to more locations in the West of Ireland. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect to complete this transaction this year.\nIn Booker, sales have grown strongly on both a 1-year and 2-year basis. Performance versus last year was driven by the sharp recovery of catering sales, which grew by 56.1% as the hospitality sector reopened for outdoor dining in April and indoor from mid-May onwards.\nGiven the level of COVID-19 distortion, I have included some quarterly charts here on a 2-year basis. You will see that our retail business has delivered very consistent growth on a 2-year basis, maintain the increased sales from last year. We are really encouraged by our strong customer retention supported by maintaining our keen focus on pricing.\nOur catering business recovered strongly from Q2 onwards, and we worked hard to mitigate the impact of significant supply chain challenges. Growth in Q4 was lower than in Q3 and due to the emergence of the Omicron variant and its impact on the restaurant industry.\nIn Central Europe, like-for-like sales were up 2.9% on a 1-year basis and 2.5% on a 2-year basis with growth across all channels and categories. In addition to some benefit from inflation, we saw a strong 1-year performance from nonfood. We were able to offer our full range following nonfood sales restrictions last year and saw customers returning to our large stores. In addition, we've doubled the size of our online business over the last 2 years, albeit from a relatively small base.\nMoving on to profit. As you can see on this graph, retail operating profit improved by GBP 686 million year-on-year to reach GBP 2.6 billion, driven by our U.K. and Ireland segment. In the U.K. and Ireland, profit growth of 35.4% was driven by a number of factors. In the U.K., COVID-19 cost reduced from GBP 892 million last year to GBP 220 million with this year's cost primarily relating to absence for those colleagues who were sick or self-isolating.\nWe benefited from a sales recovery in categories that were particularly impacted by COVID-19 last year, including margin-accretive categories such as clothing. We invested in customer shopping trip in price and service. Our efficiencies across the year mitigated the operating cost inflation that we saw coming through, especially towards the end of the year.\nIn Central Europe, profit was up 41.1%, again reflecting lower COVID-19 costs. Nonfood sales grew strongly, following the restrictions last year. And we benefited from higher mall income. As in the U.K., we continue to invest in our customer offer, and our operating efficiencies largely mitigated cost inflation.\nTurning to Tesco Bank. We have seen some recovery in volumes this year, driven by an increase in new business, although lending balances still remain below '19/'20 levels. The bank's return to profitability was predominantly driven by the year-on-year movements in bad debts. The profit also included a GBP 13 million contribution from Tesco underwriting, which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition that we completed back in May.\nAs you can see from the ratios on the slide, the balance sheet remains strong. As a result of the stronger performance this year, the bank paid an GBP 87 million dividend to Tesco Group, consisting of the usual GBP 50 million plus a catch-up of GBP 37 million in relation to the dividend paid last year.\nThis slide gives you more detail on the components of our statutory profit performance, which increased by 186% as higher adjusting items and tax charges were offset by a reduction in finance costs. Formerly known as exceptional items and now as adjusting items, we incurred GBP 265 million of adjusting charges in the year. As mentioned at the half, this was driven by GBP 193 million settlement relating to historic shareholder litigation claims, which was paid in full in the year.\nNet finance costs were GBP 542 million, including a fair value remeasurement credit of GBP 123 million, primarily relating to the mark-to-market movement on inflation-linked swaps, which was a significant change to the prior year. Before fair value remeasurements, net finance costs were GBP 58 million lower than last year at GBP 665 million, driven by lower net pension finance costs and a lower interest charge on lease liabilities.\nOur tax charge was GBP 510 million, up from GBP 104 million in the prior year. This reflects the growth in operating profit both in our retail business and in Tesco Bank. We also incurred a one-off charge due to revaluation of our deferred tax liability, following the increase to the U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%.\nMoving now to our cash performance. Based on the simplified definition that we introduced at the half year, we generated GBP 2.3 billion of retail free cash. And I'll talk you through the major components and year-on-year movements. Before working capital, you'll see that we generated GBP 4.3 billion of retail free cash from operations, an increase of just over GBP 1 billion. This reflects higher sales and lower COVID-19 costs as well as the benefit this year of GBP 351 million from no longer making contributions to the pension scheme, following our one-off contribution last year from the Asia disposal proceeds.\nOur total working capital inflow was GBP 501 million, mainly driven by a sharp recovery in fuel volumes and the recovery of Booker's catering business in the first half. Working capital in the second half was then broadly neutral with the typical seasonal unwind after the summer peak being offset by strong sales in the U.K. and higher fuel payables, reflecting both volume and cost price inflation.\nCapital expenditure was GBP 1.1 billion, in line with our guidance range, and we have provided the usual breakdowns by region and type in the appendices. This was GBP 148 million higher than last year's CapEx, reflecting more store openings across the U.K. and the continued expansion of our online proposition in both the U.K. and in Ireland. We paid GBP 641 million of interest costs, of which GBP 402 million related to finance charges on lease liabilities and GBP 239 million to interest paid on bank debt.\nCash tax paid was GBP 195 million, benefiting from 3 factors. First, a benefit of GBP 120 million from the one-off pension contribution last year following the disposal of our Asia business. Second, a benefit of around GBP 80 million from the new super deduction for certain capital investments, which was introduced in March 2021. And third, a benefit from the utilization of prior year losses. We expect the first 2 of these factors to recur in the coming year.\nWe received GBP 109 million in dividends from Tesco Bank and property joint ventures and purchased 144 million of shares in the market to offset dilution from share schemes.\nFinally, capital repayments of leases was GBP 571 million. I've included this next slide to describe the performance of items now outside our simplified definition of retail free cash flow. The net business acquisitions and disposals line here includes GBP 122 million of proceeds from the sale of our business in Poland to the selling group, which completed in March.\nNet property proceeds and purchases of GBP 228 million relate to GBP 308 million from the sale of properties, partially offset by an GBP 80 million outflow related to property buybacks. The property sales included the disposal of our Fenny Lock distribution center, along with the sale of properties in Poland that were not part of the corporate transaction with the selling group. Partly offsetting this, we bought back 1 extra store in [Berry] and a full stake in the Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership, bringing 11 stores into full ownership.\nAdjusting items principally cover the historic shareholder litigation claims that I mentioned earlier, which were fully settled in the year. On the previous definition, therefore, we generated GBP 2.3 billion of retail free cash flow compared to GBP 1.2 billion in the prior year. In the coming year, subject to regulatory approval, we expect our other cash items to include the cash consideration for Joyce's as well as a circa GBP 200 million proceeds from the sale of 17 malls and 1 retail park in Central Europe that we agreed this month.\nWe also exercised the option in February to buy back our partners' equity in the Tesco Dorney property joint venture, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this coming year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Total indebtedness was GBP 10.8 billion, down GBP 2.2 billion with all 3 components of indebtedness reducing year-on-year. Due to the impact of market movements on our pension assets, we carried a GBP 2.1 billion IAS 19 pension surplus at the end of the year in comparison to a GBP 1 billion deficit last year.\nIn line with our definition, this surplus is not included indebtedness. So the GBP 0.2 billion deficit that you see on the slide reflects only the pension schemes that are in a net deficit position. We also saw a GBP 0.9 billion reduction in net debt before lease liabilities, driven by our strong cash generation.\nFinally, lease liabilities themselves reduced to GBP 7.9 billion the purchase of our partner's stake in the Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership that I mentioned earlier as well as the sale of our Polish business. Our total indebtedness ratio was 2.5x compared to 3.6x last year. Our new leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA was 2.5x compared to 3.3x last year and is midway in our target leverage range of 2.3 to 2.8x.\nOur fixed charge cover was 3.5x, up from 2.9x. Along with higher retail EBITDA, the reduction in lease interest payments and lease capital and prepayments more than offset a small increase in net finance costs.\nI wanted to close by talking about shareholder returns. We've delivered a strong performance this year across sales, profit and cash generation, and this does, of course, flow into shareholder returns. First, in line with our targeted payout ratio of circa 50% of earnings, I'm pleased that the proposed full year dividend is an increase of 19.1% at 10.9p per ordinary share. This increase reflects the growth in retail and bank operating profits, partly offset by the impact from last year's dividend policy exception. As I mentioned in October, we intend to pay a progressive dividend going forward.\nSecond, having launched our ongoing buyback program in October, we have already purchased GBP 300 million worth of Tesco shares to date. I'm pleased to be able to confirm today a commitment to buy back a total of GBP 750 million worth of shares over the next 12 months.\nThank you very much for your time. I'll now hand back to Ken.\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director, Tesco PLC\n\nThank you, Imran. Now to our strategic priorities. As a reminder, these are the 4 priorities we shared with you in October: Magnetic value for customers, I love my Tesco Clubcard, Easily the most convenient and safe to invest. I strongly believe in letting our customers see any new initiatives ahead of our competitors. So we won't be sharing any specific details of our future plans, but I will give you a sense of the progress we have made under each priority.\nPrice is a critical component of magnetic value, and we have been unwavering in our commitment to keep prices as low as possible for our customers. Although we could not have foreseen all of the increasing pressures that consumers are starting to face, our efforts over the last 18 months or so have put us in a really strong position to help. You can see from the chart that we have strengthened our competitiveness throughout this year, reaching our strongest relative price position for many years. As a result, we are much better placed than we were the last time the market experienced significant levels of inflation.\nImportantly, customers are recognizing this, too. Our value perception has gone from strength to strength. Over the last couple of years, you can see a meaningful gap opening up between ourselves and the rest of the big 4 supermarkets over 5 full percentage points. So how have we achieved this? As you know, our value proposition is made of 3 key elements, which together form a powerful combination.\nAldi Price Match clearly plays an important role. It is serving its purpose really well, removing price as a reason to shop anywhere other than Tesco. The rigor with which we have made sure that our customers never lose out and the expansion of the basket to 650 lines in October have made it a really powerful part of the proposition.\nTo give you a sense of just how important it is, Aldi Price Match items feature in 99% of weekly shops in our large stores, providing savings for millions of customers week in, week out. Clubcard Prices have also landed really well with customers. From the initial trials back in September 2020, we have now moved all of our promotions onto the scheme. As well as providing customers with a really clear sense of how much they are saving, it also enables us to negotiate the very best discounts for them with our suppliers.\nThe most recent addition to Clubcard Prices was our iconic lunchtime meal deal. This allowed us to keep the price at an inflation busting GBP 3 for anyone using their Clubcard, at least 50p cheaper than most of our competitors and at the same price as it was 10 years ago.\nFinally, the relaunch of low everyday prices, which benchmarks around 1,600 products to the cheapest available alternative base price, with a particular emphasis on household and health and beauty. This removes the need for customers to shop around on an even wider range of everyday products.\nMagnetic value is also about ensuring that we are offering our customers fantastic quality. I'm delighted that we've been able to step forward on this front, too, particularly in a year with so many supply chain challenges.\nOn the product development side, we launched over 300 new products in the year, including adding a significant number of new seasonal lines to our Christmas range. We have also continued to work on reformulation, improving the quality of over 500 lines. Finest is a key focus for us as it offers customers the chance to trade into more premium products without needing to shop elsewhere. At a time when customers are recalibrating their choices as to whether to ease in or out, it's really important to have a great offer to suit every meal occasion.\nThe finest range includes around 2,000 products and grew by 9.3% this year. It generated sales of GBP 1.7 billion, making it the U.K.'s largest premium food own brand. As a result of our efforts so far, you can see from the chart that we delivered an improvement in quality perception this year against the market trend. You may remember that we launched ambitious new health commitments across all of our markets a year ago.\nOver the course of the year, we have continued our reformulation program, looking at ways to improve the nutritional characteristics each time we touch a product, either reducing the fat, sugar and salt content or increasing dietary fiber. In total, we have removed a further 7.7 billion calories from our own brand ranges this year.\nDemand for plant-based products has remained high. Since our 2018 baseline, we have now grown sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 130% in the U.K. In December, we launched a range of Wicked Kitchen vegan products through our Booker retail partners, and we have introduced Plant Chef 2, all of our 3 Central European markets.\nAlthough we clearly made good progress on each of these initiatives, our overall percentage of healthy food has held flat for 2 key reasons. First, with more customers eating at home, we have seen some of their less healthy choices transfer from restaurants into retailers. Second, the temporary consolidation of ranges to support availability throughout the industry supply chain issues has had an effect.\nWe remain committed to moving the percentage up in the coming year and are progressing well with our trials ahead of the forthcoming HFSS legislation. The final component of magnetic value is sustainability. Increasingly, customers see this as a given for whomever they choose to shop with. We launched our ambitious new climate commitments in September, bringing forward our net zero commitments for our own operations across the group to 2035 and launching a new Scope 3 target of 2050.\nWe were proud to launch the U.K.'s first electric HGVs in January and to be the first to pilot them in Hungary and the Czech Republic. We're also making good progress on electric.com brands. For customers, our network of EV charging points is now in 500 stores, providing over 2 million free charging sessions to date.\nOn plastic, we have now removed over 1.6 billion pieces of plastic from our operations, and we're the first retailer to roll out a nationwide soft plastic recycling program in the U.K. We're also supporting innovations such as our trial with appeal on citrus fruit, which aims to minimize both plastic and food waste.\nOur community efforts always get great support. Under our Buy One to Help a Child campaign, we made a donation for every piece of fruit and veg that customers bought over a period of 3 weeks. This enabled us to donate the equivalent of 3 million extra meals on top of the 53 million donated through our usual food redistribution programs.\nMoving now to the second of our strategic priorities: I Love my Tesco Clubcard. This priority is about combining the power of the Clubcard, our online grocery business and our increasing digital relationships with customers to create a powerful digital platform. In doing so, we can unlock new value for our customers, for our suppliers and for Tesco in the form of new incremental income streams.\nClubcard Prices has been a key enabler of this, encouraging more and more customers to use an app to interact with Clubcard. This drives greater frequency of interaction, enables a much more immediate relationship between earning, checking and spending Clubcard points. You can see on this chart how the number of regular app users has increased more than fourfold over the last 2 years to GBP 9 million.\nIt is also worth noting that we have been leveraging the same capabilities across the group, with Clubcard Prices launching in our other markets, in Tesco Mobile and in Tesco Bank. As a result, Clubcard penetration has continued to increase. Customers are swiping, tapping or scanning their Clubcards on 3/4 of all U.K. Tesco transactions, and we expect this to further increase over the coming months. This greater level of engagement is allowing us to improve the customer experience of Clubcard, too, with personalized coupons and increasingly relevant rewards.\nOur third priority is easily the most convenient, serving our customers wherever, whenever and however they want. It's about keeping our existing estate relevant for customers while seeking out capital-light growth in convenience and online.\nTesco has emerged from the pandemic a much stronger business, and nowhere is this more true than online. As expected, we have seen some normalization but we are still seeing around 1.2 million orders each week, over 60% higher than pre-pandemic.\nBasket sizes are up, too, and online groceries still represent nearly 14% of the total U.K. sales, about 5% more than 2 years ago. This is a testament to the brilliant work the team did to open up our capacity when customers needed us most in the first few months of the pandemic and their continued efforts to maintain an outstanding service to our customers over the last 2 years. As a result, we gained 1 million new customers to Tesco, and around 67% of those are continuing to shop with us either online or in store.\nI should stress that the normalization we are seeing is an industry feature. And in fact, we are retaining more of the uplift in trade than others. From an exceptionally strong base last year, we have further increased our online market share by over 140 basis points. We continue to lead the online market in the Republic of Ireland with a share of 59%, and our online business in Central Europe has grown strongly.\nWhile we are expecting further normalization in the current year, we see online as one of our key medium-term growth opportunities. We now have 4 urban fulfillment centers open, and our fifth in Rutherglen open next month. We've seen the 2 most recent sites following a faster ramp-up trajectory than either West Bromwich or Lakeside.\nIn addition to providing extra capacity to allow our grocery home shopping business to grow, UFCs also improve the economics. Our UFC pick rates are around 4x the rate of manual picking.\nAnother area we are focusing on from an economic point of view is click and collect. Having peaked at around 25% of orders during the pandemic, we are still seeing around double the proportion of click and collect than we had 2 years ago. This year, we have rolled out an additional 102 locations for customers to be able to pick up their groceries and are continuing to refine the customer experience.\nOur superfast home delivery service, Tesco Whoosh, is now in 200 stores. While we are still not certain of the scale of demand in this part of the market, our aim is to make sure that if customers do want the convenience of having their shopping delivered within a very short period of time, they can do so without leaving the Tesco ecosystem. We plan to roll this service out to 600 stores in this financial year, with further refinements to the customer offer being trialed along the way. We have pushed on with our convenience opening program, opening 40 new Express stores and 59 new One Stops. In the coming year, our opening program will take us to a total of over 2,000 Express stores and over 1,000 One Stops. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to make our larger stores even more compelling for customers, with concession partners including Decathlon, YO! Sushi and Homebase.\nBooker's catering business has coped brilliantly with the challenges of the pandemic and is emerging a stronger business. Over 37,000 new catering customers were added in the last year alone. It is also continuing to build on its partnership with Just Eat, and the retail business is performing well, too.\nAlthough the majority of our growth in stores is in convenience, I would like to mention our planned acquisition of 10 Joyce's supermarkets in the Republic of Ireland. These stores provide us with a unique opportunity to grow share in the Galway region, and we look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to the Tesco Ireland family, subject to regulatory approval.\nOur final strategic priority is safe to invest. You've already heard from Imran that cost efficiency is not new to Tesco. It's in our DNA to ensure that everything we are doing and every pound we are spending is in the service of our customers. That's more critical now than ever. We set ourselves the goal of being able to offset the impact of cost inflation on our business each year and ideally create additional headroom that will allow us to invest in competitiveness and growth. We identified GBP 1 billion of savings over 3 years, broadly evenly phased with the key areas of opportunity, being goods and services not for resale, property, improved operational efficiency and central overheads.\nSince we constructed the plan, the external environment has changed and cost inflation has rapidly accelerated. This is certainly spurring us on, and we will do everything we can to increase the overall pace and scale of the forward program, particularly in the first year. We have already delivered a number of changes that will result in lower costs in the coming year as well as better reflecting how our customers shop with us.\nFor example, we removed counters from a further 317 stores in February and have been introducing more card-only tills and increasing the efficiency of checkouts. We also moved replenishment from nights to days in a number of stores, enabling more colleagues to be available on the shop floor to help customers at peak times. Closing our Jack's format and unifying our leadership structure in clothing and general merchandise also help simplify our business.\nI wanted to close by talking about the current market environment. We know that this is a really challenging time for many of our customers, facing the biggest increase to the cost of living that we've seen in decades. Over 70% of customers say that inflation is a serious concern for them and real incomes are forecast to fall by almost 4% this year.\nAs you would expect, this has impact shopper confidence, which has fallen sharply since the start of 2022 on top of any uncertainties around the emergence from the pandemic. You can see from this chart that many customers are already planning changes to the way they shop, and we will make sure that we are there to support them.\nOwn brand will play an important role, and we continue to make sure that we have the strongest range and the best possible prices across every tier and every category. We need to stay close to our suppliers too, with the crisis in Ukraine straining availability and adding to the cost of ingredients, particularly in commodities such as wheat and sunflower oil. The strength of our supply chain and our strong supplier relationships put us in an excellent position relative to others, but we do need to recognize and respond to the challenges being faced by the industry.\nAgainst this backdrop, it's essential that we keep listening to our customers. Value is going to be critical. And I see 3 immediate priorities as we look to the year ahead. We will stay laser-focused on price. We will not allow price to become a reason for customers to shop any world than Tesco. We will also make sure we have a compelling offer for those customers looking to save by eating in, instead of eating out. Feeding the family out of home can be a big expense, and we will make sure that we can provide a brilliant alternative at great value.\nFinally, we recognize that customer needs will change. Despite having spent 2 years waiting to emerge from the pandemic, many customers are likely to want to economize on travel and the staycation may be with us for longer than we thought. Again, we will make sure our ranges are in tune and our offer strong throughout.\nSo what does that mean for next year given the significant external uncertainties, we have given our profit guidance in the form of a wider than usual range. Our current best view is, therefore, that we will deliver between GBP 2.4 million and GBP 2.6 billion of retail adjusted operating profit next year. We've highlighted in the release the 3 main factors that are likely to influence our actual performance.\nAs we don't want to pretend, we have any certain how they will plan out. Clearly, there are levers we could pull to land on a certain level of profit, but that's not what we're about. We are running the business to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders for the long term. If we can do better, we will, or if we think it needs to change, we'll let you know. What we can tell you with certainty is that we will stay focused on our customers throughout as that's the best way to deliver the medium-term growth and the strong sustainable cash flows that we have set out. We are confident that we can keep this level of cash generation sustainable into the future, and are therefore pleased to commit to a further GBP 750 million capital return under our share buyback program to be completed by no later than April 2023.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our strong performance in what has been an extraordinary year. We have really good momentum and start from a position of strength with our most competitive positioning for many, many years. We will maintain our unwavering commitment to value and continue to support our customers and colleagues when they need us most.\nIn uncertain times, we will prioritize the right decisions to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. By doing the right things for our customers and colleagues, we will continue to drive value for our shareholders and remain firmly committed to returning cash through the buyback program.\nThank you for your time so far. Imran and I are now really happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Just to remind you, this call is being recorded. I am now pleased to introduce Mr. Ken Murphy, CEO; and Mr. Imran Nawaz, CFO. Please go ahead with your presentation.\n\nKen Murphy\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director, Tesco PLC\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and a very happy new year to you all. .\nThank you for joining us on what I know is a very busy day for you. I'm here in Welling with Imran. And in a moment, we'll be delighted to take your questions.\nBefore that, I want to make a few opening remarks. I'm not planning on running through everything that's in the statement, but I will call out a few highlights.\nI want to start this morning by thanking every one of our fantastic colleagues. The momentum in our business is really thanks to their hard work and commitment. Given all of the challenges over the last few years, what they've achieved is truly remarkable. I want them to know their contribution is highly appreciated. I'd like to also say a big thank you to our suppliers, who helped us do a brilliant job for our customers throughout.\nWe are really pleased with our performance over the third quarter and particularly over the Christmas period.\nTo grow on top of last year's exceptional performance, with nearly 9% like-for-like sales on a 2-year stack, is a fantastic result and even ahead of our own expectations. Overall, COVID actually had a negative impact on like-for-like sales performance due to the pretty comprehensive lockdown we had last year. However, we did have a short-term boost in sales versus our own expectations as more customers stayed home due to the Omicron variant this Christmas.\nImportantly, our underlying momentum continues to be strong. Our unwavering commitment to value is continuing to resonate with customers. And they are recognizing the improvements we are making in range and quality, too. These factors have all contributed to our strong market share performance, both in stores and online, with switching gains in the U.K. for 22 consecutive periods.\nAlthough we end up focusing a lot on the U.K. business on these calls, I would like to touch on performance across the group.\nOur Irish business has delivered another exceptionally strong performance. Booker has delivered record sales in both retail and catering despite the hospitality challenges. And Central Europe is growing well and gaining share.\nWe are clearly navigating some significant challenges, including growing cost pressures and the well-documented supply chain issues in the industry. The recent wave of Omicron has also led to increased absence. But despite this, our outperformance in sales has led us to increase our guidance for this year. We now expect retail operating profit to be slightly above the top end of our previous range of GBP 2.5 billion to GBP 2.6 billion. We are also expecting our bank operating profit to be higher than previously guided and now between GBP 160 million and GBP 200 million.\nLooking further ahead, we know the environment will continue to be challenging and the impact from COVID is far from clear. What I can tell you is that we are absolutely committed to continuing to deliver great value for customers, and that the momentum in our business gives us even more confidence in the medium-term ambitions we set out in October.\nSo with that, let's go straight to Q&A."

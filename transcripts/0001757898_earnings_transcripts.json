My name is Bella, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to STERIS plc 2Q Fiscal 2026 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Bella, and good morning, everyone. Speaking on today's call this morning will be Karen Burton, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO, and we do have a few words of caution before we open for comments.\nThis webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the express written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available to the company and on our website.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our press release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making.\nWith those cautions, I will hand the call over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Burton\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance from continuing operations. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue grew 10%. Constant currency organic revenue grew 9% in the quarter, driven by volume as well as 210 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.3%. Positive price and productivity, primarily driven by volume more than offset increased inflation and tariff costs.\nEBIT margin increased 90 basis points to 23.1% of revenue compared with the second quarter last year, mainly driven by operating expense leverage. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by changes in discrete item adjustments and geographic mix.\nNet income from continuing operations in the quarter was $244.5 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $2.47, a 15% increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2026 totaled $180.1 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $241.1 million. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in total debt. Gross to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.2x. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2026 was $527.7 million, a very strong start to the year, driven by the increase in earnings and improvements in working capital.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter and our increased outlook.\nKaren [ reported ] the quarter at a high level, so I will add some commentary on the segments. Starting with health care. Constant currency organic revenue grew 9% in the second quarter, with growth across all categories. Service continued its streak of outperformance, growing 13% in the second quarter. Consumables also performed well with growth of 10%.\nHealthcare capital equipment revenue increased 4% in the quarter with backlog of over $400 million. Orders were up 3% year-to-date and down slightly in the second quarter. EBIT margins for health care in the quarter increased 100 basis points to 25.1%, with volume, pricing, positive productivity and restructuring program benefits offsetting tariffs and inflation.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 7% for the quarter with 13% growth in services, offset by anticipated declines in capital equipment revenue. Services benefited from stable medical device volumes, bioprocessing demand and currency. EBIT margins for AST were 45.3%, up 250 basis points from second quarter last year as additional volume, pricing and less capital equipment in the mix were able to more than offset increases in labor and energy.\nConstant currency organic revenue increased 12% for Life Sciences in the quarter driven by a return of capital equipment shipments with growth of 39%. Service revenues grew 9% and consumables increased 7%. Capital equipment backlog was up over 50% to $114 million. Margins declined 70 basis points as volume and price were more than offset by tariffs and inflation.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we grew the bottom line 15% in the quarter to $2.47 per diluted share. Included in that number is approximately $12 million of pretax tariff impact, which primarily impacted our Healthcare segment.\nTurning to our outlook for fiscal 2026. As noted in the press release, based on our first half outperformance and expectations for the balance of the year, we are increasing most elements of our outlook. We now anticipate approximately 8% to 9% as reported revenue growth, which reflects about 100 basis points of favorable currency, a significantly lower impact than we anticipated last quarter. Making up for the shift in currency impact, constant currency organic revenue growth is now expected to be 7% to 8%, an increase of 100 basis points from our prior outlook. This improvement was driven by our first half outperformance. We now expect all 3 segments to grow 7% to 8% on a constant currency organic basis for the year.\nFor AST, we now expect services to grow 9% to 10%, which will be offset by anticipated declines in capital equipment, particularly versus the tough comparisons in the fourth quarter.\nWe are also increasing our earnings outlook with a new range of $10.15 to $10.30. For your modeling purposes, we now expect EBIT margins to improve 10 to 20 basis points in fiscal 2026. This will be partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in our anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 24%.\nWe are also increasing our outlook for free cash flow by $30 million to $850 million for fiscal 2026. CapEx remains unchanged at about $375 million. We are pleased with our strong start to the year, and we are confident in our ability to meet these revised expectations.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so that we can begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Karen and Dan, for your comment. Bella, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance from continuing operations.\nFor the first quarter, total as reported revenue grew 9%. Constant currency organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter, driven by volume as well as 230 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points compared with prior year to 45.3%. Positive price and productivity outpaced inflation and tariff costs.\nEBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 22.8% of revenue compared with the first quarter of last year due to the improvement in gross margin and operating expense leverage. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by geographic mix and changes in discrete item adjustments.\nNet income from continuing operations in the quarter was $231.2 million, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.34, a 15% improvement compared to the prior year.\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 totaled $94 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $119 million. We continued to pay down debt during the quarter, ending with $1.9 billion in total debt.\nGross debt to EBITDA at quarter end was 1.2x.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was $327 million, a very strong start to the fiscal year, driven by an increase in earnings and improvements in working capital.\nLast week, we announced our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases with a 10% increase to $0.63 per quarter as we continue to prioritize consistent dividend growth.\nBefore I close, I'm sure that you all read last night's release regarding our CFO transition. I want to take a moment to thank all of you for your continued support over the last 17 years, actually 18 years if you count the time I served as interim CFO. The time -- the company has grown significantly during that time in terms of revenue and profitability, being able to provide not only financial leadership, but also to provide strategic oversight throughout this significant period of growth has been a tremendous honor and accomplishment for me.\nSTERIS is on solid financial footing and has a proven financial team in place, which makes now the right time to transition the CFO position to Karen. Karen and I have worked together for the past 20 years at STERIS, and we have been working behind the scenes for many years preparing her for this role. I am confident in not only her financial ability, but also her leadership capability to lead this great company into the future.\nI will be around for a while as a special financial adviser and look forward to supporting a smooth transition. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about the start to fiscal 2026 and our updated outlook. Before we jump into the numbers, I do want to take a moment to recognize Mike for his long and successful career as CFO.\nMike's leadership and financial acumen have been essential to our success. Under his leadership as CFO, we have grown meaningfully in all aspects: revenue, earnings and market cap and have completed over 80 M&A transactions. He has built a strong global team, including Karen, and we are well prepared for this transition.\nMoving on to our performance. Mike covered the quarter at a high level, so I will add some commentary on our segments. Starting with Healthcare, constant currency organic revenue grew 8% for the first quarter with growth across all categories. Healthcare capital equipment revenue increased 6% for the quarter with underlying order growth of 14% and ending backlog just over $400 million.\nService continued its streak of outperformance, growing 13% in the first quarter, and Consumables grew 5% compared with a strong first quarter last year.\nEBIT Margins for Healthcare in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 24.2%, with volume, pricing, positive productivity and restructuring program benefits offsetting tariffs and inflation.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 10% for the quarter with 12% growth in Services. Services benefited from currency, bioprocessing demand and stable medical device volumes.\nEBIT margins for AST were 48.6%, up 150 basis points from the first quarter of last year as the additional volume and pricing were able to more than offset increases in energy and labor.\nConstant currency organic revenue increased 4% for the Life Sciences group in the quarter, driven once again by strong growth in Consumables of 8%. Services revenue grew 3%, capital equipment revenue was about flat, with backlog up over 50% to $111 million.\nMargins increased 260 basis points, benefiting from favorable mix, pricing and productivity.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we grew the bottom line 15% in the quarter to $2.34 per diluted share. Included in that number is approximately $9 million of tariff impact, which primarily impacted our Healthcare segment.\nTurning to our outlook for fiscal 2026. As noted in the press release, we are updating our outlook for as-reported revenue due to a significant shift in forward currency rates. We now anticipate approximately 8% to 9% revenue growth, which reflects about 200 basis points of favorable currency.\nConstant currency organic revenue growth is unchanged at 6% to 7%. Each segment is expected to grow constant currency organic revenue in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2026. AST's revenue and growth in the first quarter was stronger than anticipated. Despite the strong start, we are maintaining our outlook for the year at this time.\nOur earnings outlook is also unchanged at $9.90 to $10.15, which now reflects $45 million in tariff costs, an increase of $15 million over last quarter. Fortunately, favorable foreign currency will offset that increase.\nFor your modeling purposes, at the high end of our earnings range, we would expect EBIT margins to be about flat. No change is anticipated to our effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. Based on the strong start to the year, we are increasing our outlook for free cash flow by $50 million to $820 million for fiscal 2026. CapEx remains unchanged at $375 million.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so we can begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you. Thank you, Dan, for your comment. Helen, can you please give the instructions for Q&A, and we'll have started?"

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter [indiscernible] from continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, total as reported revenue grew 4%. Constant currency organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, driven by volume as well as 210 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 170 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.3%. Positive price, favorable mix and productivity outpaced labor inflation. EBIT margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8% of revenue compared with last year.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%, and the year-over-year increase was driven by unfavorable discrete item adjustments. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $270 million, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.74, a 14% increase over the prior year. We are pleased with our ability to grow earnings double digits all year with lower interest expense following the divestiture of the Dental segment.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2025 totaled $370 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $476 million. We continue to pay down debt during the quarter, ending with $2 billion in total debt. Gross debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.4x. Free cash flow for fiscal 2025 was a record $787 million, well above our full year guidance, driven by significant working capital improvements, in particular, inventory.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fiscal 2025 performance and our outlook for fiscal 2026. Mike covered the quarter, so I will touch on our performance for the full year and our outlook for fiscal 2026.\nFrom a total company perspective, we ended the year with 6% revenue growth and 12% earnings growth. The diversified nature of our business allowed us to deliver results in line with our original outlook despite a few obstacles during the year.\nLooking at our segments, Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 6% for the year. led by strong recurring revenue streams. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined 5% for the year against our record year last year. Capital equipment orders grew over 12% for the full year as underlying demand remained strong.\nMargins improved nicely in Healthcare, hitting the 25% mark for the year, with volume, pricing and positive productivity offsetting labor inflation. Towards the end of the year, we also began to benefit from the restructuring cost savings, capturing approximately $5 million in savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 9% for the year with 7% growth in services. Med device customers remained stable, while bioprocessing was a bit lumpy during the year. Capital equipment shipments more than doubled compared to the prior year and exceeded our expectations. EBIT margins for AST were 44.8%, down slightly year-over-year as we continue to face energy and labor headwinds and had a negative mix shift from capital equipment shipments.\nConstant currency organic revenue increased 1% for Life Sciences for the full year, driven once again by strong growth in consumables and services offset by a decline in capital equipment revenue. Margins increased to 42.3%, a 360 basis point improvement, benefiting from favorable mix, pricing and the divestiture of the CECS business.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we ended the year strong and exceeded our revised outlook with adjusted EPS of $9.22. The upside to our estimates was driven by lower corporate spending and improved profitability in both Healthcare and the Life Science segments.\nTurning to our outlook for fiscal 2026. As noted in the press release, we anticipate as reported revenue from continuing operations to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2026. We do not have any acquisition or divestiture impacts heading into the new fiscal year, and changes in foreign currency are expected to be neutral to STERIS. As a result, constant currency organic revenue growth is also expected to grow 6% to 7%. Included in this outlook is approximately 200 basis points of price.\nEach segment is expected to grow revenue in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2026. One minor note on AST revenue growth, our outlook reflects high single-digit growth in services revenue, which will be somewhat offset by a decline in capital equipment to get to the 6% to 7% growth total for the year.\nAs you saw in the press release, we have estimated the impact for tariffs for fiscal 2026, which are reflected in our outlook. We manufacture a significant number of products in North America for use in the U.S. with about 85% of the products sold in the U.S. coming from North American manufacturing. This significantly reduces our tariff exposure compared to many others, but we are not immune to the impact of tariffs. Our fiscal 2026 outlook of $9.90 to $10.15 includes $30 million of tariff costs. The EPS range implies 7% to 10% growth in earnings, including tariffs, which is impressive performance. I want to take a moment to thank our supply chain and commercial teams for all their efforts on this front.\nThe anticipated tariff impact is a net number. We do expect to leverage the strength of STERIS to mitigate some of our exposure. The $30 million estimate is based on global tariffs currently in effect, including the 10% global tariff and the recently announced 90-day trade deal with China. For your modeling purposes, at the high end of our earnings range, we would expect EBIT margins to increase approximately 20 basis points reflecting our ability to offset tariffs. The effective tax rate is planned at approximately 23.5%. As we enter into the new fiscal year, we are well positioned to deliver both top and bottom line growth in 2026.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so that we can begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we'll get started. ."

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance from continuing operations. For the third quarter, total revenue reported -- as reported grew 6% with constant currency organic revenue also growing 6% for the quarter, driven by volume as well as 240 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 90 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.6%. Positive price and productivity offset labor inflation. EBIT margin decreased 10 basis points to 23.3% of revenue compared with last year's third quarter.\nLitigation expense associated with our ethylene oxide trial, which began in December as well as increased health care benefit costs from higher utilization by employees of our health care benefits program accounted for over $10 million of additional expense year-over-year in the third quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. The year-over-year increase is attributable to unfavorable discrete items.\nNet income from continuing operations in the quarter was $229 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.32, an 11% increase over last year. We are pleased with our ability to grow earnings double digits all year with the help of lower interest expense following the divestiture of the Dental segment. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal 2025 totaled $299 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $354 million. Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year, mainly due to timing.\nWe continue to pay down debt during the quarter, ending with $2.2 billion in total debt. Total debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.5x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of fiscal 2025 was $588 million, well on track to achieve our full year guidance of approximately $700 million.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third quarter performance and our outlook for the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had another strong quarter. Looking at our segments. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter, led once again by strong recurring revenue streams. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains.\nHealthcare capital equipment revenue declined 5% in the quarter due primarily to the timing of shipments. Orders grew over 10% in the third quarter, which is reflected in the $435 million Healthcare backlog. While order growth remains robust, shipments were delayed by customer project delays. Margins improved nicely in Healthcare with volume, pricing and positive productivity offsetting labor inflation.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 10% with 10% growth in services and a small decline in capital equipment shipments. Supporting growth in services, global medtech customers were stable, and we saw growth in bioprocessing demand above our expectations. EBIT margins for AST were flat year-over-year and increased nicely sequentially. While the additional volume was helpful, we continue to be impacted by higher labor and energy costs.\nConstant currency organic revenue declined 1% for the Life Sciences Group in the quarter, driven once again by strong growth in consumables and services, offset by a decline in capital equipment revenue. As expected, the divestiture of the CECS business on April 1 impacted our as-reported revenue. Margins increased to 42.6%, a 390 basis point improvement, benefiting from favorable mix, pricing and the divestiture of CECS.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025. With 3 quarters under our belt, we are tightening our ranges for revenue and earnings. As mentioned in the press release, the biggest change since last quarter is the unfavorable impact of currency rate changes impacting both revenue and profit. In addition, we were shy of our revenue expectations in the third quarter for Healthcare capital equipment. As a result, our outlook for as-reported revenue from continuing operations is now approximately 6%.\nConstant currency organic revenue growth is also expected to be approximately 6%. Reflecting approximately $0.10 of impact from negative currency, adjusted earnings per diluted share are now expected to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.15. Our expectations for free cash flow are unchanged at about $700 million with approximately $360 million in capital spending.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to comment on the first ethylene oxide case to be tried against Isomedix, which ended in a mistrial last month. As you heard from Mike, we have incurred significant expenses defending Isomedix. But we believe that when the evidence of Isomedix' safety practices and the scientific data related to ethylene oxide exposure is fairly presented in trial, reasonable people will conclude that there is no connection between the unfortunate medical conditions of the claimants in Isomedix operations.\nWe believe the evidence presented during the 4 weeks of trial demonstrated that during the 44 months of Isomedix ownership, its conduct complied with applicable law and was reasonable, transparent and protective of our people, our neighbors and the environment. After the court granted the plaintiff's request for mistrial, we learned that the majority of the remaining jury supported a verdict in Isomedix' favor at the time that deliberations were terminated.\nThe court has scheduled this first trial for -- the first case for retrial in May of this year, and we will continue to vigorously defend Isomedix in these cases. We have continued to invest in these facilities. We have created processes and procedures that meet or exceed the applicable environmental and regulatory standards. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so we can begin the Q&A?\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chuck, can you please give the instructions for Q&A, and we'll get started."

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. Our discussions today will be focused on results from continuing operations. As you saw in the press release, we started the year strong with total revenue growth of 8% in the quarter. Constant currency organic revenue growth of 6% driven by volume as well as 270 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.1%. Positive price and favorable material costs were somewhat offset by inflation. EBIT margin decreased 20 basis points to 22.3% of revenue compared with the first quarter last year, increased compensation and higher insurance costs are impacting EBIT margins. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, lower than the prior year due to favorable discrete item adjustments.\nNet income in the quarter was $201.7 million and adjusted earnings per share was $2.03, a 10% increase over last year. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 totaled $108 million, and depreciation and amortization totaled $112.7 million. Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year, mainly due to timing. With the closing of the dental divestiture on May 31, we were able to pay down debt, reducing total debt to $2.3 billion. Total debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.6x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195.7 million. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of capital spending. Last week, we announced our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our quarterly dividend increased $0.05 per share from $0.52 to $0.57.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had a strong start to our new fiscal year. Looking at our segments, healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. It is our expectation that recurring revenue will continue to grow above procedure volumes and relatively independent of our capital equipment shipments. Over half of our consumables and service revenue is not related to our capital equipment.\nAs anticipated, our Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined in the quarter against challenging comparisons. However, we still anticipate low single-digit revenue growth for Healthcare capital equipment for the full fiscal year. We remain confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 8%, the best performance we have seen in over a year. Supporting that growth, Europe Medtech grew nicely in the quarter, and bioprocessing was about flat year-over-year globally. We are pleased to see these 2 factors playing out as planned and continue to anticipate a return to growth in bioprocessing revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Constant currency organic revenue growth for Life Sciences was 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in consumables. As expected, the divestiture of the CECS business on April 1 impacted our as-reported revenues.\nFor the full year, we are reiterating our outlook, including 6% to 7% constant currency organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $9.05 to $9.25. Our expectations for free cash flow also unchanged at about $700 million with approximately $360 million in capital spending. All in, we are pleased with the start of the fiscal year. Trends continue to head in a positive direction for all of our segments and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.\nThat concludes the prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so that we can begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Joe, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Winter of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call, we will have Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO, and I do have a few words of caution before we open for [Indiscernible].\nThis webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today.

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our performance.\nAs you saw in the press release, we finished the year strong with total revenue growth of 10% in the fourth quarter and constant currency organic revenue growth of 6%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $2.58. For the full year, we exceeded expectations with 12% total revenue growth and constant currency organic revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share totaled $8.83 exceeding our outlook.\nWith the announcement of the divestiture of the Dental segment, we are required to report results from continuing operations starting now. As a result, the rest of our comments today will be focused on results from continuing operations. Contained within the numerous press release tables, you will find an 8-quarter recast of results from continuing and discontinued operations to help with year-over-year comparisons.\nTurning to Continuing Operations. Fourth quarter constant currency organic revenue grew 7%, driven by volume as well as 240 basis points of price. This is impressive when compared to the strong fourth quarter last year. Once again, our Healthcare segment exceeded expectations. During the quarter, Healthcare shipped a record $332 million in capital equipment. Gross margin for the quarter declined 80 basis points with the prior -- compared to the prior year to 42.6%. Positive price and productivity were more than offset by negative segment mix and increased materials and labor costs. EBIT margin decreased 30 basis points to 23.7% of revenue compared with the fourth quarter last year. The operating income mix shift between Healthcare and AST once again impacted our margins. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%, lower than we anticipated due to several favorable discrete item adjustments. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $240.5 million and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.41.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2024 totaled $360 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $565 million. Total debt sits at $3.2 billion, and our total debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 2.1x gross leverage. Free cash flow for fiscal 2024 was $620 million as we benefited from higher generation from cash from operations, including less use of cash for working capital requirements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for making the time to join us today.\nMike already covered the fourth quarter, so I will focus on our fiscal 2024 segment performance in our outlook for fiscal 2025 for continuing operations.\nFiscal 2024 turned out to be a strong year for STERIS. As you've heard from us previously, Healthcare has consistently outperformed all year ending fiscal 2024 with 13% constant currency organic revenue growth, the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for this segment. The single biggest driver was the work done by our operations teams to reduce lead times, and as a result, return our backlog back-to-normal levels. I am pleased to report that as of the fourth quarter, our lead times are back to pre-pandemic levels for the first time in 2 years. As a result, Healthcare backlog is also now hovering around what we believe to be the new normal at just over $350 million.\nService and consumables each had strong organic revenue growth for the fiscal year as we continue to benefit from the breadth of our offering and the size and quality of our service teams. AST grew 3% constant currency organic for the year, which is unusually light, but ended up with improving service revenue growth, for example, in the fourth quarter, service revenue grew 7%, which is a mixture of double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and low single-digit revenue growth in EMEA. While it is early days, bioprocessing demand seems to have stabilized and did not unfavorably impact our performance in the quarter. This is a positive step forward. We do not expect to return to meaningful bioprocessing growth until the second half of fiscal 2025, aligned with the comments that you have been hearing from our public company customers.\nLife Sciences ended fiscal 2024 in line with our long-term expectations at 6% constant currency organic revenue growth. The path may have swerved a bit more than we're used to, but a solid year for the segment overall. In particular, double-digit revenue growth in service for the year is an impressive achievement as we continue to win new contracts and see improved parts sales. Considering some of the macro challenging facing the pharma sector, we are pleased with the Life Sciences segment results.\nTurning to our updated outlook. Fiscal '25 will be another strong year for STERIS. As reported revenue from continuing operations is expected to increase 6.5% to 7.5% for fiscal 2025. This includes the additional 4 months of the [ BD ] acquisition a full year impact from the divestiture of our controlled environmental services business within the Life Sciences segment and neutral foreign currency.\nConstant currency organic revenue growth from continuing operations is expected to be 6% to 7%. For your modeling, our expectation that the segment level for constant currency organic revenue growth is that AST grows high single digits for the year with growth accelerating in the second half. Healthcare is anticipated to grow mid-single digits and Life Sciences expected to grow low single digits. As a reminder, our first quarter of fiscal 2024 was particularly strong with high teens growth in health care. EBIT margins are expected to improve for the year as some headwinds from fiscal 2024 [indiscernible]. As a result, adjusted earnings per diluted share coming from continuing operations are anticipated to increase 10% to 13% at a range of $9.05 to $9.25. This outlook assumes that the divestiture of the Dental segment closes in the first quarter, and the proceeds are primarily used to repay variable rate debt. Our earnings split for revenue is anticipated to be 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half.\nBefore we conclude, I do want to make a few remarks on the strategic plan we have been executing during fiscal 2024. After significant review, we decided we needed to improve focus on our core customers in healthcare, pharma and med tech as well as areas where we can achieve sustainable and profitable growth. As a result, we made a decision to divest 2 businesses during the year, most notably the Dental segment.\nIn addition, today, we announced a targeted restructuring plan, which includes restructuring of the health care surgical capital business in Europe as well as other actions, including impairment of an internally developed high-capacity [ X-ray Accelerator ], product rationalizations and facility consolidations. Combined, these actions allow us to focus on our core business and deliver on the long-term commitments we have made to our investors. We are confident that with these changes, we have the right portfolio, sales channels and network of facilities to deliver to our customers over the years to come.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, will you please give the instructions so we can begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chuck, if you'll give the instructions, we can open for Q&A."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance.\nFor the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 10% driven by volume as well as 270 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 50 basis points compared with the prior year to 43.6%. Price more than offset continued material and labor inflation in addition to the negative impact from currency. EBIT margin decreased 80 basis points to 23.1% of revenue compared with the third quarter last year. The anticipated increase in our year-over-year incentive compensation expense, along with the mix shift in operating income from the AST segment to the Healthcare segment impacted EBIT margins. We anticipate that the mix shift in operating income from AST to Healthcare will continue in the fourth quarter.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.6%. Net income in the quarter was $220.9 million, and adjusted earnings were $2.22 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal '24 totaled $268.8 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $430.8 million. Debt declined slightly to $3.3 billion in the third quarter. Total debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 2.2x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of fiscal 2024 was $457 million compared with $262.8 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 increase was driven by higher earnings and declines in cash used for tax and compensation-related payments as well as a decline in capital expenditures. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us to hear more about our third quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.\nAs you heard from Mike, our third quarter continued the momentum we have experienced in our Healthcare segment in the past few quarters, and we also saw a nice improvement in Life Sciences. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. We continue to expect that our Healthcare segment will outperform our original expectations for the fiscal year, offsetting macro challenges impacting demand in our other segments.\nLooking at our segments. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 12% in the quarter. Supporting that performance, we had double-digit growth across capital equipment, consumables and service again this quarter. This is driven primarily by procedure volume rebound in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. As anticipated, backlog continues to normalize as we are shipping at a faster pace than new orders are coming in. Remember, our goal is to get back to historic production lead times and continue to meet customer demand.\nSpeaking of demand, capital equipment orders in the Healthcare segment grew double digits in the quarter.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 4%, which was below our expectations. While we have continued to see more normalized volumes in the U.S. for medtech, outside of the U.S. remains softer than anticipated. In addition, bioprocessing volumes continue to contract. Until we have more clarity, we are taking a more conservative approach to our expectations for the fourth quarter.\nLife Sciences grew 20% in the quarter on a constant currency organic basis. We had another strong quarter of capital shipments which grew 57% against relatively easy comparisons. Remember, in fiscal 2023, revenue for both capital equipment and consumables was shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter due to some supply chain constraints. Consumables grew 8% and service revenue increased 12%.\nAs you're hearing from others in the space, short-term demand remains a bit murky and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for this segment.\nOur Dental segment third quarter revenue declined 6% on a constant currency organic basis. Revenue is limited by reduced orders from a large customer due to a temporary disruption of their operations as a result of a cybersecurity incident they experienced during the quarter. Excluding that disruption, revenue would have been about flat in the quarter which reflects the decline in patient volumes. The lower volume, combined with the continued increases in material costs led to a decline in EBIT margin for the quarter.\nTurning to our outlook. Fiscal 2024 is shaping up to be another strong year for STERIS, albeit not exactly the way we had anticipated. In the last few years, if they've taught us anything, it's the value of our diversified portfolio. Time and time again, we have benefited as one of our segments outperforms to compensate for challenges elsewhere. We are updating our outlook for the year to increase revenue to reflect the continued outperformance of our Healthcare segment.\nFor the year, we now expect total revenue to grow 10% to 11% on a constant currency organic basis -- I'm sorry, and constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, each up 100 basis points from our prior ranges. This assumes low single-digit constant currency organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter caused by the record-setting shipments in last year's fourth quarter. EBIT margins for the fiscal year will decline slightly from fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting the shift in operating income mix from AST to Healthcare. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are now anticipated to be in the range of $8.60 to $8.70 for fiscal 2024. We recognize this outlook includes some conservatism but believe it is warranted until we see the AST customer destocking abate and have additional clarity on bioprocessing volumes.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions, and we can begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments.

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 8% driven by volume as well as 330 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.3%. The favorable price was more than offset by lower productivity and continued material and labor inflation.\nEBIT margin decreased 130 basis points to 22.5% of revenue, compared with the second quarter last year, which reflects the decline in gross margin as well as the anticipated increase in year-over-year incentive compensation expense. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7%. Net income in the quarter was $202.2 million and adjusted earnings were $2.03 per diluted share.\nCapital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2024 totaled $149.9 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled [ $200.2 ] million. We are adjusting our capital spending outlook for fiscal 2024, down from [ $375 ] million to $310 million. This change reflects the timing of projects for our AST business. The change will allow us to offset higher-than-planned inventory levels, keeping free cash flow outlook for fiscal 2024 at approximately $685 million.\nDebt increased to $3.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting borrowings to fund the acquisition of the BD assets. Total debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 2.3x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2024 was $284.7 million as we benefited from lower capital spending and a decline in cash used for tax and compensation related payments. Inventory remains elevated as we continue to focus on reducing lead times and meeting customer demand.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for making the time to join us to hear more about our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, our quarter continued the momentum we have experienced in our Healthcare segment for the past few quarters. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the Healthcare segment and is anticipated to outperform our original expectations for the fiscal year, offsetting the macro challenges impacting demand in our other segments.\nLooking at our segments. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 14% in the quarter. We experienced double-digit growth across capital equipment, consumables and service again this quarter. This is driven primarily by procedure volume rebound in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains.\nAs anticipated, our backlog has reduced as we were able to ship faster pace than new orders are coming in as we get back to normal lead times for our customers. During the first half, we saw strength in replacement orders, representing 65% of our total orders in healthcare. We are increasingly confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment. Growth will, however, decelerate in the second half as we face very challenging comparisons in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to AST, constant currency organic revenue declined 1%, while our services business grew 5%, our capital equipment business declined due to the timing of large shipments. In addition, our performance in the quarter continued to be impacted by 2 short-term situations. Inventory destocking in the med tech space and the year-over-year market decline of the bioprocessing customer demand.\nWe do see very positive signs of recovery in the med tech demand. We saw good growth in the U.S. during the quarter, reflecting the improving procedure environment and the burn down of customer inventory. We continue to see weakness, however, in the European markets where procedure recovery is taking a bit longer to take hold. From a bioprocessing perspective, as we have said, FY '24 represents a bit of a reset, and we do not anticipate returning to year-over-year growth in bioprocessing in fiscal 2024.\nAs we head into the second half, our comps ease as it was the third quarter of fiscal 2023 when we first witnessed declines in bioprocessing. Based on these factors, our outlook continues to reflect very strong growth in the second half of the fiscal year for our AST segment as compared to the first half.\nLife Sciences revenue grew 5% in the quarter on a constant currency organic basis as the delayed capital shipments from the first quarter were recognized contributing to 18% growth in capital equipment. Consumables grew 4% and service was flat. As you are hearing from many other spaces, the short-term demand remains a bit murky. We continue, however, to be very optimistic about the long-term trends driving demand for aseptic manufacturing in biopharma.\nOur Dental segment, second quarter revenue declined 6% on a constant currency organic basis as revenue was limited by customer destocking of inventory, in particular, for infection control products. Despite these challenges, we are impressed with the ability of the business to sequentially improve margins, delivering EBIT margins above total company in the quarter.\nAll in, we are pleased with the first half of the fiscal year. U.S. procedure trends continue to shift in a positive direction. Supply chain challenges have largely abated and our ability to execute and ship capital products to our delivery times has greatly improved. That said, there are still pockets of uncertainty, which remain outside of our Healthcare segment.\nWe are maintaining our expectations of 6% to 7% constant currency organic revenue growth for fiscal 2024 as we expect a strong third quarter followed by a very tough fourth quarter comparisons, which will limit our total growth in the second half. In addition, from an earnings perspective, we now have an additional headwind from of about $0.05, which we are absorbing in our current outlook of $8.60 to $8.80.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions and we can start the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started. ."

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 11%, driven by volume as well as 290 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 30 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.8%. Favorable price was more than offset by continued material and labor inflation as well as lower productivity. EBIT margin decreased 50 basis points to 22.4% of revenue compared with the first quarter last year, which reflects a decline in gross margin as well as the anticipated increase in year-over-year incentive compensation, which is recorded in Corporate and Other.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.6%. Net income in the quarter was $198.2 million, and adjusted earnings were $2 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $66.6 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $137.9 million. Debt declined slightly in the first quarter and totaled just over $2.9 billion. Total debt to EBITDA was approximately 2.1x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $214.5 million as we were able to collect on our strong fourth quarter revenue. Inventory remains elevated as we continue to focus on reducing lead times and meeting customer demand.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for making time to join us to hear more about our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had a strong start to our new fiscal year exceeding our plans and the STERIS' expectations. Looking at our segments, Healthcare, constant currency organic revenue grew 18% in the quarter. We experienced double-digit growth across capital equipment, consumables and service. This is driven primarily by procedure volumes in the U.S. continuing to rebound as well as price and market share gains. In addition, the improving supply chain environment, coupled with our ability to reduce lead times, led to a very strong quarter of capital equipment shipments.\nHospital capital spending remains robust as evidenced by our healthcare backlog, which totals almost $500 million at the end of the quarter despite the strong shipments. Large projects continue to drive orders representing 40% of first quarter orders. We are increasingly confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment.\nTurning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 5%. Our performance in the quarter was impacted by 2 temporary situations, inventory destocking in some categories of med tech and the year-over-year market decline of bioprocessing customer demand. As we said last quarter, FY '24 represents a bit of a reset and we do not anticipate returning to year-over-year growth in -- in fiscal 2024. As for the med tech inventory destocking, we would not expect that to continue beyond the first half of the year, and we anticipate customer inventories at that time will align with the procedural growth we are all experiencing. As a result, our expectations are for stronger growth in the second half of the year for AST.\nLife Sciences revenue declined slightly in the quarter due to the timing of capital shipments which more than offset the growth in service and consumables. Underlying demand for the business remains strong as evidenced by our near-record backlog. Our full year expectations for the Life Sciences segment continue to be mid-single-digit revenue growth despite the lumpy first quarter start.\nOur Dental segment first quarter revenue declined 4% on a constant currency organic basis as revenue was limited by customer destocking of inventory, in particular, for infection control products. However, we did see patient volumes improve for the first time post-COVID. We are confident that we will achieve low single-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year in Dental.\nAll in, we are pleased with the start to the year. Trends continue to shift in a positive direction and our ability to execute and ship products has greatly improved. There are still pockets of uncertainty, whether that be supply chain, procedure volumes or inventory management.\nAs mentioned in our press release, we believe that the acquisition of the surgical instrumentation assets from Becton, Dickinson will close much earlier than we originally anticipated. As a result, we have updated our outlook for as reported revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We are feeling increasingly optimistic about our constant currency organic performance for the year, yet we are still holding our outlook to 6% to 7% growth. We acknowledge that this is a somewhat conservative approach given our start to the year.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Julie, would you please give the instructions, and we can begin Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chuck, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started. ."

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. Following my review, Dan will comment on the full year fiscal '23 and talk about our outlook for fiscal '24. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 16% driven by volume as well as 330 basis points of price. As anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 240 basis points compared with the prior year to 43.1% as pricing and currency were more than offset by unfavorable mix and approximately $15 million in excess material and labor inflation. We incurred approximately $90 million in higher material and labor costs during fiscal 2023.\nWe achieved approximately $10 million of cost synergies from the integration of Cantel Medical in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to just over $55 million. We are proud of the work our folks did to integrate Cantel Medical into STERIS, overachieving our projected total cost synergies ahead of schedule. We have substantially completed the integration process and going forward, we will no longer be tracking and reporting cost synergies from Cantel. EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 23.8% of revenue compared with the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue, somewhat offset by the gross margin pressures I mentioned earlier. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, net income in the quarter was $229.2 million, and earnings were $2.30 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 exceeded our plan and totaled $362 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $553 million.\nOur capital expenditures spending was higher than anticipated primarily driven by the timing of investments in our AST segment. Total debt remains just over $3 billion, reflecting borrowings to fund a few small acquisitions during the year and opportunistic share repurchases. We remained active buying back stock in the fourth quarter and in total, repurchased 1.6 million shares in fiscal 2023 for a total spend of $295 million.\nAs we anticipated last week or as announced last week, our Board has authorized a new repurchase program for up to $500 million in buybacks. For fiscal 2024, we would anticipate returning to our normal cadence of repurchasing shares only to offset dilution. Total debt to EBITDA at the end of the fiscal year is just under 2.3x gross leverage. Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 was $410 million. Free cash flow was limited by higher-than-planned capital spending and pressure on working capital, in particular, for inventory and receivables.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nSenior VP & COO, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter and full year call. I will cover a few of the highlights of the year and then address our outlook for fiscal 2024. As you heard from Mike, we ended the year strong and grew revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis in fiscal 2023. This is impressive performance, in particular, given the macro challenges we faced all year. We are cautiously optimistic that supply chain challenges have eased in a meaningful way and surgical procedure rates are improving. Our fourth quarter and full year results are reflective of that.\nAt the business level, our Healthcare segment revenue ramped up throughout the year, culminating an 11% constant currency organic growth for the year with very strong performance in the fourth quarter. Healthcare capital equipment grew 15% for the year on top of double-digit growth last year. The team did a great job working through the [ WIP ] inventory and shipped $50 million more capital equipment in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. Having the components we needed to get those products out to our customers was essential, and it was a huge lift by our supply chain and manufacturing teams. While we still have pockets that are challenging, we are feeling much better about the availability and access to components for our capital equipment heading into fiscal 2024.\nIn addition, our backlog continues to hover around $500 million despite the strong shipments during the quarter. $500 million is a very solid place to start the new fiscal year. Of note, our orders have shifted again towards large projects, which represented 50% of the capital equipment orders in the fourth quarter. Remember that large project orders tend to have longer lead times. Healthcare consumables also finished the year strong as we saw restocking of products as surgical procedures continue to increase sequentially. For the year, consumables revenue grew 5%, about in line with our long-term expectations, although revenue was a bit lumpier from a quarter-to-quarter perspective than we would normally anticipate. Our Healthcare Service revenue finished strong growing 8% for the year with solid growth across all the business aspects. Our AST segment grew 12% on a constant currency organic basis for the year despite a reduction in demand for single-use bioprocessing disposables. As Healthcare procedures continue to rebound, the underlying demand for our products from core customers in med tech remain very strong.\nAs mentioned last quarter, about 10% of the AST business is comprised of bioprocessing customers, which slowed for the first time during our third quarter. That trend continued into the fourth quarter, where once again, we saw a decline in revenue of about $5 million. We believe the trough will come in the first half of our new fiscal year, and while we would expect to return to sequential growth in the second half, we do not expect to return to year-over-year growth until fiscal 2025. Our customers in that space have made significant investments to expand their manufacturing capacity for the long-term growth. And we have every belief that, that growth will return once we work through the short-term destocking.\nTurning to Life Sciences. Constant currency organic revenue grew 5% for the year with a strong finish in the fourth quarter despite the reduction in bioprocessing and vaccine demand. As anticipated, the 10 million in capital equipment that we couldn't ship in the third quarter came through in the fore, contributing to a record quarter of capital shipments. Consumables also finished strong as we work through supply chain challenges, including more normalized shipping to Asia Pacific, and we were able to make progress towards more normal delivery times. Service grew mid-single digits for the year with solid performance in equipment maintenance and installation of new capital equipment. Backlog is holding just over $100 million and that is a great place to start the new fiscal year. Dental was about flat on a constant currency organic basis for the year. Procedure volumes remain at approximately 95% of pre-COVID levels due to the broader economic pressures impacting consumer spending. Based on market data, STERIS is performing better than market and benefiting from pricing and modest share gains.\nTurning back to the P&L. Even with favorable pricing, gross margins were down 180 basis points for the year as our cost increased at a rate faster than we could recoup. We did a nice job managing SG&A in the year and improved EBIT margin by 10 basis points in the face of the gross margin declines. Unfortunately, part of that was due to lower incentive compensation for our people, which we'll be working hard to get back in fiscal 2024. Interest and taxes were a bit of a headwind to bottom line growth, but we finished fiscal 2023 at $8.20 in adjusted earnings per diluted share an increase of 4% from fiscal 2022.\nWhile that is certainly lower than our standard earnings performance, our 5-year CAGR for adjusted EPS is still an impressive 15%. As I said in the beginning of the call, we feel optimistic heading into fiscal 2024. Our strong fourth quarter allowed us to level out our performance between fiscal years more than anticipated. We also saw nice signs of improvement, which began in the third quarter and continued to improve sequentially, leaving us optimistic that we have a few tailwinds in fiscal 2024. In particular, we anticipate continued recovery of health care procedures and easing of supply chain issues as well as foreign currency leveling out.\nFor fiscal 2024, total revenue is anticipated to grow 7% to 8%, with about 100 basis points in positive foreign currency impact. Constant currency organic revenue is expected to grow 6% to 7%. That includes about 200 basis points in favorable pricing. Gross margins are expected to improve modestly as some of the headwinds faced in fiscal 2023 abate. EBIT margins are anticipated to be about flat as we absorb approximately $40 million from incentive compensation year-over-year and cost increases above and beyond normal inflation for material and labor of about $30 million. Interest and taxes will be a bit of a headwind, some of which will be offset by a reduced share count, reflecting the additional purchases made during fiscal 2023.\nFactoring in all of those moving pieces, our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2024 is $8.55 to $8.75. To assist you in your modeling, we do anticipate that our revenue and earnings will be weighted towards the second year -- second half of the year. In the first half, we anticipate continued impact from a reduction in bioprocessing demand resulting in difficult comparisons within AST that will impact our growth and profitability.\nFor both revenue and EPS, we would expect the split to be 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. As we look at our health care capital equipment, backlog remains strong, and we believe in fiscal 2024, we will return to a normal cadence of shipments, which generally start lighter in the first quarter and then build throughout the year. Our plan assumes we get back to normal lead times by the end of the fiscal year. And while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I would note that the anticipated cadence of capital equipment revenue combined with the significantly higher interest expense and tough comparisons in AST with bioprocessing will limit our Q1 earnings growth potential.\nThat said, the tide is turning. We are feeling good about the direction where we are heading and the outlook we have provided for fiscal 2024. As we have said before, our continued long-term goal is to grow revenue mid- to high single digits and leverage that growth to deliver double-digit growth in earnings. We strive to achieve this while also generating solid free cash flow, continuing to reduce our debt levels and grow our dividend.\nBefore we open for Q&A, I do want to make a few comments on the draft rules issued by the EPA last month. As you all know, over the past few years, we have made significant investments consistent with our practice of continuous improvement within our facilities. Our sustainable EO program and total permanent enclosure investments position us very well to comply with many of the draft requirements. We believe the EPA understands the weight of this regulation and its impact on the security of the vital U.S. sterile device supply chain, and we are confident there will be a reasonable outcome for the final rules. Behind the scenes, we are partnering with our industry association in terms of our response to the agency. Thank you.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to open it up for Q&A. Julie?\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThanks Mike and Dan for your comments, Chad, if you could give the instructions for Q&A, we'll get started."

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance.\nFor the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 7% driven by volume as well as 300 basis points of price. As anticipated, the divestiture of the renal care business impacted our revenue comparisons to the prior year by about $47 million which is detailed in the press release tables. This is the last quarter of a year-over-year impact for the renal care business as we divested it in January of last year.\nThe integration of Cantel Medical continues to go well. We achieved approximately $10 million of cost synergies in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to about $45 million. We are well on track to achieve our stated goal of approximately $50 million in fiscal year 2023.\nAs anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 200 basis points compared with the prior year to 43.1% as pricing, currency and the favorable impact from the divestiture of renal care were more than offset by lower productivity, unfavorable mix and higher material and labor costs.\nSequentially, the impact of material and labor costs have improved and totaled about $15 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. This puts us at about $75 million year-to-date with our outlook of $90 million for the year remaining unchanged. EBIT margin declined 10 basis points to 23.9% of revenue compared with the third quarter last year which reflects the gross margin pressures mentioned earlier, which were partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.4% higher than the prior year due primarily to geographic mix and favorable discrete items which occurred in last year's third quarter. Net income in the quarter was $202.4 million and earnings were $2.02 per diluted share, reflecting the lower anticipated volume.\nCapital expenditures for the first 9 months totaled $290.5 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $410.7 million. Year-to-date, our capital expenditure spending has been higher than anticipated primarily due to timing of our investments within the AST segment. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million.\nTotal debt increased slightly in the third quarter to just over $3 billion, reflecting borrowings to fund a few small acquisitions and share repurchases. Total debt-to-EBITDA is slightly over 2.3x gross leverage.\nFree cash flow in the first 9 months of the year was $263 million. Free cash flow was limited by higher-than-planned capital spending mainly due to timing and higher levels of inventory. With continued pressure on working capital, in particular, inventory and now accounts receivables, we now anticipate the free cash flow for the full year will be about $500 million or a reduction of about $100 million based on our last guidance.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter call. I will cover a few highlights from the quarter and then address our revised outlook for the fiscal year.\nStarting with health care. The segment grew 10% on a constant currency organic basis in the quarter. This was driven by high-teens growth in capital equipment, in particular, improved shipments in our IPT business were driven by operational and supply chain improvements in core washing and steam products. In addition, we saw double-digit revenue growth in our surgical products. Our main supply chain issue continues to be with electronic components. We are working hard to resolve these issues. And as we have discussed, we are working with existing and new suppliers where possible to ensure the availability of parts in order to meet customer demand.\nThe Healthcare Services business delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth, driven by increased demand and improved pricing. We also saw a sequential improvement in consumables. Consumables constant currency organic revenue grew low single digits compared with third quarter of last year. Supporting that growth, U.S. procedure volumes improved in the quarter, with recovery outside the U.S. still lagging.\nThe underlying dynamics of our Healthcare segment remains very favorable. Hospital capital spending remained stable as evidenced by our healthcare backlog, which totaled over $500 million at the end of the quarter. Orders for the quarter remain at approximately a 60-40 split for replacement in large projects, and we are not seeing any order cancellations at this time.\nAlthough we still have some delays, our capital shipments have improved dramatically from prior quarters. Approximately $30 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed into the fourth quarter. Overall, our third quarter healthcare performance showed nice improvement. Opportunities remain from a supply chain perspective, which we anticipate will take some time to fully work through. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect a conservative outlook on how quickly we can recover from these challenges and difficult comparisons in AST and Life Sciences.\nOur AST segment grew 7% on a constant currency organic basis. Despite a reduction in demand for bioprocessing disposables and delayed shipments from Mevex, our capital equipment business. On the bioprocessing side, our second quarter this year was a peak level for biopharma within AST. We are hearing from customers that they are resetting their expectations due to reduction in vaccine production.\nImportantly, we are not seeing declines in total revenue at this time, but rather a flattening of growth. Positively, we anticipate that our core medical device customers will benefit from improvement in procedures which we expect will help AST continue to perform at historic levels. Regarding Mevex, a large eBeam capital equipment order of approximately $10 million was delayed into Q4 as our customer was not ready to receive the unit.\nTurning to Life Sciences, constant currency organic revenue was down about 1% for the quarter with declines in capital equipment and consumables somewhat offset by growth in service. The same factors impacting the bioprocessing demand in AST are also impacting our Life Sciences consumables volume.\nIn addition, we have difficult comparison with strong consumables growth in the third quarter of last year. That said, we do anticipate that this is a matter of timing as cell and gene therapies continue to increase in demand, which should help offset the reduction in vaccine production. We remain confident in the long-term growth drivers within the customer base for both AST and the Life Science segments.\nIn addition, Life Sciences had an unanticipated shipping challenge out of Europe that limited capital equipment growth in the quarter by about $10 million. Positively, backlog remains at near historic levels at over $100 million.\nDental increased 1% on a constant currency organic revenue basis in the quarter. Procedure volumes remain at approximately 95% of pre-COVID levels due to the broader economic pressures impacting consumer spending. Based on market data, STERIS is performing better than market and benefiting from pricing and modest share gains.\nAs you heard from Mike, gross margins remain under pressure as anticipated. Despite the impact of lower gross margins and increased pressure from foreign currency, we held EBIT margins about flat in the quarter as SG&A was lower than planned, largely driven by lower incentive compensation. With added pressure on interest rates and taxes, our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter came in at $2.02.\nAs a result of our performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are revising our full year guidance. As reported revenue is now anticipated to grow 6% compared with prior expectations of 8% growth. Based on foreign currency forward rates through March 31, 2023, currency is now anticipated to negatively impact revenue by approximately $110 million this fiscal year, a decline from expectations of approximately $150 million.\nConstant currency organic revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 7% compared with prior expectations of 10%. With 1 quarter left, this revision and outlook implies the challenges which limit our performance in the third quarter do continue. Reflecting on the lower revenue, adjusted earnings per diluted share are now anticipated to be in the range of $8 to $8.10.\nOur long-term expectations for the business remain unchanged. We continue to be very strongly confident and believe that STERIS is capable in generating mid- to high single-digit constant currency organic revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth into the future.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Dan and Mike, for your comments. Jamie, if you'll give the instructions, we can open up for Q&A."

As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the express written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in our securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in yesterday's release, also including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intended providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision making.\nWith those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance.\nFor the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 7%, driven by volume as well as 290 basis points of price. As anticipated, the divestiture of the renal care business impacted our comparisons to the prior year by about $45 million, as detailed in the press release tables. Our year-over-year growth rates will be impacted by this divestiture for one more quarter.\nThe integration of Cantel Medical continues to go well. We achieved approximately $15 million of cost synergies in the second quarter, bringing our first half total to about $35 million. We are on track to achieve our stated goal of approximately $50 million in fiscal year 2023.\nAs anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.8% as pricing, currency and the favorable impact from the divestiture of Renal Care were more than offset by lower productivity and higher material and labor costs. Material, labor costs continue to be a headwind and totaled about $30 million in the quarter.\nDespite the decline in gross margin, EBIT increased 50 basis points to 23.8% of revenue compared with the second quarter of last year, which reflects the benefit of realized cost synergies from the Cantel integration, currency impact and lower-than-anticipated SG&A expenses driven by disciplined cost management and reduced incentive compensation. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8%.\nNet income in the quarter increased to $200 million and earnings were $1.99 per diluted share. You will notice that we reported a loss on a GAAP basis in the quarter.\nAt the time of the Cantel acquisition, we determined the fair value of the Dental segment based on projected cash flows discounted at rates reflecting market costs of capital and market EBITDA multiples. Macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflationary pressures on material labor costs and uncertainty regarding the impact of such economic strains may have on patient and customer behavior in the short term triggered an interim assessment of goodwill in the quarter.\nRevised cash flow projections and a current market weighted average cost of capital resulted in an estimated fair value of the Dental segment below its carrying value. Therefore, we recorded a $490.6 million noncash impairment charge related to the goodwill associated with the Dental segment. Our long-term outlook for the Dental segment is unchanged. And we continue to see significant growth opportunities in the dental space for STERIS.\nCapital expenditures in the first half of the fiscal year totaled $198.7 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $272.7 million. Year-to-date, our capital expenditures have been higher than anticipated, primarily driven by the timing of investments in the AST segment. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million.\nFree cash flow for the first half of the year was $138.2 million. Free cash flow was limited by higher-than-planned capital spending, mainly due to timing and higher-than-planned levels of inventory. We do not anticipate the same level of spend in the second half of the fiscal year for either which will contribute to a significant step up in free cash flow. All in, we now anticipate that free cash flow for the full year will be about $600 million or a reduction of $75 million from our original guidance.\nI will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us to hear more about our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our products and services. And as you've heard from Mike, we had a solid quarter despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. I will review the highlights of the quarter and then shift my commentary to our outlook.\nTotal company constant currency organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. Once again, foreign currency was more impactful than previously planned on our as-reported revenue, but we are pleased with our operational performance.\nFrom a segment perspective, Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, by August, we had an improved visibility on supply chain challenges and that we anticipated that we would start to see better component deliveries in the quarter. We received several key components, and we're able to step up our shipments in September. We continue to expect to see significant levels of capital shipments in the second half based on our backlog, the inventory of key components that we have or will continue to receive. Reflecting that scenario, capital equipment and service growth remained solid in the quarter as we continue to see good demand from our customers.\nConsumables were about flat on a constant currency organic basis. Our consumable growth is limited due to a lack of procedure growth on a year-over-year basis. As we have said before, we do not expect a significant pickup in procedures in the coming months, but we are optimistic we will get back to 100% prepandemic levels over time.\nHospital capital spending remains robust as evidenced by our Healthcare backlog, which totaled over $500 million at the end of the quarter. Orders for the quarter were approximately 60% for replacement products and 40% for large projects. Despite the uptick in shipments at the end of the quarter, we believe approximately $60 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed in our second quarter, further strengthening our confidence in the second half.\nLonger term, our portfolio at STERIS is essential to surgeries, either directly in the operating room or in the core support sterile processing department and we believe this provides us some insulation to our revenue base from our customers' rising cost of capital.\nMoving on to AST. AST grew constant currency organic revenue 19% in the second quarter as we continue to benefit from underlying demand from our core customers. In the second quarter, Mevex improved significantly on both a year-over-year basis and sequentially, which pushed our growth rate into the high teens. As you have already witnessed, shipments can be lumpy with this segment of the business. Similar to Life Sciences, these are large pieces of capital equipment that are not booked as revenue until they are fully installed and tested.\nFrom a profit perspective, increased energy costs, both in the U.S. and internationally, are impacting margins for AST. All signs indicate this will continue at least through the winter. We continue to look for ways to recoup these costs as the contracts allow in the timing of our increases.\nLife Sciences revenue was flat on a constant currency organic basis compared with the prior year. Solid service revenue growth was offset by declines in both capital and consumables. We believe capital equipment shipments are just a matter of timing as about $10 million slipped into the third quarter versus our expectations. And as a reminder, the business had a very strong shipment quarter in Q1. Also, our backlog continues to hover around $100 million. We are optimistic about the long-term demand for our capital equipment in this segment.\nOn the consumables side, we're about flat from a constant currency organic revenue perspective. This is primarily due to inventory management by our customers, in particular, in our barrier products line. Again, not concerned about the long-term underlying trends for the business as aseptic pharma production demand remains very strong.\nOur Dental segment declined 3% on a constant currency organic revenue perspective. While procedure volumes for Dental continue to hover around 95% of pre-COVID levels, year-over-year procedures have declined in the low single-digit range. We believe this is due to the current macroeconomic conditions. Despite the decline in revenue, operating margins were over 25% as we manage spending and experienced some relief on our supply chain costs.\nTurning to our full year outlook. Constant currency organic revenue growth expectations of 10% remain unchanged. However, based on the ongoing foreign currency challenges, we are revising our as-reported revenue. As-reported revenue is now expected to grow 8%, a reduction of 1% from the prior expectations due to continued foreign currency fluctuations. For the year, currency is now expected to reduce as-reported revenue by $150 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.15. The primary drivers of this continue to be the weak euro and British pound.\nReflected in our revenue outlook is improved pricing. We are now expecting around 250 basis points for the year. Combined pricing and disciplined spending will contribute to higher-than-planned operating margins for the fiscal year. This will help offset the impacts from foreign currency and additional supply chain inflation. For the year, we now expect an incremental $90 million in extraordinary supply chain and labor cost inflation, an increase of $20 million over our prior expectations.\nFactoring in these elements, our expectations for earnings are unchanged at the $8.40 to $8.60 range for the full fiscal year. However, with an additional 5% impact from foreign currency, we believe the high end of that range is less likely.\nOverall, our business continues to perform very well in this environment. Our teams and portfolios continue to come together to better meet the needs of our customers and the breadth of our offering allows us to take advantage of several significant trends in the industry by leveraging our relationships to cross-sell within business segments and deliver value to our customers.\nBefore we open for Q&A, I did want to address the challenges the industry is facing on ethylene oxide. As you all know, ethylene oxide is essential to the supply of sterile single-use medical devices throughout the world. To date, the industry does not have an alternative to EO. And currently, in the U.S., there is very limited capacity to manage the long-term growth expectations for the medical products industry's demand for ethylene oxide processing technology.\nAt STERIS, we take our responsibility very seriously as a provider of these crucial services and have always been committed to strict regulatory compliance and quality standards for the safety of our people, our facilities and the communities in which we operate. We are stewards of the long-term success of our business, which I believe is exemplified by our actions. We have regularly updated our processes and equipment used within our facilities to reflect the adoption of new technology and deploy the best practices possible.\nIn addition, we have led the industry in developing sustainable EO cycles, which significantly reduced the amount of EO gas used per cycle. And we have worked closely with the U.S. FDA to ease the regulatory transition for our customers so they can more easily adopt these cycles. This diligence is consistent with the way we have operated our contract sterilization business for many years. I am confident in how we have run and continue to run these facilities and the improvements we have made to our process within the AST segment.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Julie to begin the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, can you give the instructions, and we'll get started on Q&A."

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is, once again, my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.\nFor the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 6%. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 240 basis points of price. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately $151 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables.\nAs a reminder, the Renal divestiture will trim revenue by approximately $45 million per quarter through December. During the quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Cantel Medical. Integration continues to go very well.\nWe achieved approximately $20 million of cost synergies in the first quarter and are on track to achieve a total of approximately $50 million in fiscal year 2023. As anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 150 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.1% as pricing and favorable impact from acquisitions and divestitures and were offset by lower productivity and higher material and labor costs.\nMaterial labor costs continue to be a headwind and totaled about $30 million in the quarter. Despite the decline in gross margin, operating margin held flat at 22.9% of revenue compared with the first quarter of last year as we did a nice job of controlling SG&A expenses.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%. Net income in the quarter increased to $191.1 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.90. At the end of the first quarter, cash totaled approximately $316.3 million.\nWe continue to focus on debt repayment as evidenced by our leverage ratio now being just below 2.3x. Our focus on debt reduction continues to provide us great flexibility to make investments in growth capital expenditures and the capacity to pursue potential opportunities to expand our businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $115.9 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $138.9 million in the quarter.\nOur first quarter spend on capital expenditures was higher than anticipated primarily driven by the timing of investments within our AST segment. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter was $117.1 million as we benefited from increased net income, including a reduction in costs associated with the Cantel Medical acquisition, somewhat offset by higher capital expenditure spending.\nAnd finally, last week, we announced our 17th annual dividend increase, which raised our dividend by $0.04 to $0.47 per quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us to hear more about our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year. As you heard from Mike, we had a solid start to our new fiscal year and continue to experience strong demand for our products and services.\nI will review the highlights of the quarter and then shift my commentary to our revised outlook. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. Strong capital equipment and service growth was offset by an organic decline in consumables, which is largely attributable to the timing of orders against very strong comparisons in the prior year.\nHospital capital spending remains very robust as evidenced by our health care backlog which totaled over $500 million at the end of the quarter, and our orders for the quarter were 40% large project related.\nAST grew constant currency organic revenue 10% in the first quarter as we continued to benefit from underlying demand from our core customers. Growth was somewhat limited by the timing of large capital shipments from our Mevex business unit, which can often be lumpy.\nLife Sciences also delivered 10% constant currency organic revenue growth in the quarter with strong capital equipment shipments and solid mid-single-digit growth in our consumables business.\nOur Dental segment grew low single digits constant currency year-over-year for the quarter as revenue was limited by supply chain challenges.\nTurning to our revised outlook. From a macro perspective, we have several things impacting our business. As you have heard from many of our peers, currency has moved significantly and the forward rates continue to indicate headwinds on for STERIS in both revenue and profit for the remainder of the fiscal year. In addition, the supply chain environment has been limiting our ability to ship capital equipment. We believe approximately $35 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed in the first quarter.\nWhile procedure volumes continue to recover, particularly in the U.S., we are not seeing recovery as quickly as anticipated. The key variable for that recovery appears to be staffing availability at hospitals, which seems to be limiting their ability to catch up with pent-up demand for procedures.\nReflecting these challenges, we are adjusting our revenue outlook for the year. As reported, revenue is now expected to grow 9% and constant currency organic revenue is anticipated to be 10%. As you recall, we grew 13% last year. So double-digit constant currency organic growth on top of that is a significant goal, but one we believe is achievable due to the momentum in our business and strong capital equipment backlog.\nWhile we are not overly optimistic on supply chain improvements, we do see pockets of improvement there. The real key for us will be relief on parts in particular, electronic components. In many cases, components are needed to convert our significant work in progress inventory to finish goods so that they can be shipped to customers.\nAs a result of anticipated easing and supply chain constraints, we expect revenue growth rates to increase at a faster pace in the second half of the year as compared to the first half. Factoring in these elements, our current expectations for earnings are $8.40 to $8.60 for the full fiscal year, a $0.15 decline from the prior outlook, with most of that decline due to foreign currency fluctuations.\nFor the year, currency is now expected to reduce as reported revenue by $100 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.10. The primary drivers of this are the weak euro and British pound. Overall, our business continues to perform very well in this environment. The challenging environment we're in is no different for other companies.\nForeign currency fluctuations are limiting both top and bottom line. Supply chain disruptions are slowing our ability to ship capital equipment and higher interest rates may negatively impact interest expense. Despite these macro challenges, fiscal year 2023 is still expected to be another record year for STERIS.\nOur teams and portfolios continue to come together to better meet the needs of our customers and the breadth of our offering, allowing us to take advantage of several significant trends in the industry by leveraging our relationships to cross-sell within business segments and deliver value to our customer.\nThank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I will hand the call over to Julie to start the Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, if you'll give the instructions, we can get started on Q&A."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 11%, growth was driven by organic volume as well as 120 basis points of price.\nAcquisitions added approximately $253 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. Gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.5% as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs.\nWe continue to face increased material labor costs, which totaled about $20 million in the quarter as anticipated. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.6% of revenue an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year.\nThis is impressive performance as operating expenses, including R&D increased plus the continued headwind from supply chain and inflation. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.8%. Net income in the quarter was $205.4 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.04.\nAt the end of the fiscal year, cash totaled $348 million. We continue to focus on debt repayment as evidenced by our leverage ratio being now under 2.4x at the end of the fiscal year. Our focus on debt reduction provides us flexibility to continue making investments in growth capital expenditures and allows us many opportunities to continue to expand our businesses.\nYear-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $287.6 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $553.1 million. Free cash flow for the year was $399 million. As anticipated, this is a decline from the prior year due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel along with higher capital spending year-over-year.\nAs we look forward to fiscal '23, we anticipate free cash flow generation of approximately $675 million as the majority of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel have occurred. We also expect interest expense to be higher year-over-year as rates continue to rise.\nTotal nonoperating expenses net is anticipated to be about $95 million. In addition, we expect continue -- to continue reinvesting in our businesses with capital expenditures totaling approximately $330 million.

Tokich\n\nSenior VP & CFO, STERIS plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance.\nFor the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 9%. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 100 basis points of price. Acquisitions added $333 million to revenue, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables.\nTo assist you with your modeling within the Healthcare segment of the approximately $210 million in acquired revenue, about 60% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical. We passed the first year anniversary of the Key Surgical acquisition in mid-November. So this quarter, Key Surgical's revenue is split between organic and inorganic.\nGross margin for the quarter increased 90 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.1% as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were offset by higher material and labor costs. We continue to face increased material labor costs, which totaled about $10 million in the quarter. As we look at the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we expect increased pressure on material labor of approximately $20 million, about twice as much as we anticipated just one quarter ago. For the full fiscal year, we anticipate absorbing approximately $45 million in unplanned material labor costs all while continuing to serve our customers and deliver a record year of performance.\nEBIT margin for the quarter was 24% of revenue, an increase of 40 basis points from the third quarter last year. R&D expenses increased. And as anticipated, we are seeing operating expenses, such as travel and sales and marketing costs, return, somewhat limiting EBIT margin growth.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%, higher than last year, but in line with our expectations. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 21.5%, reflecting year-to-date actuals and our expectations for the fourth quarter.\nNet income in the quarter increased to $213.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.12.\nOur balance sheet continues to be a source of strength for the company. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $359.1 million. We continue to focus on debt repayment, as evidenced by our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter below 2.6x.\nYear-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $214.5 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $319.3 million.\nFree cash flow for the first 9 months was $300.3 million. As anticipated, this has declined from the prior year due to costs associated with acquisitions and integration of the Cantel Medical acquisition and higher capital spending year-over-year.\nI will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.\n\nDaniel A. Carestio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike, and thanks again to everyone for taking the time to join us today.\nFiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. Our year-to-date results have been strong despite headwinds related to supply chain and inflation that are impacting both revenue and profit. In particular, growth in our AST segment remains very strong with 21% constant currency organic growth year-to-date.\nHealthcare has also rebounded nicely with 13% constant currency organic revenue growth in the first 9 months and record backlog of $382 million at the end of the quarter.\nLife Sciences consumables have stabilized as anticipated and have contributed 5% constant currency organic revenue growth for the segment in the first 9 months. The capital equipment backlog in Life Sciences has also continued to grow to a record $117 million.\nAs our backlog in Healthcare and Life Sciences suggests, the underlying demand for our products remains very strong.\nDental revenue was about flat in the quarter, impacted by a slower-than-expected recovery in patient volumes. We do anticipate that, that revenue in the Dental segment will begin to rebound in the fourth quarter.\nThe integration of Cantel is progressing ahead of our expectations, as we indicated last quarter. We expect to exceed our cost synergy targets by about $10 million, and we are now approximately $35 million in total cost synergies in fiscal 2022.\nReflecting our strong performance to date, we are increasing our constant currency organic revenue outlook to the high end of our previous range and now anticipate approximately 11% growth for fiscal 2022.\nWe are also increasing our earnings per diluted share outlook and now expect earnings to be in the range of $7.85 to $7.95, or $0.10 above the high end of our prior outlook.\nWe do have a few known headwinds in the fourth quarter. We completed the divestiture of our renal business, which will reduce both revenue by about $45 million and diluted EPS by about $0.05 in the quarter. In addition, we expect supply chain inflation to be incrementally worse by about $10 million sequentially, as Mike discussed. We do anticipate that we can offset some or all of those headwinds with higher cost synergies from the Cantel integration and continued operational improvements. However, we are leaving some room on the downside of our earnings range to reflect the continued uncertainty.\nAll said, we are very pleased with where we stand today and the underlying strength of our diversified business. I want to thank all of the associates at STERIS for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers. We look forward to updating you all with our progress in the future.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A.\n\nJulie Winter\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, STERIS plc\n\nThanks, Mike and Dan. Matt, if you give the instructions, we can get started on Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Central Time.\nI will now turn the conference over to George Andersen, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSenior VP & Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, John-Louis, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today in Minneapolis is our Chief Executive Officer, Gunjan Kedia, and Vice Chair and CFO, Jon Stern. In a moment, Gunjan and John will reference a slide presentation together with their prepared remarks. A copy of the presentation, our press release and all supplemental consolidated schedules are available on our website at ir.usbank.com.\nPlease note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. These factors are described on Page 2 of today's earnings presentation, in our press release and in reports filed with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Gunjan and John will be happy to answer your questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Gunjan.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nVice Chairman of Wealth, Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking\n\nThank you, George, and good morning, everyone. If I could please turn your attention to Slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of 18.4% year-over-year. Our net revenue of $7.3 billion was a quarterly record, reflecting both strong momentum across our fee businesses and improved spread income. This quarter, we generated a very meaningful 530 basis points of positive operating leverage a return on average assets of 1.17% and a net interest margin of 2.75% and John will provide more details on our financial performance in his opening remarks.\nImportantly, we are making strong progress against each of our 3 strategic priorities for our company. We are generating organic growth through distinctive interconnected solutions. We are maintaining our expense discipline through sustainable process automation and we are executing on our payments transformation with greater focus and strategic investments. And as we manage the bank for the long run, through both positive and uncertain times, our highly diversified balance sheet and foundational risk management capabilities delivered improved credit quality and stronger capital and liquidity levels this quarter.\nMoving to Slide 4. Fee income diversification is a key source of strength for the company. On the left, you will see that fee revenue grew at 9.5% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting broad-based strength across our payments, institutional and consumer businesses. Notably, interest rate movements this quarter supported a meaningful acceleration in select capital markets and mortgage revenue. On the right, we highlight 5 key businesses that have demonstrated strong year-over-year growth and that we believe present a favorable growth outlook. Collectively, these businesses represented approximately 2/3 of our total fee revenue this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 5. We spotlight one additional business, Impact Finance. With the Union Bank acquisition, we bolstered our platform, bringing improved tax credit syndication capabilities, new talent and increased access to the California market. Currently reported within the other revenue, Impact Finance has grown at a 17% CAGR from 2021 to 2024, and is an important mission-driven capability that is core to our fee income portfolio.\nOver the next several years, we anticipate additional growth from a pull forward of activity tied to some recent executive orders and expect revenue trends across our environmental finance, affordable housing and community finance solutions to remain robust. In addition, the business also supports a net tax benefit to the company, which we believe will continue to be a meaningful driver of bottom line EPS growth.\nSlide 6 showcases a growing consumer franchise and long-term deposit strategy. Our deposit base is highly diversified across clients, geographies and products providing strength and stability through the cycle. We are actively working to increase our share of consumer deposits with interconnected products like bank smartly, branch and client center expansions, partnerships, and enhanced marketing and analytical capabilities. Consumer deposits now represent over 52% of total average deposits, up nearly 2 points from the third quarter of 2023.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our expense discipline over the last 2 years and execution on 4 signature productivity programs has resulted in improved organic growth and greater operational efficiencies. As you can see on the left, the outcomes of our efforts have been quite successful as we have seen steady improvement to both the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage as adjusted.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our payments transformation remains a key strategic priority for our company. As the charts on the left show, we have seen steady improvement and more consistent year-over-year fee growth over the last several quarters across both our traditional card issuing and merchant processing businesses. We are looking forward to providing a deeper dive into our payments transformation and strategy at an upcoming industry conference in the fall.\nLet me now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn C. Stern\n\nSenior Executive VP & Head of Finance\n\nThank you, Gunjan, and good morning, everyone. This is a very strong quarter for us, highlighted by core underlying business momentum and accelerating growth as we made meaningful progress toward our medium-term financial targets.\nIf you turn to Slide 9, I'll start with highlights for the quarter, followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. As Gunjan mentioned, we reported earnings per common share of $1.22 and achieved record net revenue of $7.3 billion this quarter. Revenue growth versus prior periods benefited from improved spread income driven by enhancements we've made to our portfolio mix as well as broad-based fee growth as we deepen client relationships across the franchise.\nElevated deposit flows at the end of the quarter in support of more robust client activity and seasonality in our Corporate Trust business, resulted in ending assets of $695 billion. As expected, nearly all key credit quality metrics, including nonperforming assets and net charge-offs improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. As of September 30, our tangible book value per share increased 12.7% on a year-over-year basis.\nSlide 10 provides key performance metrics. As the slide illustrates, each of our key profitability and efficiency ratios improved this quarter, highlighted by a return on average assets of 1.17% and a return on tangible common equity of 18.6%. Over the last 2 years, we have increased our tangible common equity approximately 30% while continuing to deliver a high-teens ROTCE on steadily improving earnings growth.\nNotably, we also delivered an improved efficiency ratio of 57.2% and a net interest margin of 2.75% this quarter. Our sequential margin expansion of 9 basis points was driven by fixed asset repricing, strong card and commercial loan growth as well as strategic balance sheet actions we took in the second quarter. We continue to expect net interest margin expansion in the medium term.\nSlide 11 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits increased 1.8% linked quarter to $512 billion, as we continued to emphasize growth in relationship-based deposits. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing to total deposits remained stable at approximately 16%. Average loans totaled $379 billion, up 0.2% from the prior quarter. Adjusting for loan sales last quarter, our underlying growth rate was 1.0% linked quarter and 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Loan yields increased to 5.97%, an 8 basis point improvement linked quarter. As we continue to strategically remix our balance sheet with a greater proportion of commercial and credit card loan balances, we increased both commercial and credit card loans 9.5% and 4.3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\nGiven the current industry focus on nondepository financial institution lending, we included a slide in the appendix of our presentation to provide additional transparency on this loan category. As you will observe, this is a highly diversified portfolio with a balanced and broad composition of borrowers that is underpinned by our proven underwriting capabilities and strong collateral and structural protections.\nFinally, as it relates to the balance sheet, the ending balance in our investment portfolio as of September 30 was $171 billion and had an average yield of 3.26%, an 8 basis point improvement sequentially driven by the strategic actions we took last quarter and fixed asset repricing.\nTurning to Slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.25 billion, an increase of 4.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Slide 13 highlights trends in noninterest income. Total noninterest income was approximately $3.08 billion. Excluding security losses, total fee revenue increased 9.5% on a year-over-year basis. driven by new business momentum and broad-based growth across our fee businesses.\nTurning to Slide 14. Noninterest expense totaled approximately $4.2 billion as we continue to prudently manage our expense base. Slide 15 highlights our improving credit quality performance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.43% at September 30, an improvement of 1 basis point linked quarter and 6 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, our net charge-off ratio of 0.56% improved 3 basis points sequentially and 4 basis points year-over-year.\nTurning to Slide 16. As of September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets was 10.9%, a 20 basis point increase linked quarter including AOCI, our CET1 ratio improved to 9.2%. At the top of Slide 17, we provide a comparison of third quarter results to our previous guidance. This quarter, both net interest income and fee revenues exceeded our expectations, while noninterest expense was in line with previous guidance, which drove meaningful positive operating leverage for the quarter.\nLet me now provide our forward-looking guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be relatively stable to our third quarter level of $4.25 billion. Total fee revenue is expected to be approximately $3 billion. Total noninterest expense is expected to increase between 1% and 1.5% sequentially. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 200 basis points or more on an adjusted basis.\nTurning to Slide 18. We are now operating within all of our medium-term target ranges, 1 year removed from our 2024 Investor Day and remain confident in our ability to build on these results over time.\nLet me now hand it back to Gunjan for closing remarks.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nVice Chairman of Wealth, Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking\n\nThank you, John. Third quarter results show that we are beginning to hit our stride on execution. We remain focused on delivering growth, productivity, returns and strong risk management, both in favorable and uncertain economic environments.\nLet me just close by extending my deep gratitude to our clients and shareholders. Our results reflect the power of our strategy the strength of our franchise and the dedication of our teams across this organization. We appreciate your trust and your partnership.\nWith that, we will now open the call for your questions.",

Thank you.\nCompany.\nThank you.\nSa.\nSa.\nForeign.\n\nModerator\n\nWelcome to the U.S. Bancorp second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star then one on your phone. If you wish to withdraw your question, please press Star then one again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 10:00AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference over to George Anderson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Anderson\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, JL, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Gunjan Kedia, and Vice Chair and CFO, John Stern. In a minute, Gunjan and John will be referencing a slide presentation together with their prepared remarks. A copy of the presentation, our press release, and all supplemental analyst schedules can be found on our website at ir.usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's earnings presentation, our press release, and in reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Gunjan and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Gunjan.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, George, and good morning, everyone. If I could please turn your attention to Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.11 on net income of $1.08 billion. Core growth across our diversified fee income businesses and continued expense discipline more than offset a lighter spread income. We delivered strong year-over-year EPS growth as adjusted of approximately 13%. Total fee revenue growth of 4.6% year over year reflected broad-based strength across our businesses and ongoing focus on execution and organic growth. John will discuss how we are navigating the current higher-for-longer interest rate environment and taking action to strategically position our balance sheet for near-term margin expansion.\nNotably on an adjusted basis, we delivered 250 basis points of year over year positive operating leverage, the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth outpacing expense growth. We generated an 18% return on tangible common equity, a return on average assets of 1.08%, and improved to a high 50s efficiency ratio. Asset quality trends and credit metrics remained stable, and capital levels came in well above regulatory capital minimums. Turning to Slide 4, we provide a high level view of U.S. Bancorp today. A few things to highlight for this quarter. Fee income now represents approximately 42% of total net revenue. We saw good sequential growth in total purchase volumes within payment services, and a Fortune 500 ranking improved from a year ago.\nSlide 5 provides an update on expense stabilization. This is one of our three major priorities. On the left you will see that we have successfully delivered now seven consecutive quarters of stable expenses. On an adjusted basis, we are driving meaningful productivity while also self-funding our investments in the franchise. For example, increases in payments and technology expenses were offset by reductions in personnel and occupancy costs. On the right we have highlighted a few of the digital investments we have made over the last five years to create modern, secure, and scalable platforms. We are now harvesting these investments to drive long-term productivity and sustainable positive operating leverage.\nSlide 6 profiles our businesses and the strategies we are deploying to drive organic growth, our second major priority. The businesses highlighted in light blue represent areas where we are pursuing new strategies or transformative approaches. In our capital markets business, we are focused on introducing new product capabilities that leverage our existing balance sheet such as ABS bonds, commodity hedging, and Repo. The Structured lending capabilities we are building are also delivering attractive growth in our C&I loans. In our payments business, which is our third key priority, consumer spend remains resilient, especially in the non-discretionary spend where we are slightly overweight. Corporate and government spend was muted this quarter reflecting caution around economic uncertainty.\nMerchant payment services revenue, which is less than 7% of total firm-wide revenue, grew 4.4% year over year, supported by our tech-led strategy and strong focus on five strategic verticals. The businesses highlighted in dark blue are areas where we expect continued growth through a sharper and more urgent execution focus. Finally, the mortgage, auto, and commercial real estate business portfolios highlighted on the slide in grey are core to our long-term growth strategies and are well positioned to grow when macro pressures ease.\nOn slide 7 we provide a snapshot of how our fee mix has evolved over the last 10 years in a positive way. While fee revenue as a percentage of total revenue was slightly higher a decade ago at about 45%, our revenue was skewed towards consumer fees which have elevated exposure to market volatility and regulatory pressure. These dynamics contributed to fee income as a percentage of total revenue falling to 38% in 2023.\nWe have been quite intentional in our strategy to invest in growing our trust and investment wealth and capital market advisory services, and today institutional wealth and payments businesses collectively represent more than 75% of fee revenue. These are stable and profitable fees with underlying positive macro growth drivers which support our sustainable revenue growth objectives.\nTurning to slide 8, we are approaching the evolution of our balance sheet in an equally deliberate manner. At quarter end, C&I and credit card portfolios represented 47% of the balance sheet. This is up from 43% at the end of 2023. This quarter these average loans grew 6.6% year over year, vastly outpacing total loan growth. These portfolios also support a higher percentage of multi service clients at 51%, and we are prioritizing growth in these segments.\nTo further optimize our balance sheet. We divested approximately $6 billion in mortgage and auto loans this quarter, taking advantage of a favorable rate environment for these asset sales to strategically reposition the balance sheet both for stronger growth and in support of deeper client relationships. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the quarter and forward-looking guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks Gunjan. Good morning everyone. This was a good quarter for us as we made meaningful progress towards achieving our medium term financial targets and work to position ourselves for future growth. If you turn to Slide 9, I'll start with some highlights followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends. We reported earnings per share of $1.11 and generated $7 billion of net revenue on flat expenses. Ending assets of $686 billion were impacted by seasonally elevated quarter end deposit flows. Credit quality metrics remained stable. A modest reserve release of $53 million this quarter was largely reflective of favorable loan portfolio sales we executed to reposition the balance sheet. As of 30 June, our CET1 capital level was 10.7%. Slide 10 provides key performance metrics as the slide shows, we are making steady progress on our medium term profitability and efficiency targets.\nLinked quarter, we delivered an improved return on average assets of 1.08% and saw our efficiency ratio fall to 59.2% while net interest margin declined 6 basis points sequentially. Approximately half of the decline was temporary in nature and will not carry into the third quarter. This decline was driven by strategic loan portfolio sales as well as high residential mortgage paydown activity in April. The remaining impact was driven by elevated deposit pricing pressures and rotation into higher rate products. Importantly, we remain focused on action and initiatives to strengthen net interest income, and those efforts are fully reflected in our guidance. Slide 11 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits decreased 0.7% linked quarter to $503 billion in line with seasonal tax payment outflows and our emphasis on relationship-based deposits.\nBalance sheet management supported a funding mix that prioritized both non-interest-bearing and low-cost consumer deposits. Average consumer deposit balances increased $2.4 billion or 1.1% linked quarter, while the percentage of non-interest-bearing to total deposits remained stable at approximately 16%. The deposit beta was 42%. Average loans total $379 billion, a decrease of 0.1% on a linked quarter basis. Balances were impacted by the sale of approximately $4.5 billion of residential mortgages and approximately $1 billion of auto loans. Excluding these sales, average loan growth was approximately 0.4% sequentially and 1.6% year over year. Notably, we strategically grew our C&I and credit card average loan portfolios 7.1% and 4.4% respectively, on a year over year basis. At 30 June, the ending balance on our investment securities portfolio was $174 billion, an increase of $3 billion from the prior quarter end.\nFixed asset repricing and reinvestment of proceeds from a residential mortgage sale into investment securities resulted in an 8 basis points increase to the average investment portfolio yield. Consistent with efforts to reposition the balance sheet, we opportunistically restructured approximately $1.25 billion of investment securities this quarter, resulting in a $57 million loss. The payback period on this transaction was less than two years and enhanced our net interest income trajectory. Turning to Slide 12, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.08 billion linked quarter. The competitive deposit environment more than offset the benefits of fixed asset repricing. Slide 13 highlights trends in non interest income. Total non interest income totaled $2.9 billion, reflecting security losses of $57 million from the repositioning of the securities portfolio. Excluding security losses, total fee revenue of approximately $3 billion increased 4.6% year over year.\nThis was driven by core growth and new business momentum across payments, trust and investment management, and other fee revenue. Turning to Slide 14, noninterest expense was $4.18 billion as we prudently managed expenses and further captured operational efficiencies across the business.\nSlide 15 highlights our credit quality performance. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.44% at 30 June, an improvement of one basis point linked-quarter and five basis points better than a year ago. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.59% and allowance for credit losses of $7.9 billion or 2.07% of period-end loans remained stable sequentially. Turning to Slide 16, as of 30 June, our CET1 capital ratio was 10.7%, a two basis point decline linked-quarter. Given strong capital levels and earnings accretion, we elected not to replenish a maturing credit risk transfer, keeping our CET1 capital ratio flat sequentially.\nResults of this year's stress test, which revised our preliminary stress capital buffer to 2.6%, further demonstrated the company's ability to withstand a severe economic downturn, which is a testament to the strength, quality, and diversity of our balance sheet and prudent approach to risk management. Importantly, our CET1 capital ratio including AOCI improved to 8.9%. At the top of slide 17 we show a comparison of second quarter results to our earlier guidance. As expected, slightly lower net interest income was more than offset by better than expected fee income of approximately $3 billion and prudent expense management. I'll now provide forward-looking guidance for the third quarter and full year 2025. Starting with the third quarter 2025 guidance, we expect net interest income for the third quarter on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of $4.1 to 4.2 billion.\nTotal fee revenue is expected to be approximately $3 billion. This compares to the second quarter total fee revenue of $2.98 billion. Total noninterest expense is expected to be $4.2 billion or lower. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 200 basis points or more on an adjusted basis. I'll now provide full year 2025 guidance which is consistent with our previous guidance. Compared to full year 2024, we expect total net revenue growth on an adjusted basis at the lower end of our 3% to 5% range. Our guidance assumes two rate cuts in 2025. For the full year we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 200 basis points or more on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 18, we continue to make measurable progress toward achieving our medium term targets.\nAs you can see on this slide, year over year we have improved both our return on average assets and efficiency ratio while delivering high teens return on tangible common equity and mid single digit fee growth. Let me now hand it back to Gunjan for closing remarks.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, John, and let me close on slide 19. Second quarter results were supported by a unique mix of diversified businesses that delivered strong sequential and year-over-year EPS growth. This quarter, the resiliency of our business model offset some rate-driven softness in spread income with good growth in fees and continued expense discipline. Notably, we executed on our key expense initiatives and delivered meaningful positive operating leverage. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we are intentionally evolving our business mix to be more fee-intensive and attractive to greater diversification while also shifting the balance sheet to support a higher percentage of multi-service clients and improved spread revenue. As we head into the back half of the year, we are well-positioned and executing with urgency on our three key priorities, expense discipline, organic growth, and transformation of our payments business efforts.\nThis quarter supported meaningful progress towards our medium-term financial targets and ability to deliver sustainable EPS growth. I'm often reminded that the true strength of this company is driven by the day-to-day actions and choices of our talented teams. So on behalf of all my U.S. Bank colleagues, I would like to thank our clients and our shareholders for their loyalty and support of our exceptional company. With that, we will now open the call for your questions.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. At this time, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster.\nYour first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning everyone. Thank you for taking the question. John, was hoping to start out on some NII dynamics. Maybe if you could spend a moment discussing where the margin goes from here off the 266 base. I think you mentioned part of the linked quarter decline was sort of transitory based on the actions you took in the second quarter. So what do you see as the best launching point, and kind of what would it take to move it higher or lower from here? In other words, the main puts and takes. I guess the final piece of it is maybe where we stand on the 3% medium term margin aspiration.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thank you, Scott, and good morning. First of all, yeah, you're right on the net interest margin. We had three basis points of the six that was really attributed to transitory things related to the sale that I that I mentioned, kind of a grossing up of balance sheet. So we expect that to reverse. I also expect sequential net interest income growth here in Q3 and Q4 as we move forward. You know, we have a lot of positive momentum on the asset side driven by a lot of strategic actions that we mentioned throughout our remarks.\nWe do have fixed asset repricing that will accelerate and be better than the first half of the year. We do the strategic actions we took in terms of the loan sales, as well as the investment portfolio repositioning, is going to help net interest income trajectory for the next several quarters, and then loan growth. We feel the pipelines are strong on C&I and card. We've been growing C&I at a 7% year-over-year clip. Card at 4% to 5% year-over-year clip. CRE is starting to turn the tide there in terms of not being as much of a drag in terms of growth, and in terms of deposits. We're being active in remixing our deposit mix.\nWe are intentionally. We moved out of some high-cost corporate and single-served client and we had moved into more of our consumer deposit base highlighted with our Bank Smartly product. So we feel very good about the trajectory of all these moves, and so that's going to help us both on the net interest income and margin side of things go forward. I would just say in terms of our 3%, there's no change. We, you know, obviously we know the margin dip this quarter, but it's never linear and we just, we have those drivers that I just mentioned that are going to help us see through that 3% over the medium term.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nAnd Scott, let me add one other point. Even on deposit mix, even on the institutional side, you will observe very healthy growth in Treasury Management fees and our corporate trust fees. These are processing business that bring operational deposits that are also favorable to our mix. So that is also, that focus will also help our NIM trajectory.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Okay, good. Thank you for that color. And then maybe as the follow up, John, when you talk about our guidance, when you talk about expenses being I think $4.2 billion or lower in the third quarter, maybe just a second on where that flex could come from if necessary and more kind of more broadly. I guess one of the concerns I hear from investors is that cutting costs to meet the operating leverage targets might just be preventing some necessary investments. Can you just sort of address that? I'm certain you all don't feel that way, but maybe if you could just spend a moment addressing it, please.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. We certainly don't feel that way. We feel all the initiatives and investments we have made, we are harvesting that for all these sorts of things. And as Gunjan mentioned in her comments, we are self funding in a number of the initiatives that we have, and so we feel very good about the levers that we had. It's coming from things like the real estate that's going to be a continual driver, the combining of certain areas have found us efficiencies within our operations, and other sorts of technology like groups. The productivity changes we've made and platform enhancements we've made. You know, AI is certainly a buzzword, but there are things that we are deploying that is being helpful and will continue to be helpful going forward.\nThere's just a lot of efficiencies and things that we are executing on on the expense side that's being helpful to us. We have continued our investment. We continued our investment in terms of our tech spend, in terms of our investments in the business. That has not changed. We feel really good about these things being pointed at our strategic objectives, where we want to grow.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI'll just add, Scott, you've covered our company for a long time, and you've seen us operate very effectively at an efficiency ratio much different from where we are today. It's a very streamlined, simple business mix. We are quite big in the businesses we are in. Our conviction that we can operate the company and invest in the future growth at a slightly lower efficiency ratio is very real. In addition to the digital investments that John talked about, I do want to say that the real productivity that is coming from having spent more than $5 billion in digital investments over the last five years is very real. You will observe certain line items over time increase like technology, sales and marketing expenses, and investments in our payments businesses because those are our strategic areas, and the real productivity will be in some other categories.\nSo we very much take the question that the productivity is not coming out of under investing in future growth.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. All right, thank you very much.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nI wanted to start, so Gunjan, for you, a bigger picture question, if you will. So if we look at the guidance you provided to the market, hold expenses flattish, deliver positive operating leverage, 200 basis points or better. That's been the guide. You look at this quarter. You basically did that, 250 basis points POL, maintain the outlook. Despite that, the stock, we'll see where it goes. It's down 4% right now pre-market. When you think of the financial targets, the desire to create shareholder value, is 200 basis points enough of an objective to get the stock working? And do you need to do more on the revenue side, right? To start moving the POL needle?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nIt's a very thoughtful question. Thank you.\n200 basis points of positive operating leverage is very healthy in the long term. The opportunity is in revenue growth. If you look at our portfolio and we really tried to disaggregate some of our business lines so you can see the underlying strength of how we have evolved the portfolio. The opportunities for growth are very, very real and that's where you will see us sort of flex the EPS growth. The expense side was an important.\nArea of focus for us just to get the positive operating leverage in place. And I look back and reflect also on why the stock reaction, and it's less about the targets not being appropriate, but whether there is enough sustainability and consistency of delivery against it. Which is why we report out sort of how we are progressing towards our medium term target. We are very confident that as the confidence grows in our ability to march towards our medium term targets in a consistent fashion, the stock would react to that.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay, that's fair. Maybe for John. Even though loan growth was negatively impacted by the mortgage sales, you guys did have very solid underlying C&I growth. And I guess this goes to Scotty's question a minute ago. But if we look at your funding right, assuming C&I loan growth continues to be strong, which is what we saw out of PNC yesterday. M&T, same thing. Talk about what is going to change from what happened this quarter, where you saw a migration to higher cost deposit products. How can you fund that with lower cost deposits and drive NIM expansion, say the back half of this year? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGreat. Yes, good question, Steven. I think your observation is correct, and we do expect, as I mentioned the previous question, growth in C&I and Card and things like that that are going to position us for higher growth on the asset side, coupled with all the other things that I said. So there's certainly the asset side we feel good about. On the deposit side, yes, we saw an increase of cost in that. But I think what we're leaning in is on the consumer side, which is appropriate because what we're doing is we're looking at things like our Bank Smartly product, which is a fantastic product for us. You know, it's a product where clients set up both a card and a checking and or savings account.\nWe have seen through this over 50% of the people that use this product is new to bank. We see that the multi-service client statistics on this product are 3x what we would normally have on the retail side. Our acquisition cost is a lot lower, nearly 1/3 of the cost we can take out in terms of acquisition with this product value proposition that we give to the clients. So over time, what we are seeing is an improvement in our deposit portfolio and improved flexibility of our ability to price as we move forward. That's really going to be the drivers of how we will manage over the long term our funding costs.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. And John, I'm newer to your story. Why didn't that help this quarter? The Smartly product like why is it going to help next quarter but didn't help this quarter.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThe deposits side was on the commercial and retail side. So I'm not going to say it's just all retail. This is a deposit story. What I'm referring to, as I think about the go forward deposit portfolio position, it's really about our flexibility and to move pricing as we think about the different deposit levers that we have, whether it's CD or the savings rate, as the Fed moves rates and things like that. We have more ability than we would have otherwise in our retail book as a result of this. And then on the commercial side we have a high beta already, a high beta type of product. So when the Fed does move, we can cut those rates or move those rates appropriately.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks for the color.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nHi, good morning. A couple of follow-ups there. One is on the C&I book, and can you give us some color on the driver of that acceleration in growth and where we stand now with line utilizations?\nYeah, that would be helpful, yeah.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou know, Betsy, it was the growth really in C&I was everywhere. It was very good to see. You know, I could give you the laundry list, but the highlights would be, you know, the utilization rate did tick up a little bit, just about 30, 40 basis points. And it's a continuation of what the trends that we saw last quarter. We saw strength in our ABS lending portfolios. We saw strength in small business led by healthcare and things of that variety. SBA as well, you know, our expansion markets, middle market that we've been growing in in various areas have been providing us nice growth year on year. And so there's just been a lot of good growth, and we have a lot of momentum, and the pipelines are strong.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nAnd Betsy, let me add just one other thing to your question. For the last few years we've been very intentional with also introducing new product capabilities, more structured credit capabilities, just reflecting a more sophisticated client base and their needs. So you're seeing the impact in these recent quarters of the groundwork that was laid over the last few years and similarly with credit cards.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nGo ahead.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGo ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nSo that's advancing the private credit side of the business. Is that partly what's going on with the structured credit?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThat's helping too,\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nas well.\nBut it's broader than that.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nOkay. And then just a ticky-tacky question, but were there any gains or losses on the asset sales you did?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nNo, there's nothing meaningful other than the reserve release that you saw this quarter.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Mayo of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Mayo\n\nHead of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, I think these are for you, John. Just.\nStill on the NIM. Did you say there was deposit competition? That was one of the drags on the NIM. And also, I think I see RWA up $9 billion in a quarter when loans were flattened. I didn't quite understand why that happened. Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Let me go to your second question first. On the RWA. Yes. $9 billion up, I commented. Just to reiterate, we had a couple things happen. One, we elected to have some of the credit risk transfers that we've done in the past to roll off. That was about half. The other half was commercial loan growth that we saw at the end of the quarter.\nWe saw strengthening, which is why we're commenting on C&I growth and saying that the pipelines are strong. There's a lot of activity. We felt like confidence improved throughout the quarter. So those are the underlying drivers for the RWA component. On the net interest margin side of the equation, I would say the deposit market is competitive. It has been for some time. I don't think anything is unique about this quarter versus others. Obviously, there was the market turmoil that started at the beginning of the quarter, but very quickly people bounced. The clients have been very much resilient, and we feel like the pricing is appropriate and rational.\n\nMichael Mayo\n\nHead of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. Now, just because we hear from some others that yield-seeking behavior has really died down quite a bit. But pulling the lens out just on asset-liability management, generally you're not running the firm just for the NIM or NII. You're running it for revenues and value creation over time. I get it. But is there anything that you need to change holistically with asset-liability management or that you've done over the past year that may show some results? Again, I'm just looking back, you know, a couple years, and you guys were caught with the unrealized securities losses, and that was an issue. And now here's NIMS falling short and it's deposits, and it just seems a little bit.\nYou know, not in sync with the industry. Maybe, as you said, it's going to pick up the next couple quarters, and this thing will be in the past. But just any general thoughts about the process of ALM at U.S.?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou know, I think I acknowledge your comments, Mike, but I think that what we're doing is a lot of the actions that we're taking right now are about positioning for the future. Some of the sales that we talked about, the positioning on the securities book, and everything like that, these are active actions that we're taking to move ourselves forward to get our. We had some charts in there about where we want to take the balance sheet and how that has grown into more support multi service clients and things of that variety. We have the ALM processes in terms of managing interest rate risk and things of that variety. So we feel very good about those capabilities.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI'd just also add, Mike, that we are strategically evolving both sides of the balance sheet to support a higher NII trajectory. So we have a very big mortgage book.\nIt grew a lot during the post-COVID era, and that's why the focus on credit cards and commercial C&I loans, which have a better yield characteristic. On the deposit side, in addition to the consumer deposit focus, you see, we are defending those.\nDefending market share there. We are also really growing out the Treasury Management and the corporate trust franchise so that the institutional deposit profile is very good. So there's a lot of strategic efforts to create a faster NII trajectory.\n\nMichael Mayo\n\nHead of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAnd just lastly, the 3% NIM, is that something that could be seen in a year, two years, five years, any sense?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, for all the drivers that we talked about, you know, we continue to expect that to be in the medium term. I would say that we have.\nAbout four cuts over the cycle remaining within that assumption. More cuts are more helpful. Fewer cuts make it a little bit more of a slower pace. So those are kind of the puts and takes to how we think about it. Otherwise, the initiatives that we were talking about here are positioning ourselves for that net interest income trajectory going forward.\n\nMichael Mayo\n\nHead of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nJust on the balance sheet trends. I appreciate the loan growth color you gave and some of the deposit dynamics in terms of the growth outlook from here, is it. I know previously you had pretty much described it as modest growth on both fronts. I believe, on loan growth and deposits. Can you maybe just update us how you're thinking about it now? Particularly since you're seeing some acceleration in the underlying trends within commercial and you're seeing some growth in card. How are you thinking about that now? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, thanks, John. I think certainly when we started the year, as we were thinking about the budgeting, we looked out and assumed a modest pace of loan growth that more or less has transpired. But what we're saying and seeing is that there's been acceleration and focus, strategic focus on C&I and Card for us, which you are seeing play out in terms of our 7% C&I year-over-year growth. And we continue to see that and expect that to continue, the card growth. We continue to expect to see that as well. So we're, as I sit here today, we're better positioned on the loan growth side, or we see better growth opportunities than we did at the beginning of the year.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. All right, thanks. And then, in terms of your revision to the 3% to 5% revenue guide, you cited the lower end. Now, how much of that decision to revise that was coming from the NII headwinds? And I guess, also put the other way, what are you seeing in terms of your growth expectation as you look at the trends in payments? Are you comfortable still at the mid single digit growth level for overall fees and within the payments businesses as well?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, absolutely. Yeah. Let me start. So total revenue obviously is the two parts, and I'll start on the fee side. We feel very good about the momentum that we're building. Highlighted a number of those items on her comments on the institutional business side, trust and fund services, we continue to gain market share, market activity, so that's going well. Treasury management, Gunjan highlighted with our newer capabilities, merchant processing, we feel very good. They've had a couple quarters now of increased year over year growth. We continue to or we expect to see that to continue to improve given the strategies that we're putting in place there. Our tax credit activities within the other revenue have been growing very nicely for us this year, and I would expect our other revenue to be north of $150 million for the remainder of the year.\nSo all these things are really at that, plus the things in capital markets and other areas. We feel very good about our fee trajectory going forward, and that's embedded in the guide that we provided to you on the net interest income side. I think sure it's been a little slower than at the beginning of the year, but we think that there is acceleration that can grow because of the things that we talked about. It's embedded in our guide for the third quarter. You know, I'm not going to repeat all those things again, but that's the essence of it and why we feel like we'll be at the lower end of the range.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nRight. Thanks for that, John. Back to the fees and payments. Still comfortable with the mid single digit range?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYes, yes, absolutely.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. All right, thank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Erica Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes. Hi, good morning. My first question is for John. John, I'm wondering if you could share, you know, your LCR ratio. I guess you know, to continue on the theme that a lot of analysts have brought up. We're all scratching our heads because so far none of your larger, or similar size, or smaller peers have really talked about this outsized commercial pricing pressure, and you know, given sort of overall flattish loan growth in the quarter, and then, you know, the sale of some of those loans, I guess I'm wondering, you know, why was there any sort of liquidity optimization reason behind paying up for those deposits?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nNo, there's no liquidity concerns. We have very healthy LCR ratios. We feel very strong about our portfolio. It's all; these are all actions we're taking to help our business objectives as well as our strategic objectives that we've talked about as well as our position positioning for net interest income go forward. So it has everything to do with that and nothing to do with liquidity side of things.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. My next question is for Gunjan, and I think Scott asked this.\nIn the beginning of the call, but I just wanted to maybe re-ask it a different way. Clearly you're embarking upon an inflection point for the company and the stock hasn't yet reacted. I think a lot of the disputes discussion with longer-term investors has been.\nReally honing in on the focus going forward. So what I mean by that is it struck me that you mentioned in your prepared remarks expense management as number one, and organic growth as number two. And you also printed the word harvest, which is not necessarily a word that we've heard from someone like, you know, J.P. Morgan. I guess like the question here is did we just really underappreciate the modernization that USB was going through over the past five years and that there's a lot of sort of excess expenses to recycle because it just feels like focusing on expenses to drive positive operating leverage may be good for the near term. But as I think about your longer-term shareholders and what they own, they typically own some of like the revenue new outperformers like a J.P. or a Morgan Stanley and such.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nErica. Good morning, and thank you very.\nVery thoughtful question, and I appreciate the opportunity to just react to the totality of the thesis here on us and just. I know you know our company very well, but I'll just go back a few years to describe the reason for the priorities. We did a very attractive acquisition two years back. We were very efficient to integrate it, but we went into the banking crisis with a depleted capital base, and our focus at that point was to very quickly rebuild our capital, which we did. It caused some trade-offs in terms of expenses because we had just integrated a big bank and just not enough attention to the revenue growth story. My focus on the expenses is entirely short-term because it's the fuel that helps create positive operating leverage and also helps us invest in our growth businesses.\nI would say that our portfolio of businesses is actually very attractive. There's an extraordinary amount of organic growth opportunity in our 10 core businesses, and they're very balanced across multiple business cycles. So we definitely expect to be a growth story. But you really do have to build credibility, positive operating leverage, and bring the efficiency ratio down because that's the model we want to scale over time. To your point on did you underinvest the productivity benefits of the technology? Yes, these are very real and.\nOn top of that, we are seeing the power of the AI.\nTools that we are deploying. So we expect productivity to be a meaningful contributor to bottom line growth. You know, I'm hearing your questions and the concerns around it, but if you just step back, we had 13% growth in EPS. We had very healthy positive operating leverage. We are down to 59.2% for our efficiency ratio. We had very strong fee growth that are strengthening over time in all the right ways. And the portfolio mix, both the fees, the balance sheet is all strengthening and improving. So outside of the day to day noise of this particular quarter, if you just look at the trajectory of the franchise, we are in a very, very good position.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you, Gunjan. I think investors will be warm to what you said about focuses on expenses is entirely short term, and that you're looking forward to growth. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Erica.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy and Large-Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nHi, Gunjan. Hi, John. Morning, John. I may have missed it, and I apologize. On the strategic sale of the portfolio that you identified, can you share with us why that action was taken? But second, could there be further or additional sales later in the year of parts of the portfolio?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. I'll start on the mortgage side. That was about $4.6 billion in total. So consistent with our comments around growing the balance sheet, we obviously have a slide in our deck talking about why we want to position our asset mix to multi service clients. The mortgages were legacy Union transactions with a single service type client. And so and they were a certain vintage, it was a certain yield type.\nThat we found an opportunity with the rate markets, et cetera, this quarter to effectively get out at par. We have reinvested those proceeds within the investment portfolio and gained a spread of probably 1.25 or so. And we got a little less than half the quarter of the benefit this quarter, and we'll pick up the rest full quarter obviously in the third quarter. But it's really about the mindset here, is really about.\nShifting the balance sheet, being intentional about our asset mix, and moving our balance sheet to support more multi-service clients, which is going to drive fee revenues, net interest income trajectory, and all those things that we've been talking about.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy and Large-Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nVery good. Thank you for the color. And then Gunjan, maybe you can share with us what's your view and the bank's view about stablecoins? It appears that it's very likely stablecoins, with the potential passage of the COIN Act down in Washington, will be real soon. And how do you think that might impact your payments businesses as well as your deposits?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you. We are expecting that the bills will pass and stablecoin operators will be operating in the industry. In some ways it's one more payment rail. And so the first level of focus is just interoperability. So when it starts to be operational, we should be able to accept.\nProcess stablecoins as well as.\nInteroperate within the banking system. So that's sort of what our focus is. We are quite ready to pilot our own stablecoin. There's a lot of partnership capabilities in the industry that allows you to stand that up. So we accept that this will be here. The use cases that we hear most about why this was needed or why it was important are cross border in nature today, and as you know, they are institutional in nature, and we do not really have a big institutional cross border payments business. Our payments businesses are a large card issuing business, and there are a large merchant which is very focused on the small business and largely focused on the US. So we do not expect it to be sort of material to our payments business anytime soon.\nI think the issue though is if it does become a consumer day to day P2P type of a product or a pervasive institutional payments product, then it would compete with Treasury Management Services. Gerard, I'll tell you, there are a lot of things to be yet sorted out, both from a technology standpoint and the market structure. So I would just say at this point we are quite ready to participate in it, quite ready to engage in the industry discussions around stablecoin, but not anticipating immediate revenue impact.\nTo any of our businesses.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy and Large-Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nThank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Morning, John. Just wanted to ask you real quick on the third quarter NII outlook and a little bit on the wholesale deposit costs. So I think you had mentioned in the conference circuit that, you know, there was just a kind of a hold back on giving customers some deposits. So I'm just wondering on that first point you mentioned, you can start to bring down wholesale deposits when rates come down, but is there anything different about how you see that going in terms of a beta perspective? You guys used to be one of the faster up and down beta companies. It's a little slower this cycle so far. So what's changed or what's the nuance in the current environment about that? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure.\nSo a comment at the conference was really about, at that moment in time, there were some conversations regarding that. I would say that largely abated, and I would say as the quarter moved on, the quarter became all about just a general deposit environment that is competitive, which is constantly competitive. So we're always competing. We were very intentional this quarter, as I mentioned, in terms of growing our consumer deposit base. And we have been focused on that for some time. It just shows up more now this quarter than it perhaps has because we also.\nLet go of some higher cost deposits on the institutional side. You know, nothing really fundamentally changes on the beta side of the equation. We, at the beginning of the cycle, had talked about getting around 50% or getting to 50+ in terms of the beta. That assumed, of course, some sustained rate cut cycle. Obviously, this cut cycle has been a little bit different, but we assume that if the rate cut cycle persists and continues moving forward, we get back to that level. And it's the same drivers as we've talked about in terms of our mix of institutional versus retail. And so we still feel good about that assumption.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Just given the moving parts that came through in the second quarter and the lower starting point, can you just help us understand 4.1, 4.2? Like, is there a bias on one side or the other, that range? And what would be the, you know, what would be the, you know, get you to the bottom or get you to the top. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp",
    "content2": "Sure. So you know, in terms of the puts and takes, obviously, you know, the competitive nature of where rates go on the deposit side, that's going to be obviously one piece. I wouldn't say in the third quarter a Fed rate cut or not is going to meaningfully drive anything different. I think the loan growth acceleration in C&I and CARD is real and that can definitely help and be more on the plus side, the strategic actions we have taken this quarter certainly have helped as well. And so these are all things that are adding up for us to be within that range for sure. And in terms of bias, there's no bias one way or the other. We just have to see how things play out. But we set ourselves up very nicely for the quarter.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, thanks a lot. John.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of U.S. Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question.\nA lot of focus here on deposit cost and deposit competition. But if I look at the actual increase in interest bearing or interest bearing liability costs, the much bigger impact came in short-term borrowing costs, which were up $32 million, and long-term debt costs, which were up, I think, close to $60 million. So in aggregate, those two things are up close to $90 million or about three times the impact on funding cost deposits. And it all entirely was due to much larger balances there. So just normally you would have a corresponding positive impact on the asset side in terms of things like excess liquidity, but it didn't seem to happen. Can you, John, walk us through what happened here and is that sort of just a one time.\nIncrease that should go away? But just what's going on on the liability side beyond deposits? That seems to be.\nA drag here.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So let me take the other side of the liability part of your question, so I'll break it out. So on the short-term borrowings, we did have an increase this linked quarter, and a lot of that has to do with the increase to fund the.\nSecurity purchases. This is the gross-up on the loan sale. So when we put the loans up for sale, we also did our security purchases, and we knew the loan sale would occur within a month or so or a month and a half. And so we just used short-term borrowings temporarily to help support that. And so that goes away. That's part of the NIM story that I talked about earlier, that short-term borrowing cost goes away next quarter. Long-term debt. We have steadily.\nImproved our profile in terms of our debt coverage and things of that nature. We want to make sure we're in balance in terms of relationship between loans, deposit, and long-term debt. We feel like we've grown into that mix appropriately. And so I don't see us growing that from here on out. From this particular level, any issuance we do will just be here to replace other maturities and things like that. So the combination of those things are really kind of get to the heart of your question.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of U.S. Financials Research, HSBC\n\nSo the short term borrowing should revert next quarter and you have a little bit less pressure there. And is there a negative spread on those incremental short term borrowings that should go away in terms of just thinking about the $NII impact of that happening next quarter?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, the short-term borrowings are going to be on the margin on the higher end of the rate. So if you think about the 430, 440 type of range, you know, maybe even more than that, potentially it's going to be on the higher end. And so as we had the loan proceeds loan sale happened, we could also terminate the short-term borrowings associated with that, thus improving the margin.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of U.S. Financials Research, HSBC\n\nOkay.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI mean, I'll just, you know, outside of the details, it's worth just pointing out the why behind all of this. It takes a big chunk of loans that.\nWe can redeploy to a much faster NII trajectory. Although it created noise in this quarter because of the double, you know, the double counting. So I do want to just emphasize that point that these were actions we took in various parts of our balance sheet to just really evolve it to a more attractive mix.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of U.S. Financials Research, HSBC\n\nYeah, that's helpful. Then maybe just a quick one on payments and what the expectations are there. I mean on the issuing side, I guess we're leapfrogging or lapping, sorry, the prepaid headwinds and should see some acceleration there in the second half. And just any color on how you're thinking about corporate payments. You mentioned just economic headwinds there. But are you optimistic that we'll see some improvement on the corporate payment side as we head out as we go into the second half?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, yeah. On the corporate payment side, I think the themes that we saw on the spend levels within corporate T&E and government spend impacted this quarter. I would anticipate that impact kind of continues into Q3. But then after that I think that abates and we have, what will take over is our initiatives that we have. We have a strong pipeline. You can kind of see that pipeline well in advance of bookings. And so we feel that will be very helpful and positive going forward. But maybe a little bit of short term here in Q3 on the issuing side of the equation. It's going to be a continual continuation of kind of what you saw this quarter. Obviously we lapped many of the prepaid headwinds that we saw.\nThe growth rate that you see there is reflective of just kind of where the market is. That's probably a good marker for where we are in the second half.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI can just add a little bit stepping back from any one of the businesses. Both our payments leaders are now in place since February. The transformative strategies are very much in place. We are supporting their efforts through this productivity that we are creating in many, many parts of our business. There's the CPS, the corporate. While they are looking at the muted spend this quarter, their sales pipelines are very, very robust. The product is very attractive in the market. Even merchant is very steadily posting.\nStrengthening fees. We feel very good about the initiatives underway in payments and the execution against those.\n\nModerator\n\nGot it, thank you.\nYour next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. Just had a couple of follow up questions, and apologies if I missed it. On the pace of buybacks, adjusted CET1 hitting 8.9, I'm assuming crosses 9% next quarter. Does that mean anything in terms of should we see the $100 million go to $150, $200 starting Q3? I mean, is the Street pricing that or forecasting that? Would love kind of how you're thinking about adjusted CET1 relative to the outlook for buybacks from here.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure.\nEbrahim, good morning. You know, in terms of the buyback, you know we had $100 million, which is consistent with the prior quarter. You know, we have been continuing to do a good job in terms of balancing growth in our capital levels. As you pointed out, getting to 8.9% on AOCI is a good thing, and we continue to glide into our new capital ratio, but we're also focused on distribution. You know, certainly we anticipate growing that over time. The question we have is for this particular third quarter, as we are more upbeat about loan growth and things of that variety. We'd rather deploy it there than, you know, $50 million or $100 million on the share buyback. I'd rather deploy it on the loan side of the equation, at least here in the short run.\nOver time, we are very much committed to getting back to that approximately 75% payout, and that's really what we are focused on, achieving that goal quarter to quarter. We'll lay that out for you, but that's our intent.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it.\nJust two quick ones. One, when we talk about fees, I think if I go back a year or two, there was a lot of excitement around commercial products revenue. We saw sort of pretty decent momentum that's flatlined over the last four to five quarters. Anything going on there? Like is there still a significant opportunity there, or have we kind of captured most of it?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. I don't know if I acknowledged the flat for several quarters. It was double-digit growth last year, and the last two quarters, yes, it's been a little bit more, you know. I think the activity we saw this quarter.\nReally was very strong in some of our ABS and new product capabilities, commodities derivative activity with the market movements. We saw a lot of great growth there. It was offset, though, by a little bit lower investment grade underwriting, high yield underwriting, things of that variety. I view that as temporary. We still have all of the conversations we've had on our capital market side still very much in play, and we feel very, very confident about that going forward.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nEbrahim, we are very confident about the capital markets story. Just as a reminder, our franchise does not include core equity trading or investment banking. It's a very defined group, and the nature of the opportunities is our very large balance sheet that is being deployed with corporate clients that have very deep loyalty to us. This product set just helps us get our fair share of fee revenue from the balance sheet that is already being deployed. The product buildout is really a talent play. You have to get the right expertise in place. We did see some muted growth just for the last two quarters, and the sentiment we are hearing is just a little bit of a caution around the tariff discussions, the rate movements, to say.\nIf you look at the long-term trajectory, and certainly outside of the last two quarters, the growth rate for some time has been very, very strong there.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThis last one, if I can ask both of you, like your narrative around fees, payments, expenses sounds very, very strong. I think the fleet lacks confidence in the NII outlook. Right. We came in April day count benefit.\nFelt like NII was going higher.\nJust talk to us, your degree of confidence that as we kind of what you've laid out in terms of NII should grow from here. Like, what could go wrong to not make that happen, especially as we think about the opportunity of getting the NIM to 3% over the next maybe 12 to 18 months. Thanks.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nLet me start and then John, please add on here. Ibrahim, we are, you know, we are a very fee intensive franchise. We are at 42% of our total revenue, which is really very intentionally up. That is what sustains our earnings stability over multiple business cycles. That is what sustains our very exceptional returns, you know, an 18% ROTCE return. We are very committed to the fee side of the business, the NII side. We have confidence, but we are also doing it in a very multi-serve client strategic way. When we keep reiterating the points around how we are building out the Treasury Management capabilities, operational deposit capabilities on the institutional side, and even on the consumer side, really improving the mix there. Client acquisition on the consumer side takes many forms.\nYou know it's expensive to build out branches, it's expensive to run marketing campaigns, it's expensive to retain deposits through pricing and deposit-based rewards. We do have confidence that the entire franchise works to deliver consistent EPS growth over time, which is what you've seen over the last two quarters. That's the overall confidence in our revenue growth story and our EPS growth story, while maintaining very strong return profiles. What would you add, John?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou know, in terms of the net interest income as you mentioned, I feel very confident about our ability to grow this quarter, just given all the things that we talked about. I won't repeat what Gunjan just said, but clearly, you know, we've taken actions that are going to position us much better. If there are bumps in the road, for whatever reason, we weather that, and we feel that way, very confident.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's good that you feel confident because I agree with Gunjan, lots of good things going on. You had 20 questions on NII and yields and all of that.\nSo.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nEbrahim, we acknowledged that because, you know, we did three different transactions to position the balance sheet. Takes a little unpacking of why did we. I appreciated Erica asking the question around the liquidity because if there was any question mark that this was because of a liquidity, it wasn't. I hope as we have had this conversation and as you understand what we are trying to do with the balance sheet, it's setting us up for a very attractive portfolio, both on the NII side and the fee side. I appreciate the dialogue there.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nI appreciate that, and I think there's a lot of skepticism, and I'm hoping you give less things to skeptics to pick on and more to the non-skeptics. Hopefully we made a shift there. Thank you so much, both of you.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood advice. Good advice. Thank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. One final follow-up on the magnitude of the fixed rate asset repricing benefit that should persist from here. Can you discuss where you still see the greatest repricing potential across the left side of the balance sheet, and anything that you would say to give investors confidence? You've addressed this in different questions, but the idea that those repricing tailwinds are going to show through and not be tempered by other actions we saw this quarter. Anything that you could say there? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. What I would just say is that in the second half we'll have more volume. We've given you ranges in terms of investment portfolio and loans.\nWe were probably on the low to mid side of that range the first half of the year. We anticipate to be on the mid to high end of that range in the second half of the year. The spreads are holding in nicely, and I feel like we have good momentum on that, as well as we're getting more juice from the investment portfolio repositioning that we did of the billion and a quarter sale there, as well as the $4.6 billion mortgage sale. Those are two key drivers that are going to help the overall positioning.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty of KBW. Your line is open.\n\nChris McGratty\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Research, KBW\n\nOh, great. Good morning, everybody.\nJust wanted to look at slide 16 for a moment on the capital. A lot of questions and a lot of discussion about the operating leverage that's in front of the company. I guess my question is, is there a scenario with the improved regulatory environment that you would consider another bank acquisition to help accelerate what you're trying to do on the NII front?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\nYou know, the capital is building very nicely, and as you know.\nWe are flirting with the Cat 2 designation, and one of our reasons for building out the capital is to be ready for a 2 designation. Our focus very much is on organic growth, and our planning for the Cat 2 transition and the capital build is based on organic growth profiles. I would say to your question, the capital is built to support organic growth as we transition to a Cat 2 category designation.\n\nChris McGratty\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Research, KBW\n\nOkay, great. Thank you for that clarification. Maybe a reminder of when the organic cross. Any changes to where you're thinking about crossing into Cat 2?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nNo, no changes there. We've talked about no earlier than 2027, and I think you can see where our asset trajectory is, and that's very consistent with what we've talked about in the past. No change there.\n\nChris McGratty\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Research, KBW\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O’Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Any outlook comments on credit? The charge-offs have been amazingly stable. You had a little cleanup in CRE, with the C&I behaving very well. Any thoughts on just the overall level of charge-off and reserves going forward? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, thanks. Thanks, Matt, and appreciate the credit question.\nOn the outlook there, the environment is very stable to improving from a credit standpoint. We saw obviously a stable net charge-off ratio this quarter, but all the other metrics are declining or in good shape. Even where we had things like a 90-day up a little bit, that's all. There are some administrative loans in there as well that have already cleared, as well as some of the California fire impacts. All the metrics are pointing positively on things like card and net charge-offs. Just in general, we expect on the card side of things this year and 2025 a better charge-off rate than 2024. We expect the net charge-off ratio to remain here or improve, meaning going down in the coming quarters. We feel very good about our credit profile right now.\n\nMatt O’Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, just that last comment. The charge offs, so the card charge offs lower this year versus last year. Did you mean overall charge off overall?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nOverall and coming down. You know there's some seasonality to charge off next quarter to go down. We expect that to happen. Just overall, when you look at 2025 net charge off, that's going to be lower than 2024 per card.\n\nMatt O’Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah.\nAll right, thank you.\n\nModerator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nI'm sorry to beat a dead horse. Just a little bit of clarity. I hear everything you're doing on NII and remixing the balance sheet with the sale of the RESI mortgages.\nMost of that obviously when I look at the segment data which shows up in the corporate segment. When I look at your corporate segment and I hear you doing the multi client and operational deposits and all that, I look at the net interest spread and that continues to come down every quarter and was down more sharply. Given everything you've just said, why does that continue to come down?\nBy the way, it was downlink on the consumer side too, but more trying to understand first on the corporate side what's going on.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. A couple things there, and I think you're talking about Vivek, just to make sure, the segment reports that we provide on the consumer side as well as the commercial, just to make sure I'm tracking. Yeah, a couple things are going on in there. The mortgage sale will be shown in the.\nConsumer side of the equation that will take place in terms of the spread, net interest spread side of things. I think what's going on there more than anything is on FTP, they're just, you know, there's less credit for those sorts of deposits, and that's just kind of given the pools and all that sort of thing. I wouldn't, I think looking at the broader picture of NII is really the way to go for that.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nA couple of other little questions. The C&I growth that you were talking about, what are you seeing in terms of growth to loans, to NBFIs? How much of that growth has come from this particular segment?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, NBFI is a part of the growth that we saw this quarter in C&I. It's probably, for this quarter, I would say, close to half of the growth that we have there. As I said earlier, there's growth in virtually every other category, whether it's corporate loans, just in general, small business, healthcare, expansion markets on the middle market side of the equation. We've had a good mix of all sorts of growth in that area.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. One last, just a confirmation. You've talked recently about tech spend running at about $2.5 billion. Just want to confirm, is that still the number at which it is?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYes, correct.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nModerator\n\nWe have a follow up question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nYeah. Hey, I just wanted to make sure I understand how many more quarters or years you're planning on doing this balance sheet restructuring. You know, I see that the held for sale EOP went up QQ, so I'm assuming you're, you know, you're in train. How long should we expect this is going to be continuing for? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nJust to make sure I understand. I mean, yes, the held for sale is up this quarter because of that loan sale that we had been talking about. You know, the investment portfolio actions that we take, you know, are, you know, we've done a few of these over the last couple of quarters. It depends on interest rates. We always are looking at the market. I don't have anything in the plan necessarily as I look forward, but you know, we're opportunistic when things come our way, and the paydown, or excuse me, the payback period is appropriate and things like that, that's when we take action. You know, I can't answer. I don't think you're ever done, Betsy, repositioning the balance sheet in the right ways that you want to, to meet our client needs and make sure we're hitting our strategic objectives.\nThat's really how we're running it.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nYeah, I know Gunjan talked earlier about bringing down RESI as a percentage of total, which you have significantly over the past year. I'm wondering if there's a target RESI percentage that you're.\nMoving towards, if the market is there to help you move towards it.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou know, I just want to say we are very committed to the RESI business. It's the core financial product that is nearest and dearest to a lot of people's financial affairs. It's been muted for some time, but in a different rate environment, it is a very good source of fees and loan growth. It had just become oversized, especially with the Union Bank acquisition as well. This was opportunistically appropriate for us. There is not a target to try and bring it down to. It's based on the needs of our customers, just making enough space on the balance sheet to accommodate the business growth that will come shortly, because it's been a few years of muted growth.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Mo\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and U.S. Large-Cap Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nModerator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, I turn the call back over to you.\n\nGeorge Anderson\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, JL, and to everyone who joined our call this morning, please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. You can now disconnect the call.\n\nModerator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\nSa."

If you wish to withdraw your question, please press star, then one again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Anderson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Anderson\n\nDirector of Investor Relations for, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Julie Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm joined by our President and new Chief Executive Officer Gunjan Kedia and Senior Executive Vice President and CFO John Stern. In a moment, Gunjan and John will be referencing a slide presentation together with their prepared remarks. A copy of the presentation, our press release, and all supplemental analyst schedules can be found on our website at ir.usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty, factors that can materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's earnings presentation, our press release, and the reports on file with the SEC. Following Gunjan and John's prepared remarks, we will be happy to take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Gunjan.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, George, and good morning, everyone. As we begin the call today, I want to first take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our friend and colleague, Terry Dolan, who most recently served as our Chief Administration Officer. We have truly appreciated the outpouring of support we have received from the investment community since his tragic passing last month, and our thoughts remain with his friends and family. If I could turn your attention to Slide 3. In Q1, we reported earnings per share of $1.03 and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 17.5%. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our strategic priorities and achieved year over year positive operating leverage of 270 basis points this quarter. On an adjusted basis.\nOur continued discipline on expenses. Good momentum across our fee businesses and modest margin expansion all contributed to us achieving our third consecutive quarter of revenues, outpacing expenses on an adjusted basis. Importantly, our credit quality and capital levels are strong this quarter. Our net charge-off ratio improved modestly and we continued to build capital.\nWe are in an environment of intense market and economic volatility. However, our management team has successfully navigated through a wide range of conditions over the years and we are prepared for a variety of possible scenarios. Our consistent and deep culture of risk management will continue to be a competitive advantage as we go forward.\nSlide 4 is a snapshot of U.S. Bancorp today. As the largest non-G-SIB bank in the country, we operate at considerable scale in the markets we serve. Our franchise is quite unique. Fee income represents 41% of total net revenue and is driven by an extensive and diversified product set. Today, 2/3 of our businesses operate nationally through an optimized digital and physical distribution model. Our client franchise of almost 15 million clients has strong loyalty and depth with us. These advantages are important to our unique and ongoing growth story. I'll turn you to slide 5. As I step into my role as Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Bancorp, I want to reaffirm my commitment to our medium-term targets. The macroeconomic backdrop has shifted since our investor day in September, and I acknowledge that there is still considerable uncertainty to the outlook.\nHowever, a wide range of plausible forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios still support our targets.\nI have three immediate strategic priorities to achieve our goals: tightly manage our expenses, drive organic growth across our business, and transform our payments business.\nIt is important to emphasize that while we are focused on organic growth, we remain deeply committed to high returns and a disciplined risk management culture.\nSlide 6 gives you more color on our expense management program. We have been actively focused on reducing expenses since early 2024. Our investment spend has stabilized and is increasingly shifting to growth oriented investments. In addition, we are structurally driving productivity through all our operations. As the chart on the left shows, we have now delivered six consecutive quarters of expense discipline on an adjusted basis. This has been an important funding mechanism for organic growth and a significant driver of the positive operating leverage we have delivered. On the right are our four expense programs. These are well underway. These initiatives are designed to improve sustainable productivity and balance that with high quality client service, and operating effectiveness.\nNotably, we have additional levers we can pull and are watching the revenue environment closely to appropriately balance and flex our expense programs.\nOn slide 7. A diversified mix of fee-generating businesses is truly a competitive advantage for us. On the left, we are disaggregating the dynamics of fee growth last year. Confidence in our medium-term fee growth targets is supported by the strength we have in our core businesses like trust and investment management and capital markets fee businesses, as well as the execution momentum we have across our other organic growth initiatives. Headwinds around consumer fees and the sale of our ATM cash provisioning business are also dissipating and support stronger fee growth going forward. We are focused on leveraging a broad range of products and digital capabilities to deepen relationships with our clients and expand our reach through partnerships.\nI'll move to slide 8. We have an opportunity to do better with our payments businesses. Money movement capabilities are critical to anchoring client relationships, and we are committed to building a vibrant payments franchise. Our payments business drives both fee income as well as net interest income with $42 billion in attractive average loan balances. Net interest income is an important part of our payment story, and as you can see on the left, we have grown our average loan balances in line with or better than the industry. Our loan growth has benefited from a range of competitive products that offer quite attractive value proposition especially to borrowers. Total purchase volumes across all of our payments businesses were at $925 billion this quarter for the trailing twelve month period. The growth here could be stronger, and our target is to be more in line with the market.\nWe have a greater focus on the affluent customer and products like Bank Smartly were designed specifically to target this segment.\nAs I look ahead with two new leaders in place since the start of the new year, we are actively redeploying expense saves to scale up our execution, our sales and marketing efforts, and payments. Some areas of focus are California, where our acquisition of Union Bank has given us access to a large and affluent consumer and small business base, and the expansion of our Elan franchise, which currently serves over 1,200 financial institutions across the US.\nFinally, while our merchant acquiring business contributes just over 5% of total U.S. Bank revenue, it is a unique part of our portfolio and I know one that garners a lot of attention from the investment community as it is a key differentiator for the company.\nWe are in the middle of a multi-year transformation here to reposition this business in three ways. The first is greater interconnectivity across the bank, the second is a sharper focus on five industry verticals, and the third is a strategic shift to a tech-led operating model that is more consistent with the buying behavior of consumers. Today, tech-led represents over 1/3 of total merchant processing revenue, and most of our revenue generation is now concentrated in our five targeted verticals. We have most recently moved up to number five in Nielsen's 2025 report ranking for processing volume, and we do have more room to grow here.\nOur medium-term fee growth targets for the overall bank expect a mid-single-digit growth rates for payments with more upside beyond that time frame.\nFinally, before I hand it over to John, I want to highlight a simpler management structure on slide 9. We are very fortunate to have a deep management bench and I am confident we will execute with urgency on our priorities.\nNow let me turn the call over to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward looking guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks Gunjan. If you turn to slide 10, I'll start with some highlights for the quarter followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.03 with year-over-year top line revenue growth, and disciplined expense management. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see that most credit quality metrics and capital levels improved both sequentially and year-over-year. This quarter, a more favorable portfolio mix and improved asset quality resulted in a small reserve release of $10 million. The allowance this quarter also included some incremental qualitative reserves to reflect increased tariff-induced macroeconomic uncertainty. Our loan portfolio is well diversified, and we are appropriately reserved and prepared for a wide range of potentially adverse macroeconomic conditions.\nOur CET1 capital ratio increased 20 basis points to 10.8% this quarter as we continue to balance ongoing capital accretion with modest share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share was $25.64 at 31 March, up 13.8% year-over-year. Slide 11 provides key performance metrics. Our return on average assets and net interest margin improved linked quarter from solid financial performance, continued expense discipline, and efficient balance sheet management. Slide 12 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits decreased 1.1% on a linked quarter basis to $507 billion in line with seasonal patterns and continued prioritization of relationship-based deposits and pricing discipline. Both our mid-40s cumulative deposit beta and percentage of non-interest-bearing to total deposits of approximately 16% remain in line with expectations.\nAverage loans totaled $379 billion, a modest increase of 0.9% on a linked quarter basis driven by commercial lending initiatives that were partially offset by higher paydowns within our commercial real estate portfolio and continued runoff of auto loans. At 31 March, the ending balance on our investment portfolio was flat at 171 billion.\nThis quarter. The average yield across both our investment portfolio and loan book were impacted by lower short end rates, which more than offset the benefits of fixed asset repricing, and improved asset mix. Turning to slide 13, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.12 billion, relatively stable to the fourth quarter after adjusting for two fewer days as expected.\nSlide 14 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 5.0% on a year-over-year basis driven by payments and trust and investment management fees. Linked-quarter revenue was impacted by seasonal declines in both payment services and other revenue, while our decline in trust and investment management fees resulted from less favorable market conditions. Turning to Slide 15, noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion, stable with adjusted noninterest expense in the fourth quarter and consistent with our previous guidance.\nContinued expense discipline and operational efficiencies partially offset seasonal increases in performance-based incentives and merit, as well as a higher charitable foundation contribution. Slide 16 highlights our credit quality performance on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.45% at 31 March 2024, an improvement from the previous quarter and a year ago. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.59% improved 1 basis point linked-quarter, and our allowance for credit losses totaled $7.9 billion or 2.07% of period-end loans at 31 March 2024. On Slide 17, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased 20 basis points to 10.8% as of 31 March 2024 net of distributions.\nOur CET1 ratio including AOCI was 8.8% during the quarter, we completed $100 million of share repurchases, and moving forward we expect the level and pace of buybacks to remain modest as we balance continued capital accretion with distributions, and further evaluate broader macroeconomic conditions. Turning to Slide 18, we wanted to provide some additional clarity on our projected balance sheet trajectory and the drivers of net interest margin expansion. These drivers are supportive of our medium term target. As the slide shows, we do not expect to become a Category 2 bank before 2027. Further, we expect that our trajectory will benefit from an improved asset mix, fixed asset repricing, and continued optimization of our funding mix. The timing and ultimately where we land within the range provided will depend on several factors including the path of interest rates and loan growth.\nMoving to Slide 19, our first quarter results met the guidance we provided in mid-January. We are monitoring the ongoing discussions around tariffs and recognize that uncertainties remain. I'll now provide second quarter and full year 2025 forward-looking guidance based on our current expectations. Starting with the second quarter 2025 guidance, we expect net interest income for the second quarter on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of $4.1-4.2 billion. Total non interest income is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion. We expect total non interest expense to be $4.2 billion or lower in the second quarter, and we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the second quarter of 200 basis points or more on a year-over-year adjusted basis. I'll now provide full year 2025 guidance which is consistent with our previous guidance.\nTotal net revenue growth on an adjusted basis is estimated to be in the range of 3% to 5% compared to the full year 2024. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage of greater than 200 basis points for the full year.\nSlide 20 shows that we have made measurable progress toward achieving our medium term targets compared to Q1 2024. We have improved both our profitability and efficiency ratios and have continued to enhance our capital positioning and operating leverage trajectory. We have more work to do, but we are pleased with our progress to date. I'll now hand it back over to Gunjan for closing remarks.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, John. Let me close on slide 21. I am excited to lead our exceptional bank into the future. Over the last two years we have been focused on integrating our Union Bank franchise and then swiftly building back capital after the banking failures of 2023. We are now focused on organic growth, and our momentum on expenses is timely as we navigate a highly uncertain environment, and that gives us strategic flexibility.\nMoving forward. My top priority is to restore investor confidence in our story and our execution. Finally, on behalf of our US Bank team, I want to sincerely thank Andy Cecere for his 40 plus years of thoughtful, dedicated, and steady leadership. We all wish Andy well in his retirement. With that, we will now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad and we'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster.\nOur first question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Gunjan and John. Before I ask my question on behalf of all of the bank analysts and the investment community, I really want to offer our sincere condolences about Terry's tragic death. Not only will he be missed by his family and all his colleagues at U.S. Bancorp. He will be missed by everybody on this call and throughout the investment community. All of us will keep him and his family in our thoughts and prayers.\nOn the question, John, can you go back to your comments about the yields in the portfolios, how you referenced that the earning asset yields came down for the quarter and you pointed out, I think on slide 12 in your comments that the impact of lower short-term rates more than offset the benefits of the repricing of fixed-rate assets. What's the ideal interest rate environment for U.S. Bancorp in your view?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, Gerard, and first of all, thank you for those comments. They mean a lot and we appreciate that very much.\nOnto your question on the yields within the portfolio, ideal positioning, and things like that. Just more, you know, from a technical standpoint, the investment portfolio, you know, about half of the AFS book or about just over a quarter of the book in total is floating rate in nature. Of course, we have a lot of hedges in place and to protect from shocks on higher rates, to protect capital in that sense. So that's the positioning for it. That positioning along with how we manage the rest of the balance sheet provide us how we think about interest rate sensitivity and how we want to position the bank from interest rates shock. So today.\nEven though the investment portfolio has some.\nMix towards floating rate; we have other things that can offset that, such as receive fixed swaps on the commercial loans, as an example. And so when you put it all together, we have what we'd like to have is a neutral interest rate risk position on the balance sheet. Neutral to shocks. Now ideally we would like to see a more upward sloping curve that will be more beneficial to us. Lower short end rates would help our funding position, and longer and higher longer term rates will help with the repricing of our fixed rate assets. So those are kind of the puts and takes as we think about the balance sheet.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI appreciate that, John. Then, as a follow-up, you talked about your capital levels, your CET1 ratios, especially including the AOCI at 8.8, which of course is well above your required level. You're still being cautious on the buybacks. Historically, as you all know, you folks have traditionally given back 70% -80% of annual earnings in buybacks and dividends. What kind of environment will we need to see for you guys to be comfortable to get back into that kind of 70% -80% return of earnings to shareholders and buybacks and dividends?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So I think as we talked about at Investor Day, we talked about our capital ratio and where it needs to be. We targeted approximately 10% on a Category 2 basis, which you just cited, that the ratio where we're at right now, and you know, we still are awaiting, you know, capital rules and things like that. Obviously there's more favorability there with the regulatory environment. But we are, as we get closer, we would anticipate, you know, that we would increase our share repurchases as we approach and achieve that approximately that 10% capital level. And the numbers that you cite, that 70%, 80%, that's a number that we provided to you on a full payback in our Investor Day, and that is consistent with our thinking.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat.\nAndy, good luck in retirement. I wish you a lot of future success. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first of all, I'd echo Gerard's sentiments and thoughts as well. Maybe John, within the 3% -5% full year revenue growth target, any change in sort of the expected balance between NII and fees? I know you talked previously about sort of mid single digit fee growth aspiration for the year. So maybe just within your response if you could sort of speak to any updates on main fee drivers throughout the year with like a particular emphasis on the payments momentum that you would see developing, if possible.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So thanks, Scott. You know, first of all, you're right. No change to our guidance. 3% -5% is our expectation.\nAnd we acknowledge of course that the market is uncertain. There's things in the tariff discussions that everyone is watching. We acknowledge that. But we still feel good about our revenues and our ability to execute. On the net interest income side, we shared a slide in terms of how we see a path of how net interest margin will grow that starts with fixed asset repricing and better mix in terms of our loan book. On the fee side of things, we still believe the mid single digits is an appropriate way to think about fee growth for the year. Gunjan commented on the payment side of things and we have good initiatives beyond that as well as in other parts like capital markets, trust, and investment management, and all these other sorts of things.\nAnd then importantly, I know you didn't ask, but expense, we have a lot of levers there as well which you know will help us achieve operating leverage that we have talked about in terms of 200 basis points or more for the full year. So you know, we understand the market has changed but our clients are resilient and we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, perfect.\nThank you for that. And then maybe sort of a top level one. Can you all sort of address what you're seeing just in terms of some of the consumer spending patterns? I mean for your size, just given the payments business, you see sort of an outsized amount of spending. Just curious, you know, what changes, if any, you've seen since all this uncertainty really ramped up and if there's been any change in particular since early April when things really began to hit in a bigger way.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nScott, let me start there. We saw a modest pullback in consumer spending early in the year, and that was very weather related, and it has stabilized towards the end of March.\nWe are watching the downward trend in consumer sentiment but not seeing that in US spend patterns. Our mix does tilt towards the more affluent customer and towards non-discretionary everyday spend patterns. So that could be an explanation. But we are seeing steady consumer spend patterns in the first quarter.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect.\nAll right, thank you both for all the color.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John McDonald from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nYes, hi, good morning. Gunjan, wanted to ask you a little bit bigger picture on the payments business. You've acknowledged it's been a little bit disappointing relative to what you see as its potential. Did we collectively have too high expectations for payments the last couple years or is it a question of needing to get further along in this short shift towards the tech enabled in order to better align the business with the industry dynamics?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning John. It is a very good question.\nIt's not anchoring too high. The industry is quite attractive. The way we manage our business is quite focused on margins. So, I think the right way to think about our personal aspirations is to have a very nice balance of margin and growth. What we are seeing here is that the balance sheet side, the NII side, of the payments business is actually very attractive, and it is tracking with the industry. And our product offerings historically have been quite attractive for the borrower segment. So, we like that. We want to continue that. We are leaning in on also the affluent transactor segment with a new lineup of products that is attractive to them. So, we can also augment a fee growth.\nSo our expectation would be that we would be in line with the market on volumes and we'd maintain our margin, and it will be a very healthy accretive sort of trajectory for the overall payments business for us. And then of course I always want to remind you that the reason we are in the payments is not because it's a standalone attractive business. It's a very, very attractive product to anchor our client relationships across all banking products. So that's sort of our expectation for payments.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, great. And then John, a question on expenses. You can put this in the category of no good deed goes uncriticized. You've done a great job keeping quarterly expenses flat for a bunch of quarters in a row. Now can you just remind us why that still enables you to invest enough to play offense against some aggressive payments competitors and a bunch of offense-minded banks that are expanding throughout the country?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, I think the beauty of our expense programs is we've been able to take a lot of the savings that we've had and invest it in and continue to invest. You know, John, we talked in Investor Day about how our investment has over the years has gone more from defense and building out.\nYou know, all the infrastructure needed to more offense or more 2/3 offense versus 1/3 defense. When we think about our CapEx levels, which is in that kind of $1.25 billion, we have OpEx and tech or our total tech amount and that kind of $2-$2.5 billion on an annual basis. And so we continue to invest in all the products and capabilities that Gunjan has been talking about. And so we feel really good about the levers that we have. And that's been part of our plan is to take savings and continue to invest and be offense-minded about it.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I also thank you, Gerard, for saying that. Team, I will always remember Terry's big smile and warm embrace.\nAnd Andy, so all the best for you in your retirement and I hope you enjoy every moment of it. Back to business. Gunjan, just a follow up to the last question. When we think about the market here that you're trying to match the growth rate of, maybe you could give us a little bit of an understanding as to what market we are talking about.\nWhen I speak with investors on.\nThis topic, I hear many different thoughts on what the market is. Is it pure play merchant acquirers? Is it.\nOther banks in the payments ecosystem, of which everybody is obviously or leaders in that regard. It would just be helpful to understand what your definition of market and market growth rate is? Thanks so much.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Betsy. And thank you for your remarks for Terry and Andy. So first, we think of market as being US, not global, because the growth rates are different. We have a credit box, a very specific intentional range that we target. So we think about that which is not sort of super, super, super prime, and it's certainly not subprime. We're very well positioned, sort of in the right mix of yield versus charge-off rates in that middle to high segment. And then the third is we want profitable margins. So we do actually in our internal thinking think of the big, big e-commerce, large box retailers as a different growth rate because we're very committed to high returns, and that market is big enough and growing healthy enough for it to be a very vibrant business for.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. Then just a follow-up is on lending in general. I noticed your C&I lending was quite strong this quarter. Anything in payments there? I did notice that your C&I lending commentary in the press release had to do with a majority of that coming from non-bank or non-depository financial institutions. So could you give us some color on that? And is payments a part of that NDFI? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So Betsy, I'll start with that. So on the commercial side, we, in commercial loans, we did see nice growth there. There's really three drivers as I, as I think about it. We had some growth in ABS lending, which is what you were referring to, that obviously was a driver. We had greater utilization rate, and that was across the board and throughout the quarter. It wasn't just at the end of the quarter. It persisted, and it hit, and it was all markets, and we were up 50 basis points. And I'd say we're getting closer to kind of our long, very long term normal rates in terms of utilization, which is, which is good to see.\nAnd then the third thing is we've been seeing nice growth in our middle market loans, particularly in expansion markets where we have been growing, as we, on one of the pages that we have, we signify where those expansion markets are. So those are the three things that.\nWe saw, during the quarter, for the growth that you mentioned.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. As well said by Gerard and Betsy on the tragedy.\nGunjan, you're now CEO of U.S. Bancorp. But I guess as of yesterday, and you did highlight some changes in management to make it more simple, interconnected focus on the five verticals. You said your number one priority is to restore investor confidence, and you can see by the stock price it's not the valuation it once was. You said you want to have better expenses, organic growth, and payments leading the way to better returns. And always superior risk management. So hopefully I summarize that. Okay. And I said at investor day, like Andy, I love you, but unfortunately I didn't love the stock price performance.\nSo restoring investor trust would be getting that confidence back to the company, which would lead to the stock price. So Gunjan, I mean sometimes you have all star teams or often you have all star teams that lose to regular teams. And so you can have a lot of good players. It just doesn't work out. So I'd say, just from a stock price standpoint, it hasn't worked out over the longer term. So Gunjan, strategically, I know you're doing a lot of continuation, but what are you doing differently now versus Andy? I know you're next to each other and your partners and all that, but I want to know how you're different. That might evolve US Bancorp to better performance that would lead to higher stock price and your number one goal, restoring investor confidence. Thank you.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning, Mike. So let me just start by acknowledging that I'm not happy with the stock performance as well. So we feel the urgency and we hear the message.\nThe priorities that I have laid out do reflect my observations and what we need to do differently. So the expense discipline, which was very core to the U.S. Bank story, needs to come back. And you've seen us make very strong progress there. That allows us to not just deliver the positive operating leverage and the efficiency ratio targets.\nThat we are aiming for, but also invest in organic growth. So it's a sustainable performance trajectory. The second thing is, as you know, US Bank's history has been to grow through a series of acquisitions. And then in more recent times since the GFC, to outperform through risk management, we do need to build out the organic growth muscles. So the focus on taking a very exceptional set of businesses because our portfolio is very attractive and amplifying their performance, especially in payments, are all the priorities that I think say things need to be done differently. And finally, it just comes back to a culture that will show a very different level of urgency around execution. So again, I'll close my remarks by just acknowledging your comments that we have an exceptional franchise and we're very confident that the results will be better going forward.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI appreciate that. When you look at the five verticals, that might be the first time you mention it. What are the five verticals? And you said that's most of revenues and what's the opportunity to move the Union Bank franchise up to the U.S. Bancorp levels?\nBecause it seems like those would be.\nSome organic growth opportunities. Thanks.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThat is indeed very. It's an important organic growth opportunity. Here you are talking about merchant businesses. Just a reminder, the merchant MPS business is about 5% of our overall.\nBank, but a very important differentiator for us. It's a very competitive space. The reason to think about focusing on the five verticals is you can build stronger tech-led value propositions for each of the verticals. They are very large verticals. They are retail services, travel, entertainment, and health care. The more we have focused our acquisition efforts and our organic growth efforts on those verticals, the deeper and the better execution we have. Today about 90% of our revenue focuses on those verticals.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd Union Bank, the potential to move that up to your level.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo Union Bank is a very affluent franchise, a very attractive franchise, more than a million plus clients, 200,000 small businesses where we are there is about 2/3 of the penetration on the consumer side relative to where we are on the rest of the franchise, and less than half on the small business side. So getting those two U.S. Bank levels in the medium term is a very important growth opportunity for us. Now you didn't ask, but let me just talk about a second one too, which is our Elan franchise. You know we serve 1,200 financial institutions in a white label way across the US. That platform has really improved just last year. We have made some very nice enhancements to the user experience in the core platforms, and that's another growth engine that we are very excited about.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erica Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYes. Hi, good morning. My first question is for John. Just wanted to unpack on slide 18 your comments of a medium term net interest margin of 3% plus, medium term representing 2026, 2027. So typically when we've seen this kind of uplift from the 270s, it's because there's some sort of, you know, some hedges that are roll off. And I'm looking at your core CRE yields, and I compared it to peers that aren't super hedged, and there doesn't seem to be a mismatch there. Your bond yields are a little bit lower than peers. I'm wondering, and I couldn't really tell from your swap disclosures at Investor Day what could be optimized. But beyond rates, what is the balance sheet optimization plan to get you from the 270s -3%?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Erica. So a couple things there in terms of the hedges and just how we're progressing here. You know, what we're signifying there is the loan growth and investment portfolio.\nMix as well as the repricing. So a lot of this is mechanical in terms of the repricing I mentioned before. We have $5 -7 billion on average per quarter that roll off on loans, fixed rate loans that will reprice 150-200 basis points better, and then an investment portfolio, $3 billion on average for the quarter. And so those at the same levels as well, 150-200 basis points. So those things will help drive up net interest margin over time as well as how we think about the mix of our loan book. So repositioning to things that have higher yield, better returns, those sorts of things. The other component of it then is on the deposit and funding side, and that is going to have a little bit of market attached to it.\nSo to the extent the Fed cuts and funding costs go down, that will accelerate our trajectory on net interest margin. If we stay at a flatter rate or inverted like we are today, on the short end of the curve, then it could take a little bit longer. That's just contemplated within this guideline. So those are the things that we are considering now. You also made a comment on hedges. Just to be clear, there is really no net interest income impact from our hedges. The pay fixed swaps that we have on the investment portfolio from an accrual standpoint completely offset receive fixed swaps we have on the commercial loan book. So you may look at peer comparisons. I know that's hard to do because you don't see every single swap and all that sort of thing.\nBut at the end of the day, when you put it all together, all these rates were, all these hedges were put on in roughly the same zip code of rates that we are today. And so the accrual of all of it is negligible to the net interest income.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. My second question is just maybe re-asking Gerard's question another way. When we got together in September during Investor Day, you unveiled a $5 billion buyback.\nYou talked about a modest pace of buyback activity and pegged it, I'm guessing, to the 10% x AOCI number improving to 8.8%.\nThis quarter, if I recall correctly. I think there was some commentary in September about being back half weighted in 2025 in terms of the buyback activity. I guess as I think about.\nThe opportunity I'm guessing based on Gunjan's comments, you think that the stock is inherently undervalued. Obviously the macro isn't helping the value of the stock either.\nWhat is our marker? Is our marker now the 10%?\nCET1 including AOCI, Tier 1 or.\nHave things changed because of the economic uncertainty in terms of the buyback pacing?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, so it's a number of things, Erica, that we looked at. I mean obviously in September we talked about.\nOur new buyback program and how we will balance out distribution.\nWith capital build. We continue to see that and want to do that. We've been doing a good job in managing higher our capital levels as we mentioned the 8.8%. But we aspire to be at 10% on a CET1 basis. So as we kind of move forward, our objective is to continue to grow the share repurchases over time. But in the meantime we want to make it more balanced. We want, we want to continue to grow capital and we are mindful of other things such as loan growth, such as the macroeconomic environment. Share price obviously matters. All those things we have to consider. That's kind of the glide path that we talked about and that's still consistent with what we mentioned back in September.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nAnd John, I'll just add, Erica, we are very committed to the overall distribution levels and getting to that in due course. So this is really a matter of managing the transition, especially in a time like that, prudently and not being in a rush to do something small, but very committed to the long term distribution targets we have.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. I guess first just want to echo what Betsy and Gerard said.\nBut in terms of.\nThe question.\nJohn, I just want to make sure I'm not putting words in your mouth, but did you bless that you believe that absent any macro shocks, the margin should be a 3% average for 2027?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo we didn't necessarily say that, Ebrahim. What we're talking about is our expectation is that we will achieve 3% net interest margin over the medium term 2026 or 2020, those are the two dates that we have in mind. It's not an average or anything, it's just achieving that level. The speed and pace in which we can get there really depend on.\nWith respect to at least the last one, the curve shape, deposit environment, and then bonus would be loan growth as well, which we have a very modest amount in our forecast given the environment that we're in. The first two are fairly mechanical and are very much in our control. And so that's the third; is more of the flip; is more the item that we're watching more. And so that's kind of what we meant by that. Those comments.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. I guess just a separate question on expenses. Laser focus on operating leverage. It's been flat. Is it fair to assume that we could see multiple quarters of flat to lower expenses.\nIn the kind of revenue growth backdrop that you have talked about or guided for, given all the efficiency opportunities within the bank, or is that being too aggressive?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nIbrahim, let me start there. What we are managing to is delivering positive operating leverage. To the extent that the revenue picture has some uncertainty to it, we are flexing our expense base to deliver both positive operating leverage and invest back into growth. So what you should be looking for is the consistent positive operating leverage, and the expense base will depend on the revenue environment.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning Gunjan and John, and thank you for taking my questions. Following up on your expense commentary, your 200 plus basis points of positive operating leverage is very clear in your guidance. But is it reasonable to expect that positive operating leverage could break above 300 basis points given the continued tailwinds from fixed rate asset repricing that are fairly mechanical in nature? Your NIM commentary, John, and sort of just that expense trajectory that you've been on, understanding there's a lot of uncertainty at a macro level, but you know, sort of steady state with where we are, would that be a reasonable expectation?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Bill. So I think, you know, in terms of operating leverage, just to reiterate what Gunjan said.\nWe're looking at obviously growing our revenues through a number of different initiatives that we've talked about and how that comes to be. Obviously there's a macroeconomic environment that we have to acknowledge, and to the extent that that is better than what we had expected, then we will grow expenses to match that. If things are on the other side, then we'll flex down, and we have the levers to do that. Ultimately, we're talking about achieving over 200 basis points of positive operating leverage, and that may bounce up and down a little bit above that level quarter to quarter based on the circumstances of that quarter. So could something hit 300 basis points? It could, it's possible. But we would likely want to invest and make some additional investments during that particular quarter.\nSo that's going to be the throttle that we think about as we move forward.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, John. Separately, on credit, your flat, relatively flat reserve rate seems consistent with stable asset quality across your consumer commercial portfolios. But maybe if you could just discuss what you're hearing from clients who are most exposed to changes in tariff policy? There's still a lot we don't know, but can you give us a sense for whether your client base is more exposed to the risk of a potentially more significant credit event versus simply just slower growth that would be relatively manageable?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Bill. So, broadly speaking, we're not seeing anything overall. It's way too early. As you said, the commentary changes, changes frequently. And so we're all waiting and watching. However, all that said, as you would expect, we have a very strong credit and risk management team. They have an idea of the subsets of portfolios that we look at that would be all the natural players that you would think of when you think of tariffs on things like automobiles, and building materials, and things of that variety. So when you think of that sort of thing, you know, the important thing is also understanding the client, because each client is going to have a different supply chain, different unique circumstances. So it's really about understanding the portfolio and getting ready for those sorts of events.\nWe're hopeful for it, but we're also acknowledging that there are conversations out there on tariffs and we want to be prepared for it.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you for taking my question.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, John. If I could just clean up a couple of quick things. Can you just let us know what curve you're now using in terms of cuts in the 10-year relative to what you gave us in January?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So right now our most recent forecast includes two cuts, one in the summer and one in the fall from the Federal Reserve on the short end. And then the long term rates are pretty much in the zip code of what we have today throughout the course of the year. So that's effectively what our expectation or our projections are at this point.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, cool. And then a couple quick things on fees. So in the payment side, you had talked previously quarters about prepaid card getting to a run rate. Did that happen in Q1 and kind of going forward any other things we should be thinking about outside of seasonality in terms of just the kind of organic growth rate of payments?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So prepaid card had some impact this quarter. That's all completed now. It was worth a couple points within that line item of the card book. That's all completed now. And so going forward, I would expect normal seasonality that you would expect from, and we've talked about that or had that in our slides in the previous in terms of the trends that we see from a seasonal basis. So all those things still hold, and that's our expectation going forward.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And last one just you mentioned, I think, in your remarks about how the corporate services capital markets had a good DCM or, you know, debt issuance type of quarter. Do you see some of that as either, you know, pull forward in the environment or just, can you just talk through your general pipelines for the capital markets side of that corporate services business? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Yeah. The capital markets business continues to show a lot of growth opportunities. We've been growing our client base both in terms of high-grade as well as.\nInvestment grade as well as high yield, the foreign exchange and derivative or client interest rate derivative businesses have very strong pipelines. The market volatility has been very good to those businesses as we continue to build that out. So we have a lot of momentum in that space, and we feel really good about it as we march throughout the course of the year.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks John.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI",
    "content2": "Good morning. Just a follow up there. On the fee side, I know you cited mid single digit growth expectation on fees, and I just want to see if you can more explicitly break that down by the various lines, how you're thinking, and if that's changed from previous. And more specifically, I'm interested in card. I know, I think you have pointed out in the past that you're confident in a mid single digit growth rate in card in 2025, but it was up about 1.5% year-ove-year this quarter. I know you mentioned card spend was weaker earlier in the quarter and stabilized in March. But how is mid single digits attainable when you're coming off of this level and there's uncertainty in the macro outlook. Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So you know, in terms of mid single digit growth, that's for the entire fee complex that we have, not just Card. Card was impacted, as I mentioned, with the prepaid item for Q1. But as we get beyond that, then we expect to grow. And you know, the payment trends that Gunjan spoke of was really a temporary phenomenon in terms of the weather. So that's really what we saw there. We expect to see growth in that as well as areas like trusts, capital markets that I just spoke of, and things like that.\nOther revenue was also up, and I would mention, you know, we've given a range of $125-150 million. I would expect that to be on the upper end of that range as we move forward throughout the course of the year. So it's those sorts of things that are driving us for that mid-single-digit growth, four-digit growth for the fee.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nComplex, and again excluding that, the prepaid card, and then the weather dynamic, I mean.\nDid you achieve, would you say, about a mid-single-digit growth year-over-year pace on an adjusted basis in the card business?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, card grew at 4%. Credit card, just overall, forgetting the prepaid for a moment. So we're at that pace. So we feel good about the trajectory.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, got it. All right, thanks for that, John. And then separately back to the operating leverage, not to beat a dead horse, but the 200 basis point expectation. And I know you had indicated several times that you do have some levers if revenue does come in weaker, and we all worry for the industry as a whole, as we're looking at it right now, revenue may come in weaker. So like what are the areas that you actually have leverage? What areas can you pull back materially in costs where you already haven't done? So I just want to see if you can kind of maybe walk through that because it's clear that you're investing and you're in the middle of still of a transformation in payments and obviously strengthening your organic capability. So curious where the real levers are in the cost base.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So you know, in terms of the cost base, a lot of the programs that we listed on our slide deck is really programs that we have on.\nExpenses. Some of these things are short term that can be realized immediately, some take a longer time to implement. The timing of that matters in terms of the levers that we can pull. As we've talked about with operating leverage, we have flexibility within that expense, those expense programs to increase or increase the pace of savings or not depending on the revenue and volume. Obviously we're watching the revenue environment like everybody else. This is just the number of things that we can do, whether it's real estate, automation, or looking at our org structures and things of that variety we have control over. Those are the sorts of levers that we have.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nAnd John, I'll just add that the flexes in how much we reinvest back into the business, the expense savings we are focused on driving. So the flex is just how much we invest back in the business.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, great. Thank you, Gunjan. Thanks, John.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nHi, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to Slide 18 and drill down on that. And if you, if they run the map.\nOn that slide and.\nThink about what it implies for net interest income. You have $700 billion plus of average earning assets in 2027. If I assume the ratio of earning assets to total assets is roughly constant from here and apply 3% NIM, you get to over a $19 billion net interest income figure for 2027, which is.\nA CAGR of over 5% from 2024.\nYou know, versus 2025 where the growth is probably going to be less than that. It kind of implies almost high single digit growth, and on the back end of that, 2026 and 2027, and it's well above, you know, our estimate or consensus. So I'm curious what, you know, your reaction to that is and are you.\nDo you think consensus is too low?\nFor net interest income? And you know, in addition to that, what are you, I assume you're, you're assuming, I think you're assuming low single digit loan growth, and you know, the long end of the curve kind of staying where it's at. But you know, just anything, any additional details on some of the underlying assumptions would be helpful as well.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, Saul. Thank you for that. So, you know, what we wanted to project is just our thoughts on what our thoughts are on, particularly on the asset side, how the balance sheet's going to grow, as you suggest. If you do the math on just kind of the midpoints of those ranges, it's really a kind of have a low single-digit growth, which implies the loan growth is.\nThat's what we see and that's what we forecast now. It certainly could be bigger than that depending on how the economy evolves, et cetera. We don't know that getting out to 2027 and making a call on net interest income is very hard to do, obviously. I won't do that here. I'm just offering a page to share with you our thoughts on how the net interest margin will evolve over time. It really is driven by the two things that are quite mechanical and are in our control, which is loan and investment portfolio repricing and remixing that we think will be very beneficial to us. Then the funding component will have some market components as I mentioned.\nSo those are kind of the highlights of that page. We just wanted to provide a path of how we're thinking about net interest margin go forward.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nNo, I get that. But you know, and I get that it's, you know, unclear or you don't want to give a net interest specific net interest income figure for 27. But you know, we have the NIM. You're giving a NIM figure and you're giving an asset figure. So you know, you can multiply one by the other and you know extrapolate. So you know, and it does seem to be suggesting a much higher figure than where the street is at in terms of net interest income.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, I mean, again, it's based on our internal view of how we believe that the net interest income will evolve given the assets that we have on the balance sheet, how those will reprice over time, and how our deposit optimization can work over time. Again, we assume an upward sloping curve here, and some of the projections we talked about Investor Day. Those apply to this. So those are some of the factors that we have to consider. It creates a wide range of change. But we wanted to provide you at least the path of how we think about it within our modeling.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nOkay, that's helpful. I'll open the floor. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Vivek Juneja from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. A couple of questions. Firstly, merchant processing and corporate trust. What percentage of the revenues are in Europe?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, on the merchant side it's about 1/3 of the revenues. As it relates to that, on the trust and fund services it's even smaller than that, that it's probably sub 10% I would say.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nDifferent topic. Gunjan, your thoughts on this? You've talked about the Edward Jones partnership and driving growth through that. There was an article that I saw about Edward Jones actually submitting an application to set up their own bank and wanting to grow their own deposit program. Could you talk a little bit about how that would work with your partnership?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning, Vivek. So we are very aware of their plans and we have been all through our discussions around our partnership. What they are trying to do with their own bank application is a very limited scope for CD-like savings products. But the big bulk of banking capability that combines with their financial advice and brokerage capabilities is going to come from us. So this was very well contemplated through our discussions. Not a surprise to us.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Lastly, just in the cleanup thing for you, John, other income.\nYou'd guided previously to $125-150 million. Is that still the normal run rate given the upside you had this quarter?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, I think that we'll be on the high end of that range as we think about that going forward. Some more in the 150 area is kind of how I think about that for the foreseeable future.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Matt.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. I want to follow up on the new credit card. The 0% for two years, and often there's an upfront drag as you kind of ramp up those loans, and then obviously the payback on the other side. But anything that we should be modeling for that as we think about kind of upfront next several quarters.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nCEO and President, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMatt, the concept is very appropriate. There is an investment into building out the pipeline. We manage that quite carefully so that it does not change the overall dynamics of the fee growth, and it's a consistent inching up of the organic growth to create momentum going forward. So we would not expect it to show up in your modeling in any meaningful way. But it does create pipeline line strength 18 to 24 months out.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay.\nIt's a little bit of a lead into my follow-up question on the net interest income guide for Q2, I think ex day count. If you take the midpoint, it's relatively flat, and I guess, I don't know, why not grow a little bit as we think about progressing throughout the year starting in Q2.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, sure, Matt. So I think just given the environment and how things have evolved, we wanted to provide a little bit more of a wider range. We do expect net interest income to grow. Obviously there is one more day. So that's about $20 million or so for Q2. Excluding that we do expect growth. But we, you know, it's a volatile market and we wanted to. There is uncertainty, I should say, in the marketplace and we want to reflect that.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, I turn the call back over to you.\n\nGeorge Anderson\n\nDirector of Investor Relations for, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you. To everyone who joined our call this morning, please contact the investor relations department if you have any follow up questions. You may now disconnect the call. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Thank you.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the U.S. Bancorp Q4 2024 earnings conference call. Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one on your phone. If you wish to withdraw your question, please press star, then one again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Audra, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Andy Cecere; President, Gunjan Kedia; Vice Chair and CIO, Terry Dolan; and Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, John Stern. In a moment, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation together with their prepared remarks.\nA copy of the presentation, our press release, and all supplemental consolidated schedules can be found on our website at irr.usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's earnings release, our press release, and in reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will be happy to take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. In the fourth quarter, we reported a $1.01 per diluted share, or a $1.07 after adjusting for notable items. John will discuss these one-time charges in his prepared remarks.\nNet revenue totaled $7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for the year, as we saw both sequential and year-over-year quarterly growth in net interest income and non-interest income driven by effective balance sheet management, earning asset repricing and mix, and our highly diversified fee business offerings. Overall, the quarter was highlighted by top-line revenue growth and continued expense discipline, which resulted in 190 basis points of positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Turning to slide four, we had slight balance sheet growth this quarter, with average earning assets increasing 1.2%, driven by higher on-balance sheet liquidity. This quarter, we had modest loan loss reserve release, largely reflective of improved credit quality and a more favorable portfolio mix. On the bottom right of the slide, you can see that our CET1 capital ratio increased 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.6%.\nOur tangible book value per share totaled $24.63 at 31 December, an increase of 10.4% compared to the end of last year. During the quarter, we effectively balanced continued capital accretion with an initial $100 million of share repurchases. Slide five provides key performance metrics. On an adjusted basis, we delivered an 18.3% return on tangible common equity and an improved efficiency ratio of 59.9% in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide six, fee income represented over 40% of total net revenue in the fourth quarter. Results this quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year fee growth in commercial products, trust and investment management, and investment product revenues. Slide seven highlights a few of our key selected initiatives on interconnectedness across the franchise. Let me now turn over the call to John, who will provide more detail in the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy.\nIf you turn to slide eight, I'll start with a more detailed earnings summary followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings for diluted common share of $1.01, which included $109 million of notable expense items, or $82 million net of tax. Notable items for the quarter included $60 million related to operational efficiency initiatives and $49 million from lease impairments associated with strategic real estate restructuring actions. After adjusting for these notable items, we delivered diluted earnings per common share of $1.07 this quarter. Slide nine provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits increased 0.7% on a linked-quarter basis to $512 billion, as we continued to prioritize relationship-based deposits and maintained our pricing discipline. While total non-interest-bearing deposits increased slightly this quarter, this was largely driven by institutional deposit seasonality at the end of the quarter.\nImportantly, after accounting for this seasonality, our percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits now looks to have stabilized in line with our earlier expectations. Average loans totaled $376 billion, a modest increase of 0.4% on a linked quarter basis, driven by commercial lending initiatives, slower paydowns, and new originations in residential mortgages, as well as higher seasonal credit card spend. At 31 December, the ending balance on our investment portfolio increased slightly to $171 billion from opportunistic repurchases of securities. This quarter, we saw a slight decline in the average yield across both our investment portfolio and loan book as the impact of variable rates more than offset the benefits of fixed asset repricing. Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.18 billion, which was stable to Q3.\nFor the year, total net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was slightly better than our earlier guidance of $16.4 billion. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Linked quarter, we saw non-interest income growth in the trust and investment management, and other revenue that was partially offset by lower mortgage banking, and seasonally lower payments revenue. Importantly, excluding securities losses, full-year non-interest income increased 3.9% compared to 2023, consistent with our 2024 guidance, as we benefited from continued growth across our diversified and differentiated business mix. Turning to slide 12, non-interest expense for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion as adjusted. For the year, total non-interest expense was $16.79 billion as adjusted, which was just below or better than our full-year guidance of $16.8 billion. We remained focused on prudent expense management and continued to benefit from operational efficiencies across the company.\nSlide 13 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics this quarter were in line with expectations and reflected ongoing macroeconomic stability. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.48% at 31 December, compared with 0.49% at 30 September and 0.40% a year ago. The fourth quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.60% was flat to the third quarter, as expected, and our allowance for credit losses totaled $7.9 billion, or 2.09% of period-end loans at 31 December. Turning to slide 14, our CET1 capital ratio of 10.6% as of 31 December increased 10 basis points net of distributions, which included an initial $100 million of share buybacks this quarter. Moving forward, we expect the level and pace of buybacks to remain modest in the near term as we balance continued capital accretion with distributions.\nI will now provide Q1 and full-year 2025 forward-looking guidance on slide 15. Starting with the Q1 2025 guidance, net interest income is expected to be relatively stable to the Q4 of 2024, excluding the impact of fewer days. As a reminder, the Q1 has two fewer days than the Q4. Total non-interest expense is expected to be relatively stable to the Q4 level of approximately $4.2 billion as adjusted. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the Q1 of 200 basis points or more on a year-over-year basis. I'll now provide full-year 2025 guidance. Total revenue growth on an adjusted basis is estimated to be in the range of 3% to 5% compared to the full-year 2024.\nWe expect to achieve positive operating leverage, excluding the impact of security gains or losses, of greater than 200 basis points for the full year. I'll now hand it back over to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John. 2024 was a pivotal year for the company in many ways, and it marked a very important inflection point in our story. Going into the year, there was much uncertainty with respect to the broader macroeconomic environment, persistent inflation, significant rate volatility, political and regulatory headwinds, to name a few. But we effectively managed through the changes and, most importantly, executed on our strategic objectives. Fourth quarter results showcase our commitment to execution, which was highlighted by our delivery of 190 basis points of positive operating leverage.\nAs credit quality continued to stabilize and we prudently managed our capital position, it was effective balance sheet management, our financial discipline, and expanding interconnectedness across the franchise that enabled us to fully deliver the strong results we did this quarter and fully expect that momentum to continue into 2025. Finally, I'd like to extend our thoughts to those impacted by the devastating and ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles. We are closely monitoring the situation and have teams across the bank involved in our collective response efforts to help best support our employees, customers, and their communities. Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to our clients, communities, and shareholders, and what was a meaningful year for the company. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind you, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll go first to Scott Sefers at Piper Sandler.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Good morning, John. Hey, John, I was hoping maybe you could delve in a little more to discuss the drivers of the 3% to 5% expected full-year 2025 revenue growth. In other words, sort of how much comes from NII, how much ends up coming from fees. Then I guess a little clarification. When you're talking about the Q1 NII guide, I think you're saying flat, excluding the day count difference. I just want to be certain we're thinking it would be down on a reported basis marginally just due to fewer days.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nRight. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. So let me take your last question first. Yes, excluding days, about $40 million would be lower on a reported basis, so stable, excluding those two days of that $40 million. That's how we're representing that. On the drivers, on the 3% to 5% revenue growth, let me start with fees, and then I'll go over into net interest income. We had really solid and healthy growth on the fee side of things, and we have a lot of momentum building. That's despite some headwinds that we saw, particularly on our prepaid, on the card side of things, as well as freight, so some areas in the payments space that saw some headwinds. We also saw headwinds with the ATM exit of our cash servicing business. So those things will abate or have abated here in 2024.\nAnd so we see, obviously, momentum in the core. At Investor Day, we talked about our expectation for the medium term for our expectations for 2026 and 2027 to be at mid-single digits for fee growth. And that's a reasonable range for us to really think about as we think about 2025. And it really comes down to core areas of growth within our trust area. We're seeing strong market share, fund formation. The macro is really strong there. Payments, we have good momentum in a number of areas, strategic initiatives that are underway. Treasury management and capital markets continue to have strong growth in certain areas. A couple of areas that we're watching is mortgage. Mortgage is, with these higher rates, it's hard to see volumes really persist or be a lot stronger than it was in the prior year, and gain on sales is pretty stable as well.\nAnd then our other revenue will continue to be in that $125 to $150 million range on an average basis per quarter. So put another way, we expect fees to grow. We have strong momentum, and we think that mid-single digit is a reasonable place for us to begin. As we think about net interest income, again, well-positioned, the balance sheet's in a great spot. We saw inflection in our throughout 2024. And we really think about three key drivers for net interest income. It's going to come from better asset mix, which we've seen more of a shift into higher returning assets. That shift will continue. We've seen deposit normalization. That's the non-interest-bearing rotation is starting to slow down and really stabilize at this level. And then, importantly, fixed asset repricing on our backbook is going to be a meaningful driver this year, particularly with the curve steepening.\nWe've seen, since we were last on this call, the curve. And I always look at SOFR versus five-year Treasury. That was meaningfully inverted back in September, and now we're positive, actually. And so we think the backbook is going to give us some nice trajectory. Just as an example, we have about $3 billion of an investment portfolio that reprices per quarter of $3 billion that runs off that can get replaced at 150 to 200 basis points of spread. And then on the other fixed-rate assets that we have, which includes residential mortgage, commercial loans, and auto loans, and things like that, we have $5 to $7 billion on average that reprice, again, at that 150 to 200 basis points mark. And that's assuming kind of today's rates. So either way, we're very confident in our growth, both on fees and in net interest income.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAnd you put it all together, and that's really where we come up with our 3% to 5% total revenue growth. Perfect. All right, good. Appreciate all the details, John. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to John McDonald at Truist Securities.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning. Good.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey, guys. I wanted to ask two strategic questions. Maybe the first one is for Gunjan. Just on payments, you reorganized the business yesterday, or this week you announced a new head to the consumer side. Maybe just kind of give us the plan for payments and what you hope the new organization and setup will do for the growth and opportunities there.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning, John. Let me just remind you of some of the facts that we shared last time.\nOur payments franchise is a very strategic asset for us, and our sense is that we can do more to interconnect that product set with our consumer franchise and our institutional franchise. So the OAK structure and splitting it into the two pieces that are more aligned with the two parts of the franchise is an expectation to accelerate execution. So it's not really a strategic focus. We are very pleased to welcome two very high-quality leaders. Mark Runkel, we announced earlier. Earlier in the year, he stepped into his role on the institutional side, and Courtney Kelso joins us from AMEX next month. So that was sort of the intention, and the goal is to truly accelerate our execution around our vision for interconnectedness.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Yeah, thanks, Gunjan. And Andy, maybe broader, just kind of where have you planted seeds for offense across the company?\nI think in the retail bank, you're looking in the Union Bank franchise and maybe through your partners, Edward Jones, and State Farm. But maybe just across the footprint, where are you excited about where U.S. Bank has kind of invested for growth and you might be moving to the front foot?\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. I think it's across all of our business lines, and it's that concept that we talked about in Investor Day, which is about interconnectedness. But if you think about the momentum that John articulated and Gunjan talked about, our payments business, our trust and investment management business, our commercial products business, our retail business, the growth and deposit activity, our commercial business with the growth and targeted loan activity, profitable loans. So we really have a lot of momentum going.\nAnd that, John, couple that with sort of the headwind that was the yield curve that John talked about, I think drives to positive momentum on net interest income. The fee categories we talked about, which I all think have positive momentum, and all of that is coupled with a relatively flat expense for the last five quarters, which drives to this positive operating leverage that we talked about. So across all the categories of revenue, it's positive. Expense is well-managed, and that's going to deliver the positive operating leverage.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Betsy.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHi, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI noticed that mine sounds very ticky-tacky, but I just want to make sure I understand what forward curve your NII guide is based on.\nAnd I think you mentioned today, but the reason I ask is, as we all know, the forward curve has changed a lot between beginning of December and today. So that's the first question.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So in terms of our curve, we do have two rate cut assumptions embedded. I think one's in May and one's in September. So that's kind of how we think about the short end of the curve. And the long end of the curve is at this level. So right now, the 10-year Treasury is at 4.65. That's probably a good place. That's kind of where we're at kind of throughout the year. Of course, we know that it's volatile. It's been volatile. And that's why I say the curve does matter when we kind of look at these sorts of things. But those are our projections.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great.\nCan you help us understand how your projections would move in the event that you got fewer rate cuts or the long end went up more? That's kind of the idea.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nExactly. So again, we have continued to be neutral from an interest rate risk standpoint. So as I mentioned, we expect two cuts. But if those cuts don't manifest or the Fed even hikes or there's more cuts, which we know the cycles, right, things will shift. We want to be as neutral as possible to those particular movements from the Fed on the short end of the curve. Where there can be some change is really on the shape of the curve. So a steeper curve, the better off we are. If it's more inverted, then that would put a little bit more pressure on the net interest income.\nSo at a high level, those are kind of the puts and takes.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd as we roll through the year, can you just give us a sense as to that fixed asset repricing? Is it coming through kind of quarterly cadence the same, or is there any acceleration or deceleration during the year that we should be thinking about?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nIt's pretty consistent. So I mentioned the $5 to 7 billion per quarter. I mean, it's going to range in that corridor each quarter, but it doesn't accelerate. It doesn't tail off. It's pretty consistent throughout the course of the year. Same on the investment portfolio, pretty consistent.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you so much.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Abraham Punawalla with Bank of America.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nSorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks.\nWhen we think about the NII guidance for the year or your revenue outlook, what's underpinning that from a loan growth perspective? So yeah, what's the assumption on loan and deposit growth? And are we seeing any green shoots of a pickup in lending demand?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Abraham. So we did not comment yet on loans, but I would just say in terms for purposes of our forecast and how we're thinking about 2025, we have pretty modest loan and deposit growth for the full year. Now, in terms of sentiment and things of that variety, clearly there's a lot of positivity. Our client base is excited. I think there's a lot of momentum clearly in our pipelines that we can see has not yet translated into elevated loan growth at this point. But perhaps that changes.\nWe're thinking, hopefully, in the back half of the year, we can see that pickup in loan growth. But in terms of our forecasts and our projections, we anticipate modest for the year.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. And I guess maybe just talk about I think you addressed a little bit around the payments business as we think about the fee revenue sort of categories across payments. If you can sort of drill into expectations around that year-over-year in context of your overall revenue guide. And obviously, you brought in a new head of payments yesterday. Remind us of the market positioning. Are we winning share, losing market share, and what the ambition is there going forward? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So as I mentioned in payments earlier, we have momentum on the core side. We had had some headwinds there. So if I just kind of go through the different categories.\nOn the card side of things, we had strong sales on the credit card side, just over nearly 6%, really. Total revenue was hurt in prepaid this quarter by about 4 percentage points given the exiting of some of our prepaid revenue. That's going to impact us again in Q1, but then we'll fully lap that in Q2. Continuing in the card side, we anticipate growth there, and we have a lot of momentum in different products. We have our Smartly card that is coming online. We have a lot of excitement around that, our Union acquisition, increasing that penetration. We continue to expect that mid-single digit growth in terms of on a retail card side of things. On the merchant side of things, we've had, again, strong sales. Our tech-led formation and growth there has been really strong. We've been making investments.\nWe expect travel to improve, same-store sales to improve. Clearly, our growth rate in 2024 was below our expectations. As we see a lot more high volume, lower margin type clients continuing their pace, we're looking at the growth rate as better than, of course, 2024, but it may not be at our aspiration of high single digits for 2025. Then on the CPS side of things, strong quarterly growth that we had. They had their best year. We've been making a lot of investments there. The pipelines are strong. Freight, we've lapped. So a lot of positive things there. Again, the union penetration is going to be really paying off for us as well. So we see high single digits there as well.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Erika Najarian at UBS.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYes, good morning.\nYou did announce that $5 billion share repurchase authorization during Investor Day, and I think the market got quite excited about that. In terms of the pacing of the buybacks, you did $100 million this quarter. I guess I heard you guys loud and clear during the prepared remarks, but what are the puts and takes that you're considering in terms of thinking about that pacing? I know that you're looking for a modest pace to begin with, but if loan growth is a little soft and it seems like you have conservative guidance embedded in your revenue guide for balance sheet growth, what are the puts and takes in terms of the more modest start to buybacks?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. At a high level, Erika, it's really the balance between growing our capital to get to where we need to be from a Category II perspective.\nWe talked about 10% being our approximate level of where we want to be on a Category II basis. And obviously, we don't expect to be a Category II bank until 2027 or thereabouts. So that's really the one side of it. The other side is, as you said, loan growth. If it's weaker, then there's an opportunity for deployment. But we just started. We're stepping into this, and we talked about the next quarter and the pace thereafter is just going to be dictated on those factors that I just mentioned.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nJust as a follow-up here, and maybe this is for Andy, the way you laid out your projection on slide 15 in terms of the revenue guide and then positive operating leverage, if net interest income or payments swing one way or the other, either to the better or maybe softer, is the message here that you're now to a point where there's enough flex where, regardless of the revenue environment, that 200-plus basis points is going to be sort of the baseline for what you can deliver in 2025?\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nShort answer, Erika, is yes. It's 200 basis points plus on positive operating leverage. We do have flex on expense. I'm going to ask John to highlight some of the areas. But we've been managing to a flat expense base for a number of quarters. This is our fifth quarter of the flat expenses.\nWe're still investing in the company, but we're managing across many different areas. We are very confident in that positive operating leverage regardless of what the revenue environment is. And John, why don't you talk about some of the levers?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Clearly, we've done a lot of work on the expense. We're very proud of the efforts that the teams have made thus far. We have continued to see different levers that we're looking at and will kind of throughout the year kind of talk more about. Obviously, we had a notable item on the real estate side of things. There's continued to be optimization there, procurement, and third-party spend actions. We see opportunity as well as organizational simplicity, bringing fragmented groups together, and centralizing certain aspects. And then just automation of processes.\nWe have a lot of the investments that we've been talking about over at Investor Day help us manage that expense by automating certain processes. And then that inflection point that we talked about in terms of investment in our digital capabilities. So the stabilization of that digital investment, we've increased that amount all along that J curve, if you will. And now we're at a flat place, and we're bending that cost curve on the digital side, which we're really excited about. So those are kind of the main pieces. There's others. We have a lot of different initiatives, but those are the different levers that we look at.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Erika.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John Pancari at Evercore ISI.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, John.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning. Just appreciate the breakout of the revenue growth outlook by fees and then your commentary around net interest income.\nJust behind that net interest income commentary and some of the drivers you mentioned around fixed asset repricing and deposit normalization, can you give us maybe your thoughts around the net interest margin trajectory as we look through the year? And perhaps maybe even help us with where the margin could end up as an exit rate coming out of 2025, just to help give us a better color around what it means for the medium-term trends. Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, John. And we anticipate, given the drivers, we do anticipate net interest margin to follow net interest income and increase. We certainly, from a management standpoint, we don't manage to net interest margin. As an example, this quarter, it fell three basis points entirely due to liquidity, right? So I mean, there's always going to be transitional puts and takes to it. But directionally, it should follow.\nWe talked about, at Investor Day, about how not that there's anything magical about 3%, but I mean, there's certainly a lot of momentum in all those categories and drivers that I just mentioned really to kind of get us into that level over time. I think the big things that can move it are really loan growth as that goes up and down, deposit management, and then the shape of the curve, which impacts our fixed asset or our backbook repricing. So those are going to be the components, but certainly expect directionally the net interest margin to improve as we march through time.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. All right, John. Thank you for that. And then separately back to capital.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nOn the M&A front, I know, post the Investor Day, you've been clear that that whole bank M&A would only be more of a consideration longer term as you look at your franchise versus a near-term opportunity. I guess, Andy, has that or Gunjan, has that changed at all? Or, just given the election results and how comprehensively we expect a regulatory supervisory role change across the different regulators, and then, does it? I guess another question would be, what would change your view in terms of possibly putting M&A options more in the near-term view?Thanks.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo John, our perspective is the same, which is it's not a priority for us right now. The combination of the purchase accounting marks, the regulatory approval process, which may improve, but isn't clear yet, and the current bank valuations all factor into this.\nSo while it may return, large bank M&A may return over the longer term. We're very focused on our organic growth opportunities because we have a lot of them. And that's where we're putting our efforts and priorities right now. And Gunjan, maybe you can highlight a couple of them because I think that emphasis is because of the opportunities that we have in front of us.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident, U.S. Bancorp\n\nVery true. Good morning, John. I'll add that while the regulatory environment is very attractive for our organic growth opportunities too, we saw a very significant acceleration of our trust and investment fees, and our capital markets fees because investor confidence and consumer confidence is very high. So the ability to drive a real inflection in organic growth with positive operating leverage is very much our focus. And it's across many, many parts of our business.\nOn the product side, we have a balance sheet that would support a much bigger capital markets business. So we are very focused on that. We're introducing new capabilities there at quite a good pace. And the interconnectivity across our product sets is really deepening the franchise as well. So it's a very good strategy to drive growth with positive operating leverage, and that is our focus right now.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, great. Thank you, Gunjan.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Mike. Hi, Erika. How are you?\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nFinally turning the corner on positive operating leverage. You said at least 200 basis points. I think after so long not having positive operating leverage, I think people are wondering. It's kind of a show-me story. I think you might understand that.\nUnder what scenario do you think you could have more than the 200 basis points guide? Some other banks are actually guiding higher today, and you have a lot of tailwinds in the industry. So how high could that go? Because the stock's down, people are questioning this. What would be your reaction?\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMike, what we wanted to do is to provide a guide that we have confidence in and that we're conservatively giving you numbers. I'm very confident in our ability to manage expense in this environment, and I'm very confident in the inflection point on the revenue components. And that's why we put a 200 basis points plus on that guide. So we'll hit 200 at least. But to the extent that the market helps us on the revenue side with the yield curve and the things that John talked about, I expect it to be above that.\nBut we want to give you a guide and an expectation that we're very comfortable with, and that we take into account the different puts and takes that are a little bit out of our control, like yield curve.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAnd then a more specific question. The merchant acquiring yield looked like it contracted 70 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter, and the revenues didn't accelerate with the volumes. Was that expected? Was that a surprise? Is there competitive pressure? What's causing that 70 basis point contraction in the merchant acquiring yield? Thanks. Sure.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo, Mike, I think I mentioned, although it was pretty quick when I mentioned that our client base, while we had strong growth in terms of same-store sales and tech-led initiatives, which are the tech-led has strong margins, and it continues to be about 1/3 and has been growing 1/3 of our total business on the merchant side. The growth on the other side of our client base has been in higher volume, lower margin, and that has persisted kind of throughout the year. And that's kind of creating that disconnect that you just mentioned. And kind of talked about the expectations that we have here in 2025 is kind of followed because of that.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI can add some color here, John, if I may. We were disappointed in the merchant results for this quarter as well, but the business is really showing two very different characteristics.\nThere's the part that we are very proud of, which is the tech-led part, about 1/3 of the business now. The value proposition to the customer and the client across our franchise is very strong there. We see very nice growth rates there. Talech and Salucro were two acquisitions we did around the retail space and the healthcare space. So that part, you see revenue and sales volumes show good patterns. On the other side, we have a very vast group of partners, and we just saw growth in a few very large volume, low-margin businesses. Some of that might persist on that side of the business, but that was the quarter here.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the trends in commercial products revenue.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nIt was up nicely year to year, but was a little bit lower versus kind of the run rate you've seen the other quarters this year. Just remind us, I think there's a decent contributor of capital markets in that, and remind us what the drivers of the underlying businesses are.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So this is the commercial products, Matt, is what I heard you say. So yeah, we had strong growth in commercial products. It's been a good story for us. We've highlighted it, of course, at various investor conferences, obviously at Investor Day and then in a fourth-quarter conference as well. So we've talked quite a bit about it. But the growth really came in a lot of different areas here this quarter. It was in client-related derivative activity, which were either interest rate swaps or foreign exchange. Loan syndication was up as well, bond underwriting.\nAnd we're seeing the new products also kick in. So we've talked about some of our other ABS desks, syndication desks, and commodities and things like that. And so that's about 20% of our growth this year was really on the new product side. And the verticals, interconnectedness we have with the private credit side of things really help us focus in on that growth. And we expect, and we've talked about our expectations with that, and nothing has really changed. We have high expectations for this business.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then separately on the deposits, the average deposits grew. And I know there's some seasonality on the period end, but they were down a little bit this quarter for the third quarter in a row. So maybe I just answered the question that there's too much seasonality and really focused on period end, but maybe just address that.\nAnd I think you did say you expect modest deposit growth. So just anything to add to the narrative though that the period end was lower?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Yeah. So for us, as we've talked about, the average balance is a better indicator than ending. The ending can really fluctuate. We can get some pretty meaningful movements at the end of quarters. Particularly in the third quarter was very strong from a deposit growth standpoint. And so even though we had a pretty big surge of deposits at the end of the fourth quarter, it was compared to a really high third quarter. So that's just kind of one example.\nIn the first quarter, part of the reason we talk about a stable net interest income for the first quarter is in the first quarter, deposits seasonally decline, particularly in our institutional and wholesale side of things in DDA as an example. Just because if you think about our operational accounts that we have there, there's a lot of either deployment of investments from our institutional clients or just overall investment from our corporate-related clients. And so that's kind of a driver of Q1 from a deposit standpoint. But overall, you should think about deposits being a modest growth, consistent with the industry, those sorts of things. That's kind of how I characterize it.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. We'll go next to David Long at Raymond James.\n\nDavid Long\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\n\nDavid Long\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nJust wanted to stick with the deposit theme here. When I look at your average cost, deposit cost for the quarter, it came down in line with what I'm seeing with some of your peers. Just curious what you're seeing in the competition for deposits and pricing, and how do you think that plays out throughout 2025?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, David. From a deposit standpoint, and this is again embedded in our growth projections and things like that of modest growth and deposits, I do expect it to be kind of equal in terms of either whether it's on the consumer side or on the institutional side. If I kind of break those two pieces apart, on the consumer side, it seems like things have been. It's kind of either it comes and goes in terms of competitive nature.\nI would say more lately with the rate cuts that have occurred, that's loosened things up. And so we're seeing a little bit better in terms of pricing competitively. It may not show up immediately this quarter, but over time, we would expect the retail competitiveness to moderate. On the institutional side, that also kind of comes and goes, but I would call it pretty standard at this point. I think the one negative or headwind right now is QT. That's been drying up liquidity, and that can create some competitive natures on the institutional side. But all in all, we expect to be obviously very competitive out there. We have a lot of new great products that are helping us grow deposits, and we feel very strongly about that. And those are kind of the main puts and takes.\n\nDavid Long\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nExcellent. Thanks, John. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nHi. Thanks. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, Andy. So a strategic question. Payments, there's been discussion about that already. It's a question we've talked on previous calls. I heard Gunjan's response, \"The tech-led's doing well, but the rest has gotten used to drag.\" That probably caught nuance into next year. Given the business, given the pricing pressures, have you considered whether you should get rid of this business and deploy the capital to other areas where you're doing a much where you're in a much stronger position, getting better returns? Why wouldn't you think of that?\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI'll start with that and ask Gunjan to add on. But I think in this environment, this interconnectedness of banking and payments is as important as it's ever been.\nThe concept of moving money together with storing money and lending money is all intertwined. To the extent we can offer these things together with a terrific technology platform that we have and also have the ability to grow that in a very capital-efficient, fee-focused way is why we want to retain the business. The interconnectedness of that is as critical as it's been in the last 20 years. So we're very focused on this business because of that opportunity. Gunjan wants you to add on.\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident, U.S. Bancorp\n\nVivek, good morning. It's a thoughtful question. I'll add to what Andy is saying here. First, just, we are talking about deltas to expectations, but the business has very high returns. It's a very attractive business. It is an area where a lot of competitive set has been building market share.\nWe are seeing more discipline come into this industry, just focus on profitability, focus on return on investments rather than just market share gains. If you look long-term, it is the one product where we have frequent, deep, and embedded interactions with our clients. It anchors the client value proposition and the client retention in a way that is very hard to do from some of the banking and some of the more sort of routine products. So we have deep conviction that money movement needs to be at the center of a financial relationship with our clients surrounded by banking capabilities. I also just remind you of the size of just the various parts of our payments business. It's 25% of our total revenue. 2/3 of that is our core credit card issuing business, very healthy, very steady market shares there.\nOur corporate payment and card issuing business is also looking at very healthy pipelines. All of this gives us great capacity to stay with the Elavon business and build it out both for the small business and for the corporate areas. So to answer your question, it's a good question. And strategically, you want this capability in the mix with your clients.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Vivek.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Bill Carcache at Wolfe Research.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Bill.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Your tech-led merchant processing service revenue growth seems solid at a time there's still a perception that you're at a disadvantage to some of your fintech competitors. Can you take us inside of that 9% growth and discuss the breakdown between new additions versus customer attrition?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning, Bill. Let me just start here. So the competition on the tech-led comes in two ways.\nOne is the user experience on the front end. What we do with our partners here in the tech-led space is provide the reliability, the operations. It's not easy to be the backend partner of a unique value proposition in the front. So it's fraud monitoring, it's transaction monitoring, it's reliability of systems, it's all of the networks that go into it. This is a very good partnership as much as it is competition with other areas. It's a matter of where you're playing a role. We do expect that to be a really strong contributor to the growth rate of this business. As time goes by, it'll take over more and more of the total franchise. To your question around sort of the new business versus now, it's a very dynamic space.\nI mean, we have a vast number of partnerships, and their success in the front end can shift that mix a little bit. So it's really the portfolio that we manage to.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Separately, following up on your NIM commentary, I may have missed this, but where did deposit funding costs end the quarter, and where would you expect the average cost to grow from here given your rate expectations?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So from a deposit cost standpoint, maybe I'll speak to it in beta terms because I think it's just easier to utilize that because obviously we're going to see a little bit of impact next quarter with the Fed moves that we saw. And the fourth quarter will impact the first quarter. So our cumulative beta throughout the fourth quarter was 38%.\nWe anticipate our beta to be at kind of the mid to high 40s as we look at Q1 results. And so you'll see that decline on the deposit rate as we move forward.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. If I could squeeze in one last one, can you discuss how much cash flow and fair value hedge notional is active, I guess how that exposure changes as we progress through the year, and any color on pay versus receive rates for both?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nOh, sure. So this quarter is actually a really good example of our hedging program at work and why it's working as intended. We have pay-fixed swaps, and we have receive-fixed swaps. The pay-fixed swaps are intended to help protect capital when interest rates rise. They did rise. We saw 80 basis points upward movement.\nOur AOCI number did increase, but not nearly the magnitude that perhaps others and things of that variety. And that helps us manage that Category II capital level that I spoke to. Obviously, with pay-fixed swaps, that's going to create a little bit of a drag on NII. However, offsetting that was our receive-fixed swaps that were attached to either commercial loans or debt. And those receive-fixed swaps increased our rate relative to where they would have been otherwise. And so you can think of those as largely offsetting. So from an income standpoint, the hedges are relatively neutral.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you for taking my questions.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our final question from Saul Martinez at HSBC.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nHey, good morning, guys. I think Vivek asked my question, but I'll maybe ask it another way.\nI guess I'm struggling to see how you differentiate yourself in the merchant acquired business. With the exception of maybe Chase, most banks have lost share over the years. There's an enormous amount of innovation in that space, a lot of capital in that space. You've seen a shift in power to software providers, and legacy merchant acquires have lost share over the years. I guess what I was going to ask you is whether you can make an argument that it's worth more to somebody else than to you. And I guess the answer to that question from your answer to Vivek's question is that it does provide value to the entire franchise, to the entire business. Is that the answer? And I guess the adjunct to that question is, how do you measure success in the acquired business?\nAre you looking at just volume growth, revenue growth, or are there other measures? How do you measure whether this business is, you're succeeding in your strategy here and this business is adding value to the entire franchise?\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp",
    "content2": "So, Saul, I'm going to start and then ask Gunjan to add on. This is Andy. I'm going to start by reiterating what I said before, which is this interconnectedness of banking, money movement, and payments. And we've made investments in categories and verticals that are very focused on capabilities to provide information and help those businesses run their platform and their business, like healthcare and some of the other areas that we're focused on. So what's happened in payments and money movement has become more embedded in the banking component.\nI think that's our advantage versus a pure play merchant provider, is interlocking those components to help them run their business. We've focused in certain verticals that are, I think, very important in terms of our overall growth opportunities. In terms of what we're looking for, it's all those things. It's top-line revenue growth, but importantly, bottom-line profitable revenue growth. The progress we've made in the tech-led, the interconnected components that we've talked about in terms of those verticals we're focused on are all indications that we're headed in the right directions. We're not where we want to be yet, but we're heading the right way. Gunjan, what would you add?\n\nGunjan Kedia\n\nPresident, U.S. Bancorp\n\nAt the power of the distribution franchise, we have 15 million clients.\nIf you look at standalone players that bring a very high level of innovation, as you called it, to the table, their gap is the client franchise. That's where the partnerships come with some of the innovation in the industry. Saul, it's a lot of infrastructure and investment to connect the transaction and the provision of the services beyond the user experience and the innovation in the front. So we see very significant demand for a partnership with us. But the model has to transform in the direction that we are going, where we need to be able to provide, connect, and have a very easy onboarding experience, very easy, quick ability to bring merchants on and off. That's all of the investments that we have been making.\nSo it's the distribution side, and it's all of the backend product capabilities that give us the competitive edge here.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nOkay. That's helpful. I guess just a quick follow-up then on deposits, John. I guess we're closer to the end of the rate-cutting cycle, although seemingly every day there's shifts in what the forward curve is expecting. But remind us what the through-the-cycle deposit beta you're expecting. I heard mid to 40s in Q1. I think high 40s, low 50s is what you've is that the right through-the-cycle beta?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThat's right. So we think about 38 is spot through the cycle as of this quarter. We expect mid to high 40s in the first quarter. And assuming there's additional cuts, we would migrate kind of in the through-the-cycle to that 50%. North of that level is kind of where our expectations are. Thank you.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time, Mr. Andersen. I'll turn the conference back over to you.\n\nAndrew Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Audra. Thank you to everyone who joined our call this morning. Please contact the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions. You may now disconnect the call. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one on your phone. If you wish to withdraw your question, please press star, then one again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 10:00AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Krista, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Andy Cecere; Vice Chair and CAO, Terry Dolan; and Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, John Stern. Together with their prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules can be found on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty.\nFactors that can materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, our press release, and in reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. In Q2, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.97, which included $0.01 per share of notable item related to the FDIC special assessment. Excluding this one-time charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98. This quarter was highlighted by an increase in net interest income, continued fee income growth, prudent expense management, credit quality stabilization, and strong capital accretion. Notably, our return on tangible common equity increased to 18.6% on an adjusted basis.\nTurning to slide four, revenue growth for the quarter was supported by improved spread income and as well as continued growth across many of our fee-based businesses. On both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, non-interest expense as adjusted was down, benefiting from cost synergies with Union Bank, prudent expense management, and multi-year investments across the business that have resulted in greater efficiencies and enhanced operating effectiveness. As I mentioned earlier, credit quality results were in line with our expectations as we saw stabilization in delinquency rates and a modest increase in NPAs.\nAverage total deposits increased 2.2%, and we continued to see growth in consumer deposits despite industry and liquidity headwinds. As of 30 June 2024, our tangible book value per share increased $23.15 to $23.15, or 2.8% better than last quarter and 10.1% higher than last year. Our CET1 capital ratio increased 30 basis points from the prior quarter and 120 basis points from last year to end the quarter at 10.3%. John will discuss some key takeaways from this year's stress test in his opening remarks.\nSlide five provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets increased to 0.98%, and return on average common equity improved to 12.6%. Our efficiency ratio also improved from Q1 to 60.7% on an adjusted basis. Turning to slide six, fee income represents just over 40% of total net revenue and benefited this quarter from high seasonal revenues across each of our payment businesses, strong co-growth and trust in investment management fees, as well as improved treasury management revenue. Overall, diversified fee income businesses continue to operate at scale and provide earnings consistency through the cycle.\nMost importantly, we are encouraged by the progress we're making to deepen our most profitable client relationships, expand our product set, and enhance our distribution channels. These efforts are positioning us well for continued growth and strategic differentiation. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. If you turn to slide seven, I'll start with a balance sheet summary followed by a discussion of Q2 earnings trends. Total average deposits increased $10.8 billion, or 2.2% on a linked-quarter basis, to $514 billion, driven by stable institutional deposit balances and continued consumer balance growth. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $1.4 billion, or 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis, as we continue to emphasize stickier relationship-based deposit generation. The pace of decline in non-interest-bearing balances continued to slow this quarter.\nAs the chart in the upper left shows, we are prudently managing our pricing as we remain focused on retaining and growing core operational relationships across the franchise. Average total loans were $375 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion, or 1.0% linked quarter. The increase was driven by higher credit card loans from higher spend volumes and increased commercial loans from growth in corporate banking. Loan growth this quarter was partially offset by lower commercial real estate and total other retail loans.\nWith elevated deposit levels, we opportunistically increased the size of our investment securities portfolio with short-dated high-quality securities to better optimize cash levels. As a result, the ending balance on our investment portfolio was $168 billion as of 30 June 2024. Actions taken on the investment portfolio this quarter, together with approximately $3 billion of securities runoff, resulted in an average yield increase to 3.15%, a 19 basis points increase from the prior quarter.\nGoing forward, we would expect the balance on the investment portfolio to remain relatively flat to the current level and for the reinvestment benefit from quarterly securities runoff to be approximately 6 to 8 basis points on average based on current rates. Slide eight highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with expectations, and we remain appropriately reserved for potential adverse economic conditions.\nIn Q2, delinquencies were flat sequentially. Non-performing assets increased approximately 3.7% linked quarter, reflecting a slower pace of change. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 49 basis points at 30 June 2024, compared with 48 basis points at 31 March 2024 and 29 basis points a year ago. Our Q2 net charge-off ratio of 58 basis points increased 5 basis points from Q1 in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect our net charge-off ratio to approach 60 basis points in the second half of this year. Our allowance for credit losses as of 30 June totaled $7.9 billion, or 2.1% of period-end loans.\nSlide nine provides a more detailed earnings summary. In Q2, we reported $0.97 per diluted share, which included $0.01 per share, or a $26 million charge for an increase in the FDIC special assessment following last year's bank failures. Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.05 billion, an increase of 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in net interest income this quarter was driven by a combination of deposit volume growth, pricing stabilization, and slower migration, as well as fixed asset repricing, improved loan mix, and other actions taken on the investment portfolio to optimize cash balances.\nElevated deposit levels and higher on-balance sheet liquidity drove a 3 basis points decline in net interest margin this quarter to 2.67%. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Fee income increased $115 million, or 4.3% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by seasonally higher payments revenue and stronger mortgage banking fees, which included an approximate $30 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. This increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in commercial product revenue due to lower corporate bond fees and losses on investment security sales of $36 million.\nNon-interest income through the first six months of the year increased 5.4% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to benefit from deepening client relationships across our fee businesses. Turning to slide 12, non-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $6 million, or 0.1% on a linked-quarter basis. The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and employee benefit expense, which was partially offset by higher net occupancy and equipment, as well as marketing and business development costs.\nYear-over-year, non-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $71 million, or 1.7%, as we prudently managed expenses, identified operational efficiencies across the business, and realized synergies from the Union Bank acquisition. Turning to slide 13, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3% as of 30 June 2024 was reflective of a 30-basis point increase from Q1 and a 120-basis point improvement compared to last year. On 26 June 2024, the Federal Reserve released its 2024 stress test results.\nConsistent with the industry, the Fed's model results were largely reflective of an assumption taken to significantly lower fee income and increase provision expense in stress, which resulted in a 60-basis point increase to our preliminary Stress Capital Buffer of 3.1%. We remain well capitalized and prepared to manage any potential industry stress that might result from a severe macroeconomic downturn.\nI will now provide forward-looking guidance on slide 14, which is consistent with our previous guidance. We expect net interest income for Q3 on an FTE basis to be relatively stable to Q2. Full year 2024 net interest income on an FTE basis is expected to be in the range of $16.1 to $16.4 billion. For the full year, we expect to achieve mid-single digit growth in non-interest income as adjusted. We continue to expect full year non-interest expense as adjusted of $16.8 billion or lower. Let me now turn it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John. I'll finish up on slide 15. Q2 results highlighted the resiliency of a business model that features a highly diversified revenue mix, strong risk management discipline, and a robust earnings and capital generation profile. We remain focused on our core competencies and are aggressively building upon our key differentiators. The investments we're making across the businesses are showing through in the form of enhanced customer acquisition, improved client experiences, and deeper relationships that are further propelling our growth story.\nExpense management is a key priority for us, and we remain focused on our target of positive operating leverage in the second half of this year and beyond. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue to build upon our solid foundation and already established interconnectedness across the business with the scale, reach, and product capabilities that allow us to deliver industry-leading returns well into the future. Let me close by thanking our employees for everything they do to make us the destination of choice for many clients, communities, and shareholders we serve. We'll now open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. For any additional questions, please re-queue. Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nJohn, hey. John, I was hoping you could please sort of discuss the puts and takes within the NII trajectory from here. It looks like we would hopefully get a bump in Q4 after a stable Q3 if we sort of assume the midpoint of the full year range. I guess maybe just a thought or two on factors that would cause you to come in either toward the high end or the low end of the full year range, please.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, Scott. Good morning. First of all, we're pleased to see our net interest income grow, and we like the actions that we've taken to position ourselves for the future. Deposit rotation and rates paid have stabilized. Loan mix has improved. Our fixed asset earning asset repricing continues to march on, and we've been opportunistically working with the investment portfolio to deploy excess liquidity. So if you think about some of these things going forward, the higher and lower end of the range, I'd cite a couple of different things. First of all, I would just say, as I mentioned, we expect stable Q3 net interest income, and then from there, we do expect growth.\nWe would anticipate that the pluses and minuses is going to be depending upon deposit rotation and beta. We do expect some level of rotation out of deposits going forward, but it's going to be relatively modest. As you can tell, it's slowed. In terms of rate pay, that's going to be dependent on the market, but as you can tell, that has slowed as well, and we feel good about our positioning for rate cuts as we move forward should they occur. Our earning assets, we know are going to be formulaic and continue to reprice, whether that's the investment portfolio or the mortgage book. We expect kind of in that 6 to 8 basis point range on average given current levels.\nThen loan growth, we assume to be very modest in our forecast kind of going forward, just kind of given the loan dynamics that we're seeing. And then finally, I would just say, although it's not as going to be meaningful for 2024, it's just the actions of the Fed and what they do, whether they cut or not. So those are kind of the puts and takes as we kind of think about the next couple of quarters.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you, John. And then maybe if I could ask you to delve a little more deeply into one portion of that. Just, you noted modest loan growth here going forward. What are you all seeing in terms of commercial loan demand? I guess I sort of asked within the backdrop of the modest outlook, but your average commercial loan growth this quarter looked a little more favorable than what we've seen from peers. So just curious as to sort of the insight based on that.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So I think on loan growth, we did see pockets of loan growth occur in the corporate loan book. But I think our overall thesis really hasn't changed over the last several quarters. The loan growth environment remains tepid. There's caution in the clients, but there's a lot of interest rate movement, and I'm sure that could spark some things. But overall, it's still a very tepid market. We just happen to find some pockets of growth on the corporate loan book this quarter.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Okay. Good. Thank you very much.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nI guess maybe, John, just following up on the NII. My math, your Q4 could be as high as $4.3 billion. So I appreciate the puts and takes you provided earlier. As we think about the NII trajectory from here in a rate cut scenario, just remind us in terms of the positioning of the balance sheet what four to six rate cuts would imply and flex on the deposit side given sort of your corporate institutional makeup.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Ebrahim. So the way I think about potential rate cut shift and change in market there is that we are well positioned given the mix of our deposit base. So approximately 50% of our balances are retail-based, and about 50% of our balances are institutional or corporate-type balances. And in a cut environment, those institutional corporate balances, the beta, if you will, of those are going to go down as quickly as they came up. So we feel very good about the repositioning of that. On the retail side, I would just say that there'll always be some arc to the retail, so there'll be probably some repricing that occurs at the still higher levels.\nBut over time, those balances will come down. And so overall, it gives us an advantage as the curve, in theory, should start to steepen, and you have a lower short-term rate and a higher longer-term rate that allows for continued earning asset favorability on the repricing side of things.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. I guess just separately, when we think about the outlook for the back half on fee revenue growth, the mid-single digits, where do you think fee revenue growth is going to be driven? What categories are going to drive that growth? Where do you expect some more moderation relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. I think on the fee side of things, we had a solid quarter, but we continue to expect momentum in the various categories. And it's going to be a combination of all the main ones. It's going to be payments. It's going to be our trust investment management fees, and it's going to be in the capital market space, is probably the three areas that I would point you to. On the payment side of things, we continue to see strong core competencies, whether in the merchant processing you're talking about or tech-led areas. If you're talking about our corporate payments side of things, you're looking at us starting to lap some of the things in freight and fleet.\nAnd on credit, credit card, we continue to see strong spend levels. So those are all going to be positive things for us as we move forward. The trust and investment management fees, as well as the capital markets, continue to see very strong market backdrop, and we have been doing very well in terms of investment in those businesses, as well as just utilizing our client base and deepening relationships there in a number of different facets. And then those are going to be kind of the tailwinds that we see that position us well for continuing our guidance here in terms of mid-single-digit growth for fees.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI know we already talked a little bit about the loan growth piece, but going through the slide deck, you highlighted that there's utilization rate increase. So I guess I'm just wondering, and it's important, right? Because at least you're the first institution I've seen this quarter that's had a utilization increase. Do you think that's a function of the types of industries where you're seeing utilization increase, or is that more your new geographies where perhaps more focused attention on new clients is driving that? I would just like to understand that.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Betsy. So in terms of utilization, it did tick up. I would say it's pretty modest, and I would say it's pretty much in line with where we've seen in the past. I wouldn't point to it as some new trend that we're going to see continued utilization investment or increase. I think it's really more of a function of the loan mix that we saw this quarter. Some of the loans that were brought on came at a high utilization level versus some of the things that rolled off. So I just think it's more of a mix shift rather than a change in trend.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks. And then just on the credit outlook here, I got a sense that maybe there was a little bit more credit coming through towards the back half of the year. Is that right, or did I get that wrong?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, I don't think our, well, first of all, our guidance really hasn't changed from a credit standpoint. It continues to be. It's stabilizing. It's as expected. From a net charge-off perspective, we came in at 58 basis points. We would anticipate approaching 60 basis points here in the back half of the year, is kind of how we're thinking about the charge-off. But things like delinquencies, and non-performing, those metrics have come in, have stabilized, and have come in very nicely, giving us confidence in our credit outlook.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Are you already reserved for these NCOs? Just wondering if there's a reserve release behind that as well.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. We feel very much appropriately reserved for the book that we have. We saw a little bit of increase in our reserve build this quarter just simply because of growth, particularly in cards and things of the like. So that's kind of what has been the driver on the reserve side.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Super. Thanks so much.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nMorning. My first question is for you, Andy. I think what was really striking about this quarter is that the balance sheet growth was impressive on both sides of the sheet and really outperforming peers. At the same time, I think we were all surprised by the stress test results, especially given we thought that the PPNR dynamics with MUFG fully baked in would be a little bit cleaner. So if I'm calculating this right, your adjusted CET1 would be 8% this quarter versus 7.6%. I'm wondering, as we think about balancing those dynamics, how are you thinking about managing growth relative to this sort of changing, unpredictable element of the SCB.\nPlus, obviously, you have done a great job at managing risk-weighted assets last year, and obviously, there's a burn-off rate to the AOCI. At the same time, rates are staying a little bit higher for longer, and there's a huge debate on what's going to happen to the belly of the curve even if everyone subscribes to the Fed cuts. So I'm wondering how we should think about balance sheet management from here, especially in light of the good growth that you experienced this quarter.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Erika. And let me start on the CCAR results. So as you think about MUFG, the component that we were focused on there that did happen was the expense component that came down. So that was as expected. The component that went up versus the Fed last year was the fee income component, and we don't have a lot of clarity or transparency into why that happened. It happened for a number of banks, and it happened in spite of the fact that our fee growth is actually even positive. So that was the part that was the driver of the increased SCB for us and for a number of other banks. Let me take a step back and let me talk about capital and the balance sheet overall.\nAs we've talked about in the past, Erika, our priorities from a capital distribution standpoint haven't changed. First is investing in the business. Second is dividends, and third is buybacks. So as a part of this year's stress test, as we've talked about, our planned capital distribution assumed an increase to the quarterly dividend of about 2% starting in Q4. And as you saw, and as you referenced, our CET1 ratio is 10.3% this quarter. So we continue to have strong capital accretion each quarter. We expect to be well above our fully loaded capital targets well before we will cross that threshold.\nSo from a capital standpoint, we're comfortable with our levels and our ability to accrete 20 to 25 basis points a quarter. So the one open item, as you all know, is the final Basel III Endgame rules. While we prefer to have those clarified before revising our capital and distribution targets, we will assess whatever information we have available and update on our capital distribution, our targets, as well as our return targets at Investor Day on 12 September 2024.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nSo, Andy, just as my follow-up, based on what you've just told us, it doesn't seem as if, as we think about the rest of 2024 and the CCAR years as 1 October 2024 till 30 September 2025, it doesn't sound like we should expect this similar active balance sheet management in terms of growth as we saw in 2023.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo as we've talked about, I think most of the capital accretion going forward, Erika, will be through normal earnings accretion. And as we talked about, we expect that to be 20 to 25 basis points. We had a little bit of a benefit this quarter from additional RWA optimization, but going forward, I would think about that 20 to 25 basis points a quarter.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you to dig in a little bit on the payments business. Obviously, the sequential math worked as normal, but the year-over-year growth looks like it slowed from 4% in Q1 to 3% in Q2. I know we have some easier comps coming up in the second half, but can you just kind of help us understand just the absolute trajectory within the three business areas? And how do you expect that kind of growth rate to go aside from just comps? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So thanks, Ken. I do agree. I think we do expect momentum. Part of that is comps, but we're not obviously relying on that. If I kind of think about the different businesses here, maybe I'll just start with merchant processing. We have seen very good core growth in our tech-led initiative. That's about 1/3 of our sales now, and it has been growing at a very strong rate. The margins on that business, we are seeing nice expansion there. A lot of our non-travel categories are really seeing very good growth. So those are kind of the tailwinds.\nWe have seen some headwinds this quarter, particularly on travel volumes in Europe, but that is something that we hope that will reverse and things of that nature. But otherwise, we feel like we're positioned well on the merchant side of things. On the retail card side, credit card spend is strong and constructive. I would say the Union Bank client acquisition, we're continuing to increase the penetration rate there. But we did see a little bit of a decrease as well just because of risk mitigation around prepaid card, which may pressure this quarter but may linger into a couple of quarters as we move forward.\nBut still, we think that the strong growth on the retail side of things is going to continue to be very helpful. And then on the corporate side of things, we are starting to get into that inflection point of lapping freight and fleet, and all those sorts of things, as well as our bank card is really performing quite well. And so I think those are really some of the things so I think especially on corporate payments, by lapping that fleet kind of in Q3 or so is going to allow for very strong rates as we think about Q4. So at a high level, we just think that there's momentum on this side of things that will allow us to grow and grow nicely.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you. One more follow-up on NII. You had a really good Q2 result, but the outlook for a Q3 is stable, and that's with an extra day. And I'm just wondering, can you just work us through what's the holdback in terms of NII not just growing from here? Was there either some things that helped in the Q2 that don't recur? It looked like your securities yields were a lot higher as one example, but I'm not sure if that would have been it. So why don't we just see the growth straight up from that 40/50 zone we just saw in the Q2? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Well, I think it just comes down to the question earlier that is really around the range of outcomes, what's going to drive it. It's really going to be around the deposit behavior and things. Now, we saw very good trends in terms of rotation out of DDA. That pace has certainly slowed. We continue to expect it to slow moving forward, but it doesn't mean it's over, right? And so there's that component. On the rate-paid side of things, we're just monitoring just how the competitiveness of the deposit rates will go.\nQuite frankly, we don't expect a lot of deposit growth in the next quarter just simply because QT is still around and is still putting pressure on industry liquidity for us and for the market. So that's the primary driver, is just kind of the watch of that. And on top of that, we just don't know if the Fed will cut or not. I know the market has priced that in, but that's another factor in this sort of thing. So those would be the factors I would call out.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nJohn, in our projections, we've assumed two more rate cuts for September and December.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWe have. That's right. We've assumed September and December for rate cuts. That's right.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. Great. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. I just think my math is wrong here, if you can help me out with that. And again, even assuming the four items you just mentioned for NII not going higher in Q3, if you could just highlight your fixed asset repricing a little bit more. Here's my math, and it's clearly wrong because, one, you said securities should reprice up 6 to 8 basis points per quarter, if I heard that correctly. So if you take 7 basis points on $168 billion of securities, that'd be like $100 million extra next quarter. You take your mortgage book of $117 billion, and you take 7 basis points on that. I wasn't sure if you meant 7 basis points on that. But then you get up to almost $200 million more for NII on a base of $4 billion.\nThat'd be 5% growth next quarter, 5% growth the quarter after that, etc., etc. And that's not your guidance. So first, if you could just fix my math as far as the fixed asset repricing on the securities and mortgages, what I'm doing wrong, and then confirm or not those four items that you mentioned offset all of that. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, Mike. Happy to. So I think in terms of the math, in terms of mortgage, that's going to continue given that's very much a fixed-rate book. On the investment portfolio, given current rates, we would expect 6 to 8 basis point increase. However, we assume in our projections, as we just mentioned, that there'll be a cut in September, and about half of our book is floating rate or swap to floating and that sort of thing. And so that will impact the investment portfolio that way. And the deposits, of course, on the other side of that will start to shift. Of course, the institutional side would start to move right away, but the retail side will have an arc to it.\nAnd so it's the movement of the cut within the quarter, which is sort of a part of why we anticipate a relatively stable Q3.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nJust for clarification, you did intend the mortgage book should reprice upward by 7 basis points a quarter also, same as the securities?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, that's right. Mortgage book is kind of that 6 to 8 basis point range.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThen one more follow-up, and I'll re-queue. Your non-interest-bearing deposits, you mentioned that as one of the risk factors. You said it's slowing. Can you remind us what it did between Q2 and Q1 and what's your all-time low for that ratio?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nOh, on the mix of DDA to total deposits, I think 16.2% or so is where we came in this quarter. It was 16.9% a quarter ago. It was 18% or so the quarter before that. So that pace is changing and slowing. And in terms of where it goes, it's going to be just how clients behave and all that sort of thing. But it is an all-time low for us, for sure, as we look back at our data.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMike, on slide seven, there's a chart upper left that shows the migration out that has slowed. It was 7.1% in Q4, down 6.4% in Q1, and then slowed to 1.6% down in Q2 of 2024.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Andy. Hi, John.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, John.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJohn, you talked about the deposits and how you will approach them as the Fed starts to cut rates. I thought it was interesting in your supplement on the average balance sheet that one of your largest deposit categories, if I'm seeing it correctly, money market savings, the yield was down from the prior quarter at 3.85% versus 3.92% in the March quarter. Can you share with us what kind of strategies you used or what took that down when many of the other rates, like time deposits, obviously went up in the quarter?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure, Gerard. No problem. So if you look at that category, it's, as you mentioned, our largest category for deposits. So it's a mix of wholesale, as well as retail, small business, and all that sort of thing. And I think what we have done is, in light of loan growth, obviously, it grew a little bit, but again, it's not growing tremendously. And so we have the opportunity to look at our relationships across the bank and price things in an appropriate manner that makes sense for us to do. And so we've taken some opportunities to exit some high-cost deposits.\nAnd we've really utilized our distribution network, whether that's on the retail side, the branch network, our app capabilities, really taking advantage and our partnerships, really taking advantage of our national bank reach, and really growing in deposits in areas that have a lower cost. And so that's kind of the positive rotation that you're seeing in that specific category.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI got it. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when the Fed starts to cut rates, from this line item, at least, you guys could potentially benefit from lower rates and the balances continue to grow, which obviously would be beneficial. Andy, just a more bigger macro question. John touched it a little bit a moment ago about the utilization rate on the C&I loans. Can you share with us, when you guys go out and talk to clients, what are they thinking? Commercial clients, that is. What are they thinking about CapEx spending, which would enable them to draw down lines?\nAnd then second, are you seeing any increased competition from alternative lenders, whether it's private credit or other, that may be affecting the C&I loan growth?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, Gerard. I think our clients are probably a little bit more focused on defense than offense right now. We just did a CEO survey, and we talked to clients. They are focused on productivity, efficiency, expense management, and in the investments that they're making to the extent that they're utilizing lending activity is to really amplify some of that efficiency opportunity that they're focused on. So a little bit more on defense. But as John mentioned, the utilization rates were up modestly in pockets across the board, and I would expect that to continue as we go forward. So nothing significantly different from what we saw in prior quarters. The competition is strong.\nSo both bank and non-bank competition, that's driving pricing a little bit. We're continuing to seek full relationships with appropriate returns, and that'll drive the volumes as well.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAnd just as a quick follow-up on the competition, are you guys seeing more aggressive underwriting for banks that want to grow that balance sheet? How are you seeing that from the underwriting standpoint?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. I'm not sure that the underwriting is changing significantly as opposed to the pricing, Gerard. That's how I would focus on it.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Thank you, Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Wanted to circle back on payments. A lot of good details kind of by segment but was wondering if you could update kind of your thoughts on the growth you expect for full year this year, and then just still it might be a little bit lower than what you were thinking before, and then just the medium-term outlook if that's still the same.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. I'll answer your second question first. The medium-term outlook has not changed in terms of growth rate trajectory for the payment businesses. So we think of high single-digit growth in terms of the merchant and corporate payments system categories, and we think of mid-single-digit growth as we get into the credit card, debit card kind of area. As I mentioned, we had 4% or so, and then 3% growth this quarter and the last two quarters on a year-over-year basis. We would expect momentum as we move forward and getting and approaching those sort of medium-term levels.\nAnd some of the puts and takes I had mentioned earlier are going to be kind of the drivers of that. And of course, whether or not we're on the higher end or lower end is going to depend upon spend levels and where that ultimately comes through. But we feel confident in terms of where the market's going and how that is. So we feel like we're well-positioned in that space.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then what's the prepaid card risk mitigation that you referred to? Maybe I missed if you've mentioned that in the past, but can you just remind us what that is and how long it might be driving for?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks. Yeah. So it's just more fraud and things of that variety that has picked up. And so there's just some areas there that we want to mitigate against. And so we've chosen to just step away from some of those sorts of things.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd then how much of a drag is it and how long will it continue? That's my last one. Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, I think it's, I mean, you saw the card growth rate was about 1% or so versus our sales area of about 3% to 4%. So I think there's going to be some of that pressure in Q3 or so.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Hi. Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nA couple of just follow-ups. One on payments. To try to understand, I know you've said merchant you expect to get to high single-digit. What's happening with that when I look at the volumes, merchant was only up 1.7% year on year, and that's the slowest volume growth we've seen in six quarters. So why has, despite all the tech-led initiatives, which are great, and the other areas that you're trying to expand, why has volume growth slowed so much? And then what would cause that to turn around?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So I can talk to that, Vivek. So on the merchant processing side, you mentioned that the sales component was about 2% or so. In terms of where we saw some volume decreases was really had to do with travel, particularly on the European side of things. Volumes were just lower for our clients in that particular area. So that's really the focal point. I think if you think about as we start to lap some of that sort of thing and same-store sales come in and that sort of thing, that's where we expect the momentum in the second half of the year.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Okay. Shifting gears. You're talking about charge-offs going to 60 basis points in the second half. Delinquencies are down, so that should help. But your C&I losses are running high. Despite the losses, NPLs are running still up. First, a two-part question there. Where in C&I are you seeing these losses? Which industry sectors, and your overall charge-off rate of 60 basis points, which categories do you expect would tick that up from where you are currently, given the outlook for delinquencies coming down?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So on your two-parter, I'll take the C&I question first. First of all, the increase there in charge-off was really attributed to one unique or idiosyncratic loan that went through, and that was an NPA that we saw a couple of quarters ago that worked its way through. We don't anticipate anything really in the C&I book outside of that. So that is something that we're not concerned about. On the rest of the charge-offs, if I think about just at a big picture on credit card, for example, we did see a little bit of an increase in charge-offs this quarter. But given the delinquency, as you just mentioned, we would expect our charge-offs in Q3 and Q4 to look more like Q1.\nI think the balance of it will be more kind of in the commercial real estate office side of things. That's kind of the puts and takes to the charge-off guide.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. So you had one large loan written off. But then what refilled that bucket, John, given that the NPLs actually ticked up, not down in C&I?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, yeah. I mean, I think it's just very modest. It's more idiosyncratic type loans. It's not something that we're holistically concerned about at any rate.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nVivek, as you mentioned, and as John mentioned, the delinquency levels are stable. So that drives stabilization on credit card. The idiosyncratic loan that John mentioned is Q2. As we think about the future, I think the lumpiness will come out of CRE office. That's the one that's going to go up and down a little bit. We've talked about that. We've mentioned that in prior calls. Certainly manageable, but that'll just cause a little bit up and down.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, John.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning. Andy, I appreciate the color you gave on capital. As you look at it, I know it sounds like you're still on the sidelines on buybacks as you walk through your priorities and the expectation for capital here. I guess what changes that? Is it continued pull to par on the AOCI side? Is it Basel III clarity? Is it clarity on rates? What gets you to the point where you get confidence in buyback outlook or how you're thinking about your internal CET1 target? If you could just walk us through your thought process there.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So let me start, John, by saying that I'm very confident in our capital levels and our ability to accrete capital. It's consistent with what we've talked about, that 20 to 25 basis points. And we've made great improvements, as you saw from the number, 140 basis points up over the last year. So let me start there. Second, as we talked about before, we were seeking clarity on two components. Number one is CCAR, which we now have, and number two is Basel III Endgame, which we're getting closer to. And my expectation, John, is that we will, one way or the other, we'll have more clarity.\nOr if not the perfect answer, we will update on both our capital targets and distribution objectives as we think about it at Investor Day on 12 September 2024. So I'll give you a full update at that point.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks. Appreciate that. Then separately, on operating leverage, I know you reiterated your confidence in achieving positive operating leverage in the second half of this year. I mean, can you help us? I know you're not giving formal 2025 expectations, but I'm trying to think about what that positive operating leverage you're generating in the back half for that expectation, what that could mean as we look into the quarters through 2025. I mean, it looks like incentives is ballparking around 300 basis points positive operating leverage when you look at full year 2025 expectations. You were above 200 basis points in 2022, but in the years prior, you were well below that.\nWhat's a good way to think about it, medium term, in terms of where USB should be operating from that standpoint?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nLet me do it in components. So first of all, as you saw this quarter, our expenses were relatively flat, and we focused on the 16.8 or lower for the full year 2024. So we are past the point of investment in the curve on increasing expenses and now realizing the benefits from those expenses. So I would expect us to be moderate from an expense growth standpoint going forward and managing that well. We talked about the momentum in fee growth, and I would expect that to continue given the unique businesses we have. I think the biggest difference is the headwind that was net interest income turned into a tailwind this quarter.\nAnd as we talked about stabilization in the third quarter, I think as we get into 2025, that becomes more of a tailwind. And those things all drive positive operating leverage into 2025.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nYeah. Good morning. Hi. It's a small item, but a curiosity to me. I mean, I noticed that your automobile loan portfolio is down by more than 30% year-over-year. And I'm just curious, how did that category suddenly become a no-fly zone? Because you'd think it's short-duration assets. You'd think it would be attractive given the.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Sure, Chris. So in terms of the drop, obviously, we haven't been as active in the auto loan market just simply because the spreads and the returns on those sorts of loans have not been at our standard. And the competitors that we're facing aren't banks, and they have a different return profile in this particular environment. That doesn't mean we've exited or anything like that. In fact, we've been very strong in terms of some of the leasing and some of the other areas. And we continue to monitor that market very closely. And if the spreads and returns are appropriate, we will be very active in that space just as we have been in the past.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nHi. Hey, good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the cards growth, 1.4% year on year, credit up 4.3%. I guess, John, is that entirely due to the exiting or the reducing of the exposure to prepaid? Or are you seeing any weakness in debit as well? That would be somewhat unusual. Typically debit in an environment where there is an economic slowdown tends to outperform. So just any additional color there. And just wanted to reaffirm that this is sort of a transitory thing, and you should lap this. And I suspect in the Q4, is that? Did I get that right?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp",
    "content2": "Yeah. I think to answer your question very simply, I mean, the difference between the fee growth versus the sales is really all prepaid on that side of things. We see strong trends in terms of credit card spend and all the Union penetration, all those things that I mentioned. Those are the things. And all the different partnerships that we have, those are all still very good. It's just that it's all on the prepaid side.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nOkay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on deposit dynamics. You've talked a few times about the slowing of the rotation. But if I look at period-end non-interest-bearing, it did fall close to 5% sequentially, and much different, much worse than, or much larger sequential decline than you see on average. Just anything there that you want to call out? What drove that? And is it something that's somewhat transitory or not?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI want to thank for asking that question because I want to point something out. We have a lot of volatility in the day-to-day NIB deposit levels, principally due to our corporate trust business that has payments coming in and out on a daily basis. Depending upon where the quarter ends, the holidays, the end of the week, and the end of the month, you could have volatility. We are very focused on the average balances. I would encourage you to do the same because day-to-day, it could be very volatile, and it does not indicate any trends.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nGot it. All right. Thanks very much.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. During the last quarter, there's been a few management changes, people leaving, people getting repositioned. And I think as we get ready for the 12 September 2024 Investor Day, we might look at the presenters and say, \"Wow, these are a lot different than the presenters at your last Investor Day.\" So I'm just trying to figure out what the tea leaves are saying. And maybe you can just tell us directly, Andy, and in terms of what is your time horizon for remaining CEO? And who are the contenders to be the next CEO of U.S. Bancorp? And would you consider looking outside of U.S. Bancorp for your successor? Just a little more color on all the moves that have taken place. Thanks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Mike. So as it relates to Investor Day, you're going to see some new faces for sure, but you're going to see some familiar faces as well. So we'll have a good mix of both people that you're very familiar with as far as and some new. One of the things that we made a change with was putting Gunjan in the President's role. And about a year and a half ago, we combined what was then called WSIB to the institutional wealth group together with the corporate and commercial group. And the synergies, the activity, and the customer focus that evolved from that was just terrific.\nSo Gunjan has that same objective to do that with the entire bank, with the payments organization, with the consumer and business banking organization, and pulling together the leadership under one the businesses under one leader with the customer in the center, and really taking advantage of all the diverse set of businesses that we have to really grow the business. That's the objective. She's done a terrific job with that already. She's already started very fast to do it with the entire bank. I'm looking forward to sharing that story on 12 September 2024.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. And the departures, anything related to that? Is that?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nNo, Mike. Yeah, Mike, I would just say that's natural activity. We've had a very stable senior leadership group for years and years. And sometimes change happens, but there's no messaging in that.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. So the theme, not to front-run your conference too much, is it's one USB. You've done more one USB with wealth and commercial, and now you're looking to be one USB, deliver the whole firm to the client, that sort of simple statement that's easy to say, tough to execute.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nExactly.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks, guys. I just had a follow-up on the securities book. Just can you help us understand the meaningful increase that happened this quarter in the yields? And then also, you mentioned 50% of the bond book is floating. Is that the total bond book? And then can you help us understand how much of that book is swapped and what you do with that going forward given the rate outlook? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So on the securities book, in terms of the quarter, the 19 basis point increase, a majority of that was related to opportunistically taking some of the excess liquidity that we had and putting it into the securities book. And so you can think of that as short-dated treasuries or treasury swap to floating, that sort of thing, which is the equivalent from an interest rate risk perspective versus cash, is just kind of a simple way to think about it. In terms of the book itself, I would say that I made that comment because about in terms of AFS risk and all that sort of thing, we have hedged approximately 40% or so of the risk component.\nAnd then that, coupled with just natural floating rate securities that we have within the book that are already floating, that gets you to about 50% that are either floating or synthetically floating through swaps. So that's kind of the details of it. Now, on the other side of that, we have put on hedges to put receive-fixed swaps on our corporate book so that if rates do fall, we're protected on that end as well. So those are kind of the balances. All in, it gets us to where we want to be from an interest rate risk standpoint, which is neutral to shocks, which is where we are today.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. So are you saying that that gets you to around half of the total book, AFS and HTM?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Cool. Sorry, just one last one. Under $16.8 billion for costs after the Q2 result, can you just remind us what that means for the trajectory from here? Thanks again for the follow-ups.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. 16.8 or less, that's our fee or excuse me, that's our expense outlook. Where we have been over the last couple of quarters is very consistent with where we're at. As Andy talked about, we've hit that point on the investment curve. We continue to feel like we're in a very good spot in terms of managing expense going forward.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Ken.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions in our queue at this time. Mr. Andersen, I turn the call back over to you.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Krista. Thanks to everyone who joined our call this morning. Please contact the investor relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Krista, you can now disconnect the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

If you would like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your phone. If you wish to withdraw your question, please press star then one again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 8:00 AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSenior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Rochelle, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm joined by our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Cecere, our Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, Terry Dolan, and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Stern. Together with some initial prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation.\nA copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules are on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that can materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, our press release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. In Q1, we reported earnings per share of $0.78, which included $0.12 per share of notable items. Excluding notables, earnings per share totaled $0.90. Our balance sheet remains strong.\nWe are maintaining our through-the-cycle underwriting discipline and seeing the benefits of our multi-year investments in digital, technology, and payments ecosystem in the form of strong fee growth across our business lines. Importantly, we continue to accrete capital this quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the period at 10.0%, and our return on tangible common equity ratio was 17.4% on an adjusted basis. Slide four provides additional performance metrics on both a reported and adjusted basis. On slide five, I'll provide some additional high-level observations for the quarter.\nStarting with the balance sheet, credit quality metrics continue to develop in line with our expectations, and we achieved healthy growth in tangible book value per share on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Loan and deposit growth remains under pressure for the industry, and that dynamic impacted our net interest income this quarter.\nOur NII on a taxable equivalent basis of approximately $4 billion was within our guidance, albeit on the lower end of the range. We are seeing good opportunities for loan growth in targeted portfolios, and notably, we continue to see consumer deposit growth despite the impact of QT on industry deposit levels. Over the past few weeks, the outlook for potential rate cuts in 2024 has meaningfully changed as long-term rates have backed up.\nClient behavior across the industry is adjusting in response to the potential higher-for-longer interest rate environment that has impacted our deposit mix and pressured deposit costs. As a result, we now expect our NII for the full year to be lower than anticipated. However, we are taking a closer look at our expense base given these near-term NII headwinds and plan to take actions to mitigate the impact of lower-than-expected NII to our overall profitability.\nJohn will go into more details on these topics, but importantly, we believe this is a near-term phenomenon. Turning to slide six, we continue to feel good about the momentum across our differentiated fee businesses. Fee income represents about 40% of our total net revenue, which stands to position us well in a lower interest rate environment. Overall, we are encouraged by our current trends in our client growth and penetration rates, as evidenced by the continued strength we have seen across many of our fee revenue businesses this quarter.\nSlide seven provides an update on our differentiated payments ecosystem. Over the past few years, we have made good progress to both expand our business banking and payments relationships and grow related revenue associated with these relationships.\nYou may recall we discussed an opportunity to grow small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% a few years ago. As you can see on this slide, we're making good progress and see even greater opportunity to further expand these relationships and related revenue in the medium term. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as provide forward-looking guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. On slide eight, we provide an earnings summary. This quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.78, or $0.90 per share after adjusting for notable items, including the last of the merger and integration costs of $155 million following our acquisition of Union Bank and $110 million related to anticipated increase in the FDIC special assessment.\nTurning to slide nine, total average loans were $371 billion, down 0.5% linked quarter, as growth was impacted by slow industry loan demand in the current higher interest rate environment. Despite tightening monetary policy and ongoing pressure on industry-wide deposits, our total average deposits of $503 billion were stable linked quarter, as we continue to see our efforts to grow consumer-related deposits materialize. End-of-period deposit growth was a little higher than we would typically see in Q1.\nTrust and corporate deposit inflows were seasonally higher at the end of Q1. However, the impact of holiday timing at quarter-end delayed planned outflows of institutional deposits, which resulted in temporarily higher cash levels. We expect deposit outflows to move in line with more typical seasonal patterns. Importantly, we continue to proactively manage the balance sheet by prioritizing opportunities that exceeded our cost of capital and further optimized our funding mix.\nWe continue to limit our reliance on short-term borrowings and remain disciplined on deposit rate paid as we focus on relationship-based deposits. Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.0 billion, down 3.1% linked quarter, and net interest margin declined 8 basis points to 2.70%. Both net interest income and net interest margin declines were driven by continued unfavorable deposit mix shift and deposit pricing pressure, as well as slower loan demand.\nSlide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income increased 7.7%, or $193 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher payments revenue, continued strength in underlying capital markets activity, and stronger mortgage banking fees.\nOn a link quarter basis, non-interest income, as adjusted, decreased 1.4%, or $38 million, reflective of seasonal declines in payments volume and previously discussed impacts related to the exiting of our ATM cash provisioning business, which pressured service charges, and lower tax credit syndication fees, which impacted other revenue. Turning to slide 12, reported non-interest expense for Q4 totaled $4.5 billion, which included approximately $265 million of notable items.\nNon-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $10 million, or 0.2% on a link quarter basis, and $117 million, or 2.7% year-over-year, driven by both cost synergies with Union Bank and our continued focus on operational efficiency. Slide 13 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with our expectations. Link quarter, non-performing assets increased 20%, reflecting continued stress in our commercial real estate office portfolio and one idiosyncratic commercial loan.\nThe ratio of Non-Performing Assets to loans and other real estate was 0.48% at 31 March, compared with 0.40% at 31 December and 0.30% a year ago. Our Q1 net charge-off ratio of 0.53% increased 4 basis points from a Q4 level of 0.49% and was higher when compared to Q1 2023 level of 0.3%, as adjusted. Our allowance for credit losses as of 31 March totaled $7.9 billion, or 2.1% of period-end loans.\nTurning to slide 14, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.0% as of 31 March was reflective of a 10 basis point increase from year-end, which included 20 basis points of net capital accretion, offset by a CECL transitional impact of 10 basis points. We remain well above our regulatory capital minimum requirements. I'll now provide forward-looking guidance on slide 15.\nWe expect net interest income for Q2 on an FTE basis to be relatively stable, with the Q1 level of approximately $4.0 billion. Full year 2024 net interest income on an FTE basis is now expected to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. Our revised guidance reflects a shift in commercial client deposit behavior in a higher-for-longer rate environment and heightened competitive industry dynamics.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in non-interest income. Given the pressure we are seeing on net interest income, we are reducing our expense guidance for the year. We now expect full year non-interest expense of $16.8 billion or lower, which compares to $17.0 billion in 2023. Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John. We have been preparing for a wide range of economic scenarios for some time now, and we continue to deliver industry-leading returns despite the current industry stress. Our diverse business mix is allowing us to differentiate in a competitive market, and we are seeing the benefit of the investments we've made and continue to make in our digital capabilities, our technology modernization, and our payments ecosystem.\nThe message I'd like to leave you with is that we will successfully navigate through the near-term challenges the industry is facing, but more importantly, we are well-positioned for the future and continue to manage the company with a long-term lens. Let me close by recognizing the many dedicated employees for all they do to support the constituents of our national banking franchise.\nIt is because of our exceptional talent pool that we remain poised to execute on our capital-efficient growth objectives and continue to deliver the financial performance our shareholders have come to expect. We will now open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks for taking the morning. Morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping either Andy or John, you could talk just in a little more detail about sort of the nuance in the tougher NII guide for the full year.\nSo, I guess at an industry level, we've got a couple of dynamics at play, whether it's the challenging loan growth environment or, of course, the impact of higher-for-longer on deposit costs and betas. So maybe the main one or two kind of pressure points you saw. And then, I guess as the follow-up, it doesn't feel like there'll necessarily be a lot more pressure on NII. It's just that it might not advance in the second half. Is that the best way to think about it?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Scott, good morning, and thanks for the question. So maybe just take a step back just to answer your question. In January, when we talked about our guidance, we looked at and we expected our 2024 net interest income to be in line with the annualized Q4 number, given that was past MUB actions that we had taken throughout the course of the year. So to your point, we're 1% to 3% lower than that new guide with our new guidance here.\nThe outlook really speaks to changes or the dynamics that we have in the economy, the interest rate environment, the dynamics in the deposit environment, those sorts of things. The conversation, of course, has shifted. At the beginning of the year, there were multiple cuts. Now we're shifting to more higher-for-longer. What we've witnessed over that time is that our client behavior, particularly in the corporate and mid-market sections, have been shifting their behavior.\nClients are continuing to rotate out of low-cost deposits into higher-cost deposits. The pace of this action is slowing. We absolutely see that. It's just not slowing as fast as what we would have anticipated. So to boil that all together, what we do see now with our guidance is that we have the Q2 net interest income will be relatively stable, and we should see growth in the second half of the year.\nWe provided a range, given that uncertainty in terms of client behavior and things of that variety. The final thing I would just say is that we recognize this upfront, and we're taking action. We are looking at our expense base, taking action, and pulling some levers that we have been looking at. So that's kind of how we think about the guidance from a big-picture perspective.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John. And Scott, I just add that we continue to look for opportunities to improve efficiencies, particularly in this higher-for-longer rate environment. So we benefited from the $900 million cost takeouts from the Union Bank transaction, and we continue to focus on additional efficiencies in areas like procurement and third-party spend, our workplace management, and our properties and real estate.\nAnd probably the area of greatest emphasis is operational efficiencies as we centralize our operations activities and technology investments we've made to really improve the effectiveness and efficiency in how we deliver our products and services. So that will continue to be a focus and a lens for us, and those are the actions we're taking.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Perfect. Thank you very much, Andy and John.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nI guess maybe just following up on NII, John, if we could drill a little bit into it. One, the securities yield went down one basis point sequentially. Just remind us of the dynamic, both in terms of the securities book and fixed-rate asset repricing that we should be mindful of going forward. And then non-interest-bearing deposits, I think, saw a big surge at the end of the quarter. Again, what's the right way to think about NIB balances and mix as we look forward? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So maybe I'll start with your first question. On the securities yield, it was relatively flat or down one basis point, as you cited. This quarter is a little bit different. We had taken some hedging actions that actually offset some of the asset churn that we typically would see.\nI would view this as more of a temporary thing. As I look forward, the typical churn that you see in asset repricing of that book, as a reminder, it's about $3 billion per quarter that is rolling off at the lower level and will replace. That's really going to be what we're looking at kind of going forward. I would just look at this as an anomaly. On the deposit side, yeah, I believe your question was on the surge in deposits. We did see a surge at the end of the quarter. There was a holiday in there. A lot of customers placed balances with us, very much temporary.\nA lot of those balances kind of hung on in and out here through tax season. We typically have that. It's just higher than what we would typically see for various reasons. And so as we mentioned in our comments, we expect that to get to more seasonal levels. And then just your follow-on was really on the non-interest-bearing side of things. It's continued to trend down that mix of NIB versus total deposits. We're kind of in that 17% category right now. As we're in a higher-for-longer, it's possible that continues to drift lower just based on the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. And I guess just separately around outlook for fee revenues, I think Andy addressed that in his prepared remarks. But give us a sense of what areas you're seeing momentum on the fee revenue side and whether there's any room for sort of upside surprise if we get additional negative guide downs on NII? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, sure. So I mean, overall, we feel very pleased with the Q1 results. We saw good account growth. We're deepening relationships. We continue to see progress on Union and the growth opportunities that we see there. Consumer spending metrics, all the underlying metrics are strong. Capital markets activities are strong. And that is supportive of our continual view on mid-single-digit growth on the fee aspect of things. Areas that we see growth, we particularly have seen that in the capital market space.\nWe had extremely strong fixed-income capital market activity, a lot of issuance that came to market, and our franchise absolutely benefited from that. Mortgage has continued to be strong in terms of even though applications and production has been lower on a year-over-year basis, we're actually seeing much wider spreads just given the areas that we're focusing on. And that's just a constant theme of how we're focusing on more return on equity or higher returns overall.\nAnd then the payments business continues to do well and be in line with our expectations. And that helps us support the payments ecosystem that we have and all the initiatives and investment that we've made over time. So all that is very much coming together, and we feel very comfortable about our fee outlook.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Ebrahim.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGood morning, John.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nHow are you thinking about the outlook for net charge-offs and provision and just kind of the credit trends you saw this quarter? John, you mentioned there was the one idiosyncratic commercial. Other than that, kind of what are you seeing? And you're still kind of thinking about a mid-50s kind of net charge-off outlook for this year. It would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, John, this is Terry. Let me take that question. So when we end up looking at credit, again, credit generally is pretty strong. I think that we're continuing to see in non-performing assets that that will continue to tick up and did tick up in Q1. It's primarily related to commercial real estate office space. And I think when we think about kind of the rest of the year, probably in Q2, it's going to tick up a bit more.\nBut then that growth rate's going to really moderate quite a bit. The thing to keep in mind with respect to the commercial real estate office space is we've aggressively reserved for that. We feel like we've adequately covered the loss content that's in that portfolio.\nSo even though NPAs are likely to tick up, we don't see that as a real impact from a P&L standpoint. From a charge-off point of view, in Q1, that's principally driven by just credit cards. And our expectation is that that will probably in Q2 also come up. But then on a full-year basis, the charge-off rate that we would expect in credit cards is probably going to move up a bit in Q2 and then start to moderate downward again. On a full-year basis, we would expect that charge-off rate to be pretty similar to the charge-off rate that we see in Q1, about 4.25%.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Got it. And then for the overall company, kind of still kind of trending to that mid-50s perhaps on the charge-offs?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, I would say mid-50s, maybe closer to the 60 basis points. Again, I think that it's going to be a little bit lumpy because of just timing of commercial real estate charge-offs that will occur through the year. But again, we feel like we've adequately reserved for it.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. Okay. Great. And then, Andy, how are you thinking about the expense flex? You mentioned offsetting the NII. I guess within reason, you're going to flex the expenses depending on the revenue environment plays out through the year?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, John. So it is an environment that it's always important to look at efficiencies. And that's something we're very focused on. And it is in those areas we talked about. We'll continue to flex where we see opportunities. We've centralized operations. We have other opportunities in spend. It's a company-wide initiative, and we'll continue to focus on that.\nAgain, importantly, though, I want to tell you, John, that we're still investing, but we're looking at operational efficiencies as we deliver our products and services while continuing investments. Because the investments we've made are helping us with the efficiencies on a go-forward basis.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWelcome back, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, thanks so much. So I had a follow-up on the comments around corporate behavior in the deposit shift from NIB. I just want to understand two things. One is, do you see your corporate deposits shifting from NIB to IB, or is it more NIB to MMF? And then separately, typically, corporates are in NIB because it's compensating balances for other services. So as this shift is going on, does it suggest that we're going to see an uptick in, say, for example, treasury services or any of the other fee lines?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, Betsy. It's John. Thanks for that. So in terms of the behavior, I think what we're seeing is the trends are slowing. The rotation is going. Maybe first to answer your question, more from NIB into more IB. And it's more of the trade-off for the client. And what we're seeing really there is clients are just optimizing and being as just looking at their balance sheet, looking at their balances, especially in this higher-rate environment. And now that they know it's going to be here for a longer period of time, they're taking a closer eye to it.\nWe're just seeing that more and more. So the trends have been slowing of that mix shift. It's just taking longer than what we would have anticipated. So in terms of compensating balances, those are the things that are on a case-by-case basis with the clients. We look at the ECR rates that we pay, and customers will then make decisions based on that. And so those are kind of the trade-offs that we see relative to that right now.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. So treasury services potentially could see a little pop-up in growth as how you pay for services changes, or is that an overreach?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nIt's possible. But again, the dynamics are pretty fluid, kind of how I would describe it.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And also, folks are staying on your balance sheet as opposed to going off balance sheet into MMF.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThat's right. Yeah. A lot of this is defending clients and making sure we're there for them. Again, we view this as a temporary phenomenon. This is just a timing thing. It's really just the churn here is continuing. It's just being the pace of it is taking a little bit longer for it to stabilize than what we would have anticipated. And that's really what's going on here. We want to make sure we're here for the long run for our clients and serving them as we kind of transition through this rate environment.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Okay. That's super helpful. And then just kind of 30,000-foot question here. Just could you help us understand how you are currently thinking about the asset sensitivity of U.S. Bancorp at this stage? How should we think about what higher-for-longer means for you for the whole organization? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, sure. So I think in terms of asset sensitivity from a risk management perspective, we are as neutral as you can be. We've taken a lot of different actions to make sure because we just don't know where the rate environment is. I mean, it was seven cuts at the beginning of the year the market had. Now it's closer to zero. So we just want to make sure we are prepared for different types of rate environments. And so I think as we think about the asset sensitivity, that is really how we're positioning ourselves.\nAs we think about higher-for-longer and what that means, the drivers there are going to be clearly deposit betas and rates paid, and all that sort of thing may creep up. The offset to that is we're going to have asset churn on the loan side as well as the investment portfolio side. And over time, those things will offset and turn ultimately in our favor. But it's going to be that timing that's really going to matter in terms of what do those things move and shift over time.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo Betsy as John said this is Andy. We've tried to narrow the corridor of volatility given the uncertainty in the outlook. And so we are about as neutral as we can be given all the puts and takes John talked about.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Betsy.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. If I could ask a couple of questions on the fee side. One, can we just talk a little bit through the payments businesses? Looks like the overall year-over-year growth rate was 4%. I think you're aspiring for upper single digits. It looks like corporate was down year-over-year, and maybe the rate in merchant slowed a little bit. So can you just talk us through some of those dynamics and then how you'd expect that trajectory going forward?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Yeah. I think thanks, Ken. I appreciate that. We can look at maybe I'll take them in order. Merchant was kind of in that 4% area as you mentioned on the fee side of things. On that side, this quarter, we saw travel being a little bit down. But the other underlying metrics really have strong growth. We saw our tech-led initiatives really continue to propel very nicely. We saw high single digits for virtually all the other categories in that space.\nSo we think the travel is just kind of a short-term nature thing here. And we're well-positioned and continue to feel good about high single digits there. On the corporate side, corporate payment side, as you mentioned, that was negative on a year-over-year basis. But we are lapping the freight weight that has happened over the past year. And that will really turn. There might be a little bit more in that in Q2. But we see strong momentum as we look.\nAgain, the fundamentals of business spend and things like that are continuing to be on pace. So we feel good about high single digits. And then on the card side, really strong fee growth, good spreads, payment rates, and payment spend trends constructive for how we're thinking about it. So we feel good about all the underlying trends from a payment standpoint.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. And then just in terms of some of the other lines, corporate services and mortgage did a lot better. I think you mentioned DCM and corporate and better gain on sale. Just wondering, are those both sustainable, or was there any pull forward on both of those areas this quarter?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI think it is. I think the underlying strength maybe had a little bit of positivity here in the Q1. But underlying all that, I think the gain on sale and the markets that we're playing is legitimate. Even though the market has been slower from an application standpoint, a production standpoint, it's still kind of double-digit, almost 20% down from year-over-year. So there's a lot of the volumes are lower, but the spreads are wider. And we anticipate that to continue going forward.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Great. And last cleanup one, just that ATM business, it didn't look like service charges changed. Did that close it? I know it's not a net profit. I know it's neutral net profit. But can you just update us on that? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. There was some of that in this quarter. And so they'll kind of fully run off here in the second quarter.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nWith an offsetting cost?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYes.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Another one on net interest income. Andy, you used the word temporary in your opening remarks talking about either the decline or the worst guide. And I didn't know what you meant by temporary.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo what we're saying, Mike, is that this pressure that, as John described, we believe is going to dissipate and has dissipated, is just dissipating slower than we thought. And we expect a relatively stable in the Q2 and then growth in the back half of 2024. So that's what I meant by temporary.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nDo you have any expectations for 2025 and where the floor is for non-interest-bearing deposits or any other color?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo I would expect that 2025 would continue the momentum that we've seen in the second half of 2024. We're not going to give a 2025 guide right now because it's so volatile in terms of what rates could be. But importantly, Mike, we see the second half of 2024 even in a lower rate cut environment and higher-for-longer to start to go up.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd I know I've asked this before, but it still applies, I think. So the big picture here is you got $900 million of savings in the Union Bank acquisitions. That's good for the expenses. The revenues you highlight in your slide, business banking is up 1/3 over three years in terms of revenues and relationships. You have mortgage. You have capital markets. You have payments.\nThe revenues are working. The expenses are working. Then we look at the efficiency ratio for this quarter. The core number is around 62% for a company that for so long had an efficiency ratio under 60%. Now, I know you're investing a lot nationally. We heard that at the BANC conference. But it's just like, when do you get under 60%? I get the NII effect that distorts things. But you do have some peers that are under 60% now. So how should we think about efficiency as U.S. Bancorp?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah, Mike. That's why we're pulling these expense levers and looking at continuing to create efficiency. I feel very positive about our fee categories. We have a diversified set of businesses, a lot of businesses that other banks don't have, like payments and commercial products, fund services, corporate trusts that helps us drive fee revenue.\nThat's the strength that we talked about, that 7.7%. There are some headwinds on margin for the industry and for ourself. We'll get past those headwinds, and we'll continue to operate efficiently and look for expense levers to get that efficiency ratio downward. And that's an objective of ours.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, John.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nMorning. Morning. On the deposit growth in the quarter, the surge in growth you saw at the end of period, can you maybe size up the impact that was more seasonal and more tied to the holiday dynamic and how much that could pull back? And then separately, also on your NII commentary, you did mention the competitive landscape shifting. Is that just regarding the deposit mix and pricing, or are you also seeing some competitive dynamic impacting you on the loan front? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, John. Thanks. Maybe to answer your second question first, it's more of a deposit mix and rate paid. It's not necessarily the loan side. I think actually on the loan side, we see even though loans are soft at this point, we do see decent momentum on the commercial side. We saw a good period-end growth there. Spreads are good. The asset churn is positive all there. I think it's just, again, it's not back on the deposit side of things in the mix.\nAnd I would say even on the mix, I would say on the commercial side, it's just a rotational thing. The rates environment really hasn't changed on the commercial side. On the retail side, sometimes rates go up, sometimes down depending on geography, market, and all those sorts of things. We're competitive there, and we want to make sure that we're growing. We have been growing. We've been growing consumer deposits, as we mentioned. Back on your first question on the deposit surge, it's probably in the area of $15 billion to $20 billion that we received.\nWe get a lot of inflow at the end of the quarter as people prepare for outflowing payments, end-of-the-month type payments or first of the month, as well as fifth of the month. Then sometimes they just hold it all the way through the tax season. That's exactly what we've seen here, is that you get this kind of surge up at the end of the quarter. It holds for the duration through tax day, and then it starts to wind down. And that's been very seasonal. It's just a bigger number than what we have typically seen.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then separately, on the expense efforts where you're taking a closer look, and you mentioned some of the areas, are those measures that you're taking fully reflected in that updated expense outlook of $16.8 billion for the year, or could your efforts drive a somewhat lower number as you evaluate the opportunity?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo, John, they're reflected in the efforts. That's why we brought it down to $200 million. And in the note, you'll see that's $16.8 billion at least. So we could pull additional levers as we continue to focus on this, but it is reflected in the guidance.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning. Morning.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nJust want to probe, Andy, a comment that you expect net interest income to go up in the second half of 2024. Could you talk a little bit about what you see as the drivers of that?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI'm going to let John start, and then I'll add on.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. The drivers really, Vivek, as we talked about, it comes down to the deposit side of things really first and foremost. And again, we're seeing the migration and rotation slow. Again, it's just taking some time. So eventually, as that goes, that will stabilize. And then you're going to have the continual asset churn on both loans as well as investment portfolio, things like that.\nI would also say that we've taken a lot of action to enhance return on equity. We're looking at capital-efficient ways to grow that. Those underlying themes continue. The Union growth, the opportunities that we see, and loan spreads have been favorable. So those are kind of the reasons that we see a positive nature and bend to the net interest income that Andy talked about.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo, as John said, it's the repricing of loans, the expectation of stabilization of the flow of deposits, and the securities portfolio churn that we talked about.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nAnd the hedge that you did, which you said was an anomaly this quarter, could you talk a little bit about that? Was that? Or that's not going to have an ongoing impact? Was that just something that you put on for capital protection, or what was it?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Yeah. So it really was more to get our asset sensitivity to continue to be neutral. So those are actions that we took kind of as a one-time matter. So it's in the rearview and going forward. That's why I called it as a temporary measure here in this quarter. Going forward, again, the driver here in investment portfolio is the $3 billion or so that's rolling off at lower yields and will be replaced at now current higher interest rates.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. Because you'd always said you were neutral. So that's why I was trying to understand what sort of change that you had to do to make it go to neutral.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYep. Those are part of the actions that we take to get neutral. And those are the things that the team looks at on a frequent basis. We're actively managing that on a daily basis. We're looking at markets. We're taking actions. This is just the result of that.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nOkay. And is that what, just receive fixed swaps you added or terminated, or what did you do?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, specifically, they were pay fixed swaps that we had terminated. They were shorter-dated in nature, but it reduced the yield because the pay fixed carry had been gone. But that just neutralized our interest rate sensitivity.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, Andy. Good morning, John.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJohn and Andy, can you share with us? Obviously, you had a nice move up in your CET1 ratio. It's now at 10%. And we all know the Basel III Endgame is coming. Nobody knows for certain when that final proposal will be in place.\nBut it seems like for the category two and three banks that the unrealized securities losses will be carried through regulatory capital, which is not the case today, of course. So with that as a backdrop, can you update us on where you want that CET1 ratio? And historically, you guys have been so good at giving back 75% to 80% of your annual earnings, dividends, and buybacks. And when do you think we could possibly get back on that kind of track?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Gerard, I'll start. First of all, just to give an update on the unrealized loss. So from a positive standpoint, part of the hedging and activities that we do that I just talked about in prior questions really help here because we had, even though rates went up 30, 40 basis points throughout the quarter, our AOCI was fairly neutral.\nThe impact to the AOCI from the investment portfolio and pension right now is about 220 basis points versus the 10.0 that we have on Common Equity Tier 1. You're right. The Basel III Endgame and all those sorts of things, that along with, I would call, CCAR results for us are two important milestones we need to see before we make any grand declarations on what our capital ratios will be going forward.\nIn the meantime, we'll continue to build our capital levels. What we'll also do is focus on our returns. Obviously, the dividend is a large priority. An additional priority is investing in the company. We're pausing on share repurchases at this time as we build the capital. Over time, that will normalize back to kind of where we were. This is kind of that transitional period that we're in.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. And stepping back for a moment, now that the Union Bank, I assume, is fully integrated, obviously, that has been your focus since that acquisition. Can you share with us your thoughts about De Novo expansion? You had that expansion down in the Charlotte area. Is there more to come now that, again, the acquisition is behind you? What's your thoughts there as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nGerard, we're focused on building our core customer base and deepening the relationships with the customers we have through the set of products and services that we offer. We do that through a number of mechanisms. One of them is through our brand system. One of them is through our relationship managers and working together. And that De Novo effort is doing well. We also have partnerships with State Farm, which increase our distribution base.\nSo we'll continue to look at all those levers. But the bottom line is that we continue to focus on more customers, deeper relationships across the diverse set of businesses that we have. And a lot of the opportunity, Gerard, is providing more services to customers who already are customers of U.S. Bank and could benefit from some of the other products and services that we offer.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAnd Andy, just a quick follow-up on that deepening that customer relationship that you just identified. When it comes to your middle market commercial or your core commercial account, if they only have a loan relationship versus one of your preferred accounts that have multiple relationships, that deepening you just mentioned, what kind of profit differential would you estimate there is between a customer that only has a loan versus your customer that has multiple products?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nIt's significantly higher. The more relationships, the higher the return, the more revenue, certainly. So if they have a loan only versus a loan plus deposit plus treasury management plus commercial products plus payments, it all adds up.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. No, I agree. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nAgain, if you would like to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. There's obviously a lot of puts. There's obviously a lot of puts and takes as you think about the net interest margin over time. But we've seen a number of banks put out kind of this medium-term NIM target. And wondering if you have any thoughts on what a more sustainable NIM is for you guys. You talked about the security of kind of cash flowing 3 billion. I don't know if there's any kind of underwater swaps that are chunky and roll off. But I guess the question is, what do you think about NIM kind of medium-term versus where you are right now?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. I'll start here, Matt. In terms of the net interest margin, it's going to obviously track net interest income over time, but it may bounce around. Some of the drivers of that obviously could be some of the things you just mentioned, the asset churn on the investment portfolio, the creep on deposit costs, and things like that. But cash levels and liquidity mix, and things of that variety can also drive it as well. So we don't really have a call or a base of, \"Here's where our net interest margin.\" We're more focused on net interest income.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd then are there any, again, the securities book, you're pretty clear on the cash flow there. And I think that's fairly long duration from a cash flow perspective. Any swaps that we should be mindful of that could go either way looking at the next couple of years?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI'm sorry, Matt. I didn't.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nAny swaps? So again, you go ahead.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThe swap activity that we have. Yeah. So just as our hedging, while we're very active in our hedging activities, there's really no fundamental change. We continue to focus on pay fixed swaps that hedge the investment portfolio. Obviously, we took some off that impacted, but that's a temporary thing. We still have well over 30% or well over 1/3, actually, of our risk hedged on the securities book. And then we have been adding receive fixed swaps as well.\nSome of that spot, some of that forward starting, depending on the nature. As the curve has come up here and the curve has flattened and higher, that's an excellent opportunity for us to add some protection for the downside if and when that does occur. And all that adds up to be kind of that net neutral interest rate risk position that we're in.\n\nMatt O'Connor",
    "content2": "Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nI guess another one on NII. Your guidance does assume some modest reacceleration of NII in the back end. I think the second half NII is at the midpoint, 2% higher than the first half. But what's embedded in? Can you be more specific about what's embedded in the through the cycle deposit beta assumption?\nAnd John, you mentioned non-interest bearing could continue to move down a little bit from 17%. How far could what's your best guess now as to how much more deposit migration and where that ultimately could land at, and what's sort of embedded in the guidance for those measures?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. Saul, John. So on the beta side specifically, that has continued to slow. I think we're only up one or two points here this quarter. And it was three the prior quarter. So it clearly has slowed. And as I mentioned, deposit rates in the commercial side are very flat. They have not changed. Retail bounces around a little bit, but we're going to be competitive and follow the market there, of course. But all in, if you're higher for longer, it may creep up a point here too. But we feel like the low 50s is probably the right place for that to be as we kind of look forward.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nOkay. And in terms of non-interest bearing, the total liability or total deposits, where does that?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. I think that ultimately, I think, yeah, as I mentioned a little bit on the non-interest bearing side, we're at about 17%. If customers are being more efficient and things like that, it could go down a couple of points as we stay a little bit lower or at this higher for longer type period.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nOkay. Great. And I guess a follow-up on just a clarification on the deposit surge, your response to an earlier question on the deposit surge. Forgive me if I missed this, but the $15 billion to $20 billion surge, that's a normal surge in non-interest bearing deposits. But I guess the question is, what's sort of the incremental to the normal surge? What was incremental this quarter to what you normally see? I'm just trying to get a base on which to forecast non-interest bearing deposits going forward.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. So in terms of the surge, the surge in absolute terms was about $20 billion or so. It's probably $10 billion or so above and beyond what we typically see for this type of the quarter.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nOkay. Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Just kind of still a cleanup on NII. Just in very simple terms, if you're neutral to rates, why the guide lower for NII? I just want to make sure I have that straight. Did something happen that you didn't expect or you weren't fully neutral before this quarter?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Sure. Mike, it's John. So yes, we are neutral, to answer your question, to shocks to interest rates. I think what we're explaining is the behavioral aspect of it, which sometimes can be a little more challenging to judge at that point in time. And so again, it's a little bit the pace of rotation is a little bit it's slowing down, just not as much as what we had anticipated. So again, rate shocks moving up and down, we continue to feel very good from a neutral standpoint. It's just that behavioral aspect that we've been talking about here.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd do you have a number for fixed asset repricing, say, to the end of next year? Because I think that's what's driving your higher guide to the second half of this year and into next year. So you talked about $3 billion of securities. But by the end of next year, how much do you have in fixed assets that should be priced? Do you have one grand number for that?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nWell, I think the way I would think about it is about half of our loan book is fixed rate component. The other half is floating rate component. And spreads are widening. So you can see some of the floating rate components perhaps improve over time. We're seeing decent growth in payments or, excuse me, credit card. And so some of the mix is also working at play here. And so commercial loans are coming on. They're coming on at wider spreads. So that's kind of how I think about that from a big picture perspective.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd then last one, loan spreads. I mean, for a while there, it looks like we're heading to the recession and loan spreads were not widening. Now it looks like we're not having a recession, and you have tight spreads in the capital markets, and loan spreads are widening. Why are loan spreads widening now? I guess that would be an incremental positive.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So I think it's just different markets. So I think some of the drag you're seeing on the commercial volume side is capital markets spreads have been, and the access has been very good. And we saw that reflected in our fixed income capital market fees and things of that variety. And so, but I think that has taken away volume to a certain extent. In other areas where access to capital markets isn't as pronounced, I would say there has been decent opportunity for spreads there.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Hey, John, just quick follow-up to make sure we get this right. The surge deposits that came in, I think you mentioned you expect about $15 billion to leave. Is all of that going out of non-interest-bearing? So the $91 billion number, does that go into the mid-70s as we think about Q2?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nNo, some of this is temporary. So the surge that happens, it can be a mix of both money market as well as NIB. It may surge the NIB for a brief period of time, but it's not going to be material to the quarter. So even though the surge that we've been talking about can be a mix of both.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nMix of both. And so you do expect, just from a very dollar balance standpoint, NIB staying north of 80 billion. Is that fair?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. I would expect, as we said, the rotation is continuing. So I wouldn't expect growth necessarily in DDA. But deposits overall, we do expect to basically be stable.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nAnd just a separate question, given all these questions on NII, I think would love to hear the degree of conservatism baked into your NII outlook because I guess the concern you're hearing is whether we see another downward guide three months from now. And yeah, so in terms of what would go wrong in order for us to see another guide down on NII and for you to be surprised. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSenior Executive Vice President and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Ebrahim, I don't look as conservative or aggressive. It's just the range. It's just the range that we provided, just given the uncertainty that's just in the market, given all the factors that we've talked about here today.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Mr. Andersen, I turn the call back over to you.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSenior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the investor relations department if you have any follow-up questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Please wait for the next available operator.\nThank you for your patience. Please stay on the line for the next available operator.\nHi. Thank you for holding. May I have the name of your conference?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nYes, I'm here for the US Bancorp earnings call.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. For the US Bancorp. May I have your first and last name?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nSure. First name is Rachel.\nLast name Smith.\nYes. Correct.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll join you now to the conference.\nThank you.\nHello and welcome to the US Bancorp fourth quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question, please press star one again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 8:00AM Central Time. I will now turn the Conference Call over to George Anderson, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for US. Bancorp. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, US Bancorp\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good morning everyone. Today I'm joined by our Chairman, President, and CEO Andy Cecere, our Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer Terry Dolan, and our SEVP and CFO John Stern with their prepared remarks. Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty factors that could materially change.\nOur current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, our earnings release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide three. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.49, which included $0.50 per share of notable items that John will discuss in more detail. Excluding these notable items, earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, net revenue totaled $6.9 billion. For the full year we generated record net revenue of $28.3 billion. We demonstrated strength across our fee businesses, which helped to offset pressure on net interest income.\nTurning to Slide four, total loans were lower on a linked quarter basis by 1.1%, reflecting slower demand, particularly in corporate lending and continued focus on lending opportunities that meet our return hurdles.Average deposits declined compared with the third quarter as our strong funding position allowed us to be more disciplined on deposit pricing while maintaining our liquidity profile. Credit quality continued to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels this quarter and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding $49 million to our loan loss reserve as of 31 December.\nTangible book value per share increased 14.7% from a year ago and our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the year at 9.9%, an increase of 20 basis points this quarter. This ratio is 150 basis points higher than when we completed the acquisition of Union Bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. Supported by our strong capital accretion this year, the Board approved an increase to our quarterly common dividend in December to $0.49 per common share.\nSlide five provides key performance metrics. On an adjusted basis, we delivered 19.6% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter and 21.7% return on tangible common equity for the full year.Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the quarter as well as forward looking guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks Andy. Turning to Slide six, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter or $0.99 per share after adjusting for notable items. Notable items totaled $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis or $780 million net of tax, representing a $0.50 reduction per diluted common share, including an FDIC special assessment charge of $734 million offset by a benefit from tax settlements in the quarter. Other notable items this quarter included merger and integration costs of $171 million, a charitable contribution to fund our community benefits plan of $110 million, and a balance sheet optimization charge of $118 million.\nThis quarter we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment securities portfolio which we expect will enhance our net interest income trajectory while also strengthening our capital and liquidity positioning. Slide seven provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter. Turning to slide eight, we continued to manage the balance sheet prudently as we saw reduced loan demand this quarter, and the competition for deposits remained heightened as system-wide liquidity declined. Total assets ended the year at $663 billion.\nAverage loans declined 1.1% on a linked quarter basis as growth in credit card loans supported by consumer spending and low payment rates was more than offset by weaker commercial loan demand. Average deposits declined 1.9% linked quarter. Given our strong deposit balances in the third quarter, we moderated our deposit pricing somewhat in the fourth quarter even as we grew consumer deposits by 1%.During the quarter, we rebalanced a portion of our securities portfolio which provided risk-weighted asset relief and improved our overall earnings trajectory.\nThe average yield on total investment securities portfolio increased to 2.97% for the fourth quarter, a 55 basis points increase compared to a year earlier. As of December 31, the ending balance on the total investment securities portfolio was $161 billion. During the quarter, effective duration on the available-for-sale portfolio declined to less than three years as unrealized losses improved by approximately $2 billion given the movement in rates and repositioning. Turning to Slide nine, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined 3.0% linked quarter driven by a modest decline in the net interest margin of 2.78%.\nThe 3 basis points decline in the net interest margin reflected market dynamics including deposit pricing pressure and unfavorable shifts in the deposit mix partially offset by better earning asset spreads and improved total funding mix. In the first quarter of 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of $4.0 to 4.1 billion. For the full year 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter 2023 net interest income level of approximately $4.14 billion, up slightly.\nSlide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income as adjusted increased 12.1% on a year over year basis driven by new account growth and deepening relationships across the business year over year. Payments Services revenue benefited by continued strength in consumer and business spending activities while increases in trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenue were driven by underlying market activity, a full fourth quarter with Union Bank and core growth.\nTurning to slide 11, noninterest expense as adjusted decreased by 1.0% on a linked quarter basis, driven by lower compensation-related expense that was partially offset by strategic investments in marketing, and business development. Slide 12 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics trended in line with expectations, and key metrics continued to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.40% at 31 December 2023, compared with 0.35% at 30 September 2023 and 0.26% a year ago.\nThe fourth quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.49% increased 5 basis points from a third quarter level of 0.44% and was higher when compared to a fourth quarter 2022 level of 0.23% as adjusted. Turning to Slide 13, we increased our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to 9.9% as of 31 December 2023. The combination of earnings accretion net of distributions and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a 20 basis point increase. Linked quarter balance sheet optimization activities continue to have a low to neutral impact on earnings and provided additional risk transfer benefits.\nAs we move into 2024, we expect. Earnings to be in the we expect. Earnings to be the primary driver of capital accretion with limited reliance on balance sheet capital related actions. As of 31 December 2023, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains above our regulatory capital minimum by 290 basis points. Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks John, I'll end my prepared comments on Slide 14. 2023 was a turbulent year for the industry. However, we achieved a great deal, including our successful conversion of Union Bank in late May and the realization of $900 million in run rate cost synergies related to the Union Bank by year end as we had targeted. Additionally, we accomplished our goal of accelerating the accretion of CET1 capital and received full relief from Category 2 commitments we made in conjunction with the Union Bank transaction entering 2024.\nWe are positioned to continue to deliver industry leading returns on tangible common equity, are appropriately reserved for macroeconomic uncertainties, and remain confident in our strategy for future growth and expansion.\nWe are seeing positive momentum across our fee-based businesses as we deepen our most profitable client relationships and continue to target flat expense growth in 2024 even as we strategically invest in key areas and further execute on revenue growth opportunities with Union Bank. Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities, and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company. We'll now open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\nYour first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks everybody. Good morning.\nLet's see.\nHey John, I was hoping you could maybe provide a little more context around the NII thoughts for the full year. It sounds like if I did the math correctly, we're expecting somewhere between $16.5 and 16.6 billion for the full year. Maybe just some thoughts on how the margin and NII should project. I would presume maybe a little more downward pressure on NII given day count in the first quarter. But does it trough there and then sort of grow throughout the year or would there be other factors that would cause NII maybe to bleed through, you know, say middle of the year and then start to inflect back upward maybe just. Any thoughts there?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. Good morning, Scott.\nThank you.\nYou know, just maybe just to reiterate what was mentioned, in Q1 we'll see net interest income between $4.0 and 4.1 billion. You know, as we think about the full year for 2024, it's going to be consistent with our annualized Q4 number 2023 level of $4.14 billion and up slightly. You know we're using the Q4 actuals really because that we feel that's the more appropriate starting point given our balance sheet has now passed all the capital actions that took place during the 2023 calendar year.\nSo some of the color around that and some of the drivers related to how we're thinking about that as we, we do believe that DDA and low cost deposit churn into higher cost deposits are going to abate over time. You know, by the end of this quarter we'll be nine months past the last Fed hike. As an example, you know, we continue to see loan spreads improve in various categories, like in, on the commercial side of things, loan and investment portfolio asset churn continues to occur. Our loan pipelines have continued to strengthen over this quarter.\nStronger than we've seen in the past couple of quarters. And you know, we think that loan demand should be improved just given that, you know, the Fed is likely going to be in a cutting mode over time. And you know, the counter to that of course is that deposit pricing is going to be competitive, especially with QT running in some form in the background. So you know, while I'll say that first quarter NII projection is going to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter, you know, these broad factors are really going to be supportive of NII growth as we especially think half of the year.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, perfect. Thank you. Then maybe just a quick question on capital. Glad to hear that some of those balance sheet optimization efforts are beginning to sunset. Is maybe one. Do you have what you all estimate the sort of fully loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to be now, and maybe the balance between just building and potentially returning capital going forward?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah.\nSo I mean right now as you know, we're at 9.9% on CET1, you know, with the improvement in rates, the impact of the AOCI on the investment portfolio securities is about 2.2%. And so you're at 7.7%, you know, as we think about on a fully loaded basis. So if you think about it on a go forward basis, we're going to accrete capital in the area of 20 to 25 basis points per quarter. We will have a burn down on that securities book of about 30% or so relative to where it is by the end of 2025. Just to give you some context. So all that kind of adds up to building our capital to where we think it needs to be for the appropriate time given regulation and the timing of that.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, perfect. All right, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nJust maybe, John, following up on the NII question 1, sorry if I missed it. What rate cut assumptions did you have in your NII outlook? And then just talk to us about sensitivity. Are three cuts worse than six cuts? Just how we should, given market expectations around this probably is going to change week by week. I'm just trying to test the resiliency of your NII outlook if we get more or less rate cuts.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure, absolutely. So in terms of our current projections, we have four interest rate cuts by the Fed starting in Q2 of this year. Now whether or not that's two cuts or six cuts, you know, it's not going to be a material driver to our outlook. We have worked hard to get our net interest income sensitivity to be more, more or less in a neutral position. And so we feel like, you know, whether the cuts are, you know, how they're positioned are not going to be a material driver to the change of the outlook. Excuse me.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. I guess just a second question. I'm not sure if you laid out any outlook for fee revenue growth for the year in terms of if you can just talk to in terms of what you expect overall in fee revenues and particularly on payments. If you can call out expectations on what you assume for the year there. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. Yeah, I'll call a couple things on payments and some of the other fee categories. So as we think about payments, certainly in terms of merchant processing, we've put a lot of investment in there. There's a lot of technology-led advancements that we've made in terms of connections and certainly some MUB synergies. And so we continue to expect high single digits in terms of revenue growth there. The same would be said for corporate payments. We think high single digits given the amount of tech growth and client growth and all that sort of thing that we see. And then on the card side of things, we've seen a very nice margin expansion.\nMUB certainly helps, and holiday sales have been were certainly helpful this past quarter, but we see that extending, and so we think mid single digits from that standpoint. I would also reiterate, you know, we've had really very nice growth in the commercial product side. We've had particularly in 2023, we would expect high single digits there given strength we've had in foreign exchange derivatives, the fixed income capital markets, loan syndication has all been performing very well for us.\nOur trust investment management fee also should experience growth led by, you know, our institutional service businesses, corporate trust, and fund services and certainly in wealth management, some of the fees associated with that. The one thing I would point out though, in terms of service charges, we've exited our ATM cash servicing business and that was a business we decided to exit just given the high level of capital related to it in terms of intensity and investment.\nAnd so that will impact us by about $30 to 35 million per quarter starting in the first quarter.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning John.\nThanks for the color so far on the guidance. I guess similarly, can you?\nCan you walk through your within the NII expectation that you provided? Can you walk through your expectation for loan growth for the year and how you expect that could trajectory? I know you cited demand weakening, and then the same thing on the deposit front. You can maybe give us your expectation of how you think growth can look like on the, on an overall basis to maybe how the net interest, I mean the non-interest-bearing mix could.\nTrajectory from here.\nThanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure.\nSo a couple things there. So I'll start on the loan growth side. I do believe our expectations is that we will see growth in the commercial side. Of course that was a little bit weaker this last quarter as we experienced pay downs, particularly as clients were accessing capital markets and things of that nature.\nBut we've seen really a good pipeline build in that we, we expect utilization to pick up and things of that variety. So we feel like that along with credit cards will be good sources of growth for us as we think about loan growth going forward. On the deposit side, as a reminder, we'll probably be lower in the first quarter. We seasonally lose deposits just as we kind of go through the year end.\nProcess. Just given the mix of our businesses, deposits end up being a little bit lower in the first quarter. But then we see more or less stabilization. But there might be some headwinds there, particularly depending on QT and how the Fed's draining of liquidity out of the system will impact the numbers there.\nAnd then going into your NIB comment, you know, we've seen of course rotation out of NIB into other interest-bearing products that continues but starts to wane as we go throughout the year. And you know, again as I mentioned, we're going to be nine months by the end of this quarter past the last Fed hike. And that gives us some signal that that will begin to abate.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, thank you for that. And then I guess, you know, if you could help us just think about how we should think about the magnitude of operating leverage that's reasonable as you look at next year. You know, I know we do have some color on how you're thinking about NII, fees, and then put that against your efforts to keep expenses stable. But I guess if you could just maybe frame it as a range of operating leverage that you think is reasonable as we look at next year.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nGood morning, John, this is Andy. Let me start with this and John can add on. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to benefit from the cost efficiencies of the Union deal to total $900 million. That is fully reflected now and in the run rate starting this quarter. We were achieving those benefits because of the benefits of technology investments we've made, digital investments, operational investments, our risk platform. That is the benefit of the investments we've made. We would expect to continue to invest in the business, in those capabilities and payments and technology modernization.\nWe are also very cognizant in managing expenses very closely. We still have opportunities in terms of efficiencies in personnel, in operations, and activities around technology that will allow us to more efficiently deliver the services we have.\nSo I would expect as we get towards the second half of the year that when we start to see that margin growth that John talked about as well as the fee normalization, that we would have opportunity for positive operating leverage. And we're going to again, that is our long-term objective as always, and we have levers to pull.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, John.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi. Good morning.\nI was wondering if you could give.\nA little color on what you saw this quarter in credit quality, on the NPA movement, particularly in commercial. And then also, John, maybe just some thoughts on the potential charge-off trajectory as you see things migrate from NPA.\nNet charge-offs this year.\nWhat we should be thinking about.\nThank you.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, good morning, John.\nThis is Terry Dolan. So I'm going to take this question related to credit quality. Your first one was really related to non-performing assets. You know, some of the things that we saw in the fourth quarter, you know, if you end up going across the portfolio, generally pretty stable. We know we did see a couple of idiosyncratic.\nLoans that went into non-performing status.\nBoth of those were kind of Union legacy sort of credits. So continue to kind of work through that. But I would also say that both of those are fairly well collateralized. So you know, we don't necessarily see a lot of charge-off content related to those idiosyncratic credits.\nWhen we look at net charge-offs in the trajectory, you know, I would expect that or we would expect that, you know, it'll continue to kind of normalize. You know, credit card is kind of getting closer to pre-pandemic levels, but you know, that will continue to move up a little bit. You know, our expectation is that, you know, for full year 2024 we'll probably be in kind of in the mid-50s in terms of the net charge-off rate.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, thanks Terry. And then John or Andy, just on.\nThe fee revenues, John ticked off on.\nThe fee revenues, a number of high single digit kind of potential growers in 2024.\nHow do we think about kind of, you know, the ability to grow total?\nFee revenues and what kind of base should we use for that? It looks like maybe the adjusted base for 2020 was about $10.8 billion of fee revenues.\nIs that something you can grow off of that? Just trying to contextualize, you know, total.\nRevenue last year was around $28 billion. You know, how should we think about the ability to grow revenues on fees?\nMaybe total revenues this year?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, so I mean we had, as you mentioned, some of the fee numbers there. You know, from a core fee perspective, we do expect to grow. So I ticked off some of the areas in terms of payments, commercial products, trust, and all that sort of thing. You know, other. And you know, some of the service charges components there. Of course, you know, in terms of mortgage, you know, that will be probably somewhat in the flat range. And you know, in terms of other, we had a little bit of a high number in terms of the Q4 related to tax credit.\nRelated impact, finance.\nSyndication fees and things like that. So, you know, all those things, and we expect kind of that, you know, that mid single in terms of the fee components going forward for this year.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay.\nKind of a mid single from that 10.8 adjusted base.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Erica.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nMorning. My first question is for you, Andy. You know, you know, clearly you went through it in terms of, you know, some capital consternation in 2023, and now you're sitting here with 9.9 CET1, no longer have to be a Category 2 bank early. All the color that we're getting from Washington is that Basel III endgame will be at least delayed, if not softened significantly. As you think about maybe just one more hurdle ahead over the near term, in terms of the DFAST, how are you thinking about where USB's proper CET1 ratio is in terms of, you know, the minimum?\nLooking forward to, you know, a future where maybe capital is a little bit tighter, but, you know, you're also growing and do you feel like you're now on offense and all the sort of the balance sheet management that was designed to optimize capital is fully behind you?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, Erika, as John mentioned, I think our balance sheet optimization efforts are behind us. Our focus on capital accretion will be from earnings as we go into 2024 and forward. As we talked about, we're at a 9.9% CET1 ratio today. You know, a couple years ago our target was between 8.5 and 9.\nSo we're above that target. But we're also cognizant of the rules that are coming both from the perspective of Basel III Endgame, which is still uncertain as you talked about, as well as CCAR and how that will evolve over time. So we will continue to accrete the 20 to 25, we'll continue to burn down the AOCI when we get clarity on the capital rules. Both Basel III Endgame and CCAR will then determine what the proper capital target will be.\nMy expectation is we'll be above the 9% that we were a few years ago, but we'll define that, refine that, and then we'll get into what the math is around buybacks at that time.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. And one follow up question for you, John. Thank you for giving us some of the components of the, you know, the NII. I'm just wondering, you know, as you mentioned, QT, are you generally expecting, you know, deposits to be down, total deposits to be down, even if DDA mix shift abates? And also how quickly do you think the deposit betas on the way down can react to each Fed rate cut?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. So the first part of your question, in terms of QT, you know, we do anticipate QT to be throughout the year. And so that's going to, on the whole, put pressure on deposits throughout the year in terms of balances. And so, you know, we don't expect a lot of growth overall in deposits, but well, you know, we have ways to manage through that.\nOf course, you know, they're talking through, you know, various ways to change the QT, but, you know, that just remains to be seen. You know, in terms of deposits performance on the way down, you know, I anticipate, you know, commercial and wholesale type balances will go down just as fast as they would come up. On the retail side, it's going to be more of an arc.\nIt'll take some time for that to turn, but those are our expectations.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nHey, good morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSo I wasn't clear. Are you guiding for flat, positive, or negative operating leverage or none of the above for 2024 and more generally? I mean, the real question is when do you get back to your historical efficiency ratio? I think you talked about this at a presentation in December. I mean, 61% core efficiency in the fourth quarter isn't exactly like legacy US Bancorp.\nAnd that's up 300 basis points year over year, and earlier last decade you were 55%. Going back further, you were the low 50s. Is that just aspirational target now or is that a real target over the next two years or so? And along those lines, I guess you have all the savings you're going to get from Union Bank. So where does the rest come from here?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, Mike, it's probably more likely a positive operating leverage in H2 2024 versus H1 2024, given some of the margin pressures that we talked about. That is still our objective. My expectation is once we get more to our normalized revenue level, that we will continue to manage expenses below revenue growth and continue to take down that efficiency ratios into the 50s. That's the way we're planning.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nWhen you, when you say into the 50s, I mean, is it something, can you get back to 55%? Is that in your planning horizon, even going out a few more years? And it looks like the payments business is recatching its stride here. And along those lines, I didn't see the slide anymore on the payments business combined with small business banking.\nYou were going to grow small business relationships by 15% to 20% and the revenues by 25% to 30%. I don't see any slide for that. And I know you got. Look, you got the Union Bank deal. You had the issues of last March and April, and it's okay. Your capital's back, the deal's done, and now we're back to kind of US Bancorp business as usual. So, I'm just trying to look for some color on that, you know, if you're going to become the square of banking or that's still a goal, and how those revenues might help you improve that efficiency.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nSure, Mike, and it is still a goal. We do think this combination of payments and business banking and providing that comprehensive product set and capabilities to help people run their business is a key strategic priority. It continues to be. And I think the B categories that John mentioned are also a key driver of revenue, including payments, commercial products, trust, and investment.\nAnd those are all areas that we expect continued growth on. The immediate pressure on net interest income is what's causing us not to get positive operating leverage in the short term, but it is something that I believe and as John mentioned, will abate and start to grow into the second half of 2024. And so I think we're going to get to the positive operating leverage. We are planning on it, and we will continue to drive that efficiency ratio down, certainly into the high 50s at the beginning, and continue to deliver positive operating leverage to get it even lower. That's our objective.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Matt.\n\nMatt O'connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutshe Bank\n\nHi, good morning. Just to clarify, the flat expense guidance for 2024 is also the adjusted level 2023 of 17.0?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThat's correct.\n\nMatt O'connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutshe Bank\n\nOkay.\nI assume that includes any expense benefit from the exit of an ATM cash business that you referenced earlier?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nCorrect, yes.\n\nMatt O'connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutshe Bank\n\nOkay. Then just stepping back, like any other.\nKind of small businesses or segments that you're kind of reevaluating for, not so much kind of the regulatory proposals, which we'll see how they finalize, but just other areas that you're stepping back and whether it's a mortgage, given a smaller market there, or other parts of the business portfolio that you're looking either to exit or to potentially lean into, that's a bit different than you were thinking, say six months ago.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nWell, I can start and Andy can chime in. You know, I think, you know, we commented on the ATM business. I mean, you're constantly evaluating certain things, particularly in the light of regulatory change. Clearly, you know, a lot of comment letters have been submitted in terms of the Basel III Endgame.\nYou know, at the end of the day, it's not going to materially drive, you know, whether we exit or businesses or enter new businesses, that sort of thing. It's just going to be a combination of continual investment, as Andy mentioned, in terms of what we need to do toward achieving positive operating leverage and managing around regulatory actions. Those would be some of the comments I'd throw out there.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nI think I agree, John. The only thing I'd add is the environment and the competitive dynamic is something that causes us to be more aggressive or less aggressive in certain categories. Maybe the example I'll give you is auto lending, which for us is not growing right now. That's because of the spreads and the returns are just not at our levels that we want to put on the books. So those are areas that we're going to not get out of or close down, but just not emphasize in terms of growth at the levels of returns that we're seeing right now.\n\nMatt O'connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutshe Bank\n\nOkay. And then, specifically in credit card, you know, we're obviously seeing the normalization of losses with you guys and throughout the industry, and also very strong growth. So, if we adjust losses kind of on a lag basis, you know, they are above a few years ago. You know, at what point do you tighten up credit card and say, you know, we should slow growth at this point in the cycle, or do you think there's still quite a bit of runway of, call it, good growth or healthy growth?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, well, I mean, it is an area, Matt, that we think that there continues to be nice growth in that particular space. You know, it is an area, though, that, you know, certainly as we have looked, you know, the economic uncertainties and those sorts of things, the pressure on consumers, especially, you know, given the inflationary sort of pressure, you know, we on the margin, around the edges, you know, we do make adjustments to underwriting, you know, and tighten that up where we need to.\nYeah. You know, but when you end up kind of thinking about the overall or, you know, credit performance of credit cards business, we still, you know, think it's a very nice business. We focus on prime, super prime sort of customers. And, you know, even through this cycle, I think it's going to perform very well.\n\nMatt O'connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutshe Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, Andy. Good morning, John.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJohn, you touched on in answering a question about commercial loan growth that some of your customers were accessing in capital markets and things of that nature. Can you guys share with us? We read a lot and see a lot about the private credit markets have really become quite active and aggressive in making loans to corporate and commercial customers.\nAre you guys seeing that competition, number one, and also is it any different than, you know, past years or has it intensified? And then simultaneously, are any of these private, you know, Apollo, Blackstone, et cetera, customers of yours? And if they are, how do you balance the competition versus handling their needs?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. This is John Gerard. So, you know, in terms of, on the commercial side, you know, when I comment that going to the capital markets, it's more or less the public market. So, you know, taking bond issuance in the public investment grade market, you know, we tend not to see them or compete on the private credit side of things. It's just not a structure or type of loan type in terms of our client base that we tend to run into.\nSo, it's more or less. I can't say it's increased or decreased versus because we just don't see those names.We compete in the commercial space with our peer banks more or less in that particular venue. You know, in terms of, you mentioned, in terms of client interaction, we have great relationships with a number of different.Names in terms of investment services, capital markets activities, other sorts of categories. So we do have some very nice relationships with those institutions.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, our corporate trust and global fund services. Gerard, as John mentioned, businesses, they support a number of large private credit funds in the industry, and they are customers and clients of ours that we continue to serve.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, US Bancorp\n\nI think the last thing I would just add is that, depending upon where the capital rules end up and what sort of where the emphasis is or isn't, you could see more or less moving into the private.capital markets. You know, they tend to have more flexibility in terms of structure. They take on more risk, you know, all sorts of things. Again, may not be, you know, where we compete, but certainly from an industry standpoint, you know, private credit continues to be, you know, an area of focus.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOh, thank you, Terry. Just if we step back for a moment and look at, you know, beyond Basel III Endgame, maybe we do get the final proposal in the middle of this year or later this year, we get through the next DFAST, US Bancorp has always had a hallmark of having one of the highest ROTCEs amongst the regional banks.\nObviously you're probably going to maintain that, but you also were very disciplined in giving back the excess capital every year to shareholders in buybacks and dividends generally, if I recall correctly, around 75% to 80% of total earnings in the combination of both.Andy, do you see that coming on the horizon maybe 2025 once we get all the rules set, we know where your CET1 ratio needs to be? What's your outlook there?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, Gerard, you know we do achieve a high return on tangible common equity I mentioned 19% to 20% fourth quarter, first full year 2024. And as we think about going forward, I would expect us to continue to lead the pack in terms of that return which is key to generating capital, too key to returning capital. And again, once we get clarity on the rules, as I mentioned earlier, in both the Basel III Endgame as well as the CCAR process and determine our target capital levels, we will return the difference either through dividends or buybacks, as has been our history.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good, appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks.\nGood morning. To follow up on the deposit side, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about starting to moderate pricing a little bit, and you also talked about roll off of higher cost deposits. Just wondering if you can amplify both of those comments? So what types of products or tweaks are you already being able to make on the deposit pricing front? And then where did those higher cost deposits flow out of from a business perspective?\nThanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks Ken. You know, the comment was really around, you know, in terms of the fourth quarter and just what we saw. Maybe just stepping back a bit, in the third quarter, we grew deposits quite a bit and part of that was, you know, we were just getting through the Union Bank acquisition. We wanted to make sure we were maintaining strong relationships with those clients and really all clients as we were going through those times. In the fourth quarter, given where loan demand went and where we had a little bit of excess of deposits, we made decisions really just tactically to.\nGoing away from non-deposit or non-relationship or less relationship-based and specifically in time deposits declining and things of that nature. So I think that's just going to be the ebb and flow of things of just how we manage it going forward, depending on loan growth, depending on our profile, and depending on the relationship. So that's really what that count was intended for.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAnd importantly, John, on our core consumer deposits, we are continuing to see growth there as you mentioned, as we had in the slide.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYep. We continue to expect core deposit growth on the consumer side, and that has been something we've been, the team has been very focused on, and we feel that we've had great success there.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. And as a follow-up to the UB point, is everything from UB now fully baked, whether it's the cost, actions, and structure and also that stability, you know, kind of making sure you're buttoned up? As a starting point, have that base of loans and deposits gotten to a steady state as well?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYes.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, so we just move forward with everything and listen to the guide comments.\nThat you gave earlier.\nOkay, got it.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThank you.\nExactly. It's all in the core now. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nAgain, if you would like to ask a question, press star. Then the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, HSBC\n\nHey, good morning guys. Maybe on the payment side, if you just add a little bit more detail about how you're feeling about your payment strategy and, you know, how you're doing and how much, how big the upside opportunity is there. Obviously, you're growing nicely on the issuing side, the merchant acquiring side, you know, sort of mid-single-digit growth in revenues and volumes.\nI think you said high-single-digit next year. I mean, as you guys know, the banks have ceded a lot of share to software companies, to integrated service providers. And just how do you feel it's going in terms of integrating your commercial banking and payments offering? And it does, because it does seem like you have a major advantage in terms of having relationships both on the retail and commercial side.\nThen you know, obviously, you know, you kind of have that two-sided network that a lot of the fintechs want. Obviously banks have struggled in this area. Just maybe if you can just give us sort of an overview of how you're doing and how you feel the opportunity set is evolving.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYes. So you know, first of all, the high single digits on merchant processing is a function of the investments we've made and the initiatives we have underway. And I would highlight two things. Number one is our tech-led initiative which is now over 30% of our activities related to tech-led. So that is integrating our merchant processing capabilities into the software that people use to run their businesses. And number two is this whole integration of banking and payments that we talked about earlier.\nThe advantage I do believe that we have is that we are not just providing one single service. We are integrating banking, banking services, deposit lending capabilities, treasury management, together with payments and money movement into one comprehensive offering that helps people again run their business, particularly small businesses, and helps them ease into the process of payment activity in a comprehensive way together with the software they're using to run their company.\nThose are the initiatives that we have underway, and that continues to be a huge focus and one that I do think differentiates us a little bit because of the capabilities we have in payments. That's true of merchant processing, corporate payments, as well as retail issuing.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, HSBC\n\nOkay, got it. That's helpful. Maybe I'll just follow up on deposits. You know, you mentioned that the migration; you expect the migration out of non interest bearing deposits to sort of run its course. Just when and where do you see that? I think non interest bearing was about 17.5% of total deposits. How much more room is there, and just on deposit cost? I think the cumulative beta of my calculations right is around 49%. How much more room is there for that to increase? Sort of, what's embedded in your guidance for NII?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. So in terms of the NII, I.\nThink we've talked quite a bit about.\nAnd I would just, you know, I mean, we're at a certain percentage that you mentioned, and you know, we're going to be around that area. It certainly could drift a little lower. But we are at a point where, from a core standpoint, particularly on the commercial and small business side, where you're starting to get into places where companies have to run operating accounts, and over time you're going to have account growth and things of that variety. So I think they'll be conducive to supporting NII going forward. But there will be some leftover churn, as I alluded to earlier in the call, in terms of beta. As you mentioned, you know, 48.5% or so is our beta right now.\nI think it can creep up as we've kind of talked about, you know, but it's going to depend on when the Fed cuts is going to be kind of that focus point in terms of how much it will go from here. And so, you know, what level is hard to predict. But you know, we, there'll be pressure until the Fed starts cutting.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, HSBC\n\nOkay, got it, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, I turn the call back over to you.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Sarah, and thank you for listening to our Earnings Call. Please contact the investor relations department if you have any follow up questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's Conference Call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

If you would like to ask a question, please press one, then zero on your phone. If you'd like to withdraw, please press one, then zero again. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 9:00AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for US Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, US Bancorp\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, and John Stern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During their initial prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.\nPlease note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that can materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, our press release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.91, which included $0.14 per share of notable items related to merger and integration charges. Excluding those notable items, we delivered earnings per share of $1.05 for the quarter. Third quarter results were highlighted by linked quarter and year-over-year fee revenue growth that benefited from our acquisition of Union Bank, deepening client relationships, and strong underlying business activity.\nWe are achieving the cost synergies we anticipated from Union Bank and continue to prudently manage core expense as we identify operational efficiencies across the business. As of 30 September, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.7%, an increase of 60 basis points this quarter. This is the same level it was prior to our acquisition of Union Bank.\nTotal average deposits increased 3%, or $15 billion, on a linked quarter basis. Credit quality continues to normalize this quarter in line with expectations, and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding $95 million to our loan loss reserve, reflective of an evolving credit environment. On 16 October, the Federal Reserve granted us full relief from certain category two commitments made in connection with the Union Bank acquisition, given our balance sheet reduction and capital actions.\nAs a result, we are now subject to existing capital rules or, if adopted, the same transition rules as all other category three banks related to enhanced capital requirements under the Basel III Endgame Proposal. As proposed, this would include a three-year transition period for the expanded risk-based approach and AOCI regulatory capital adjustments starting in third quarter 2025. I will discuss the impacts of this decision further in my closing remarks.\nSlide four provides income statement results as reported and on an adjusted basis, ending in average balances and other key metrics. Slide five provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was 1.04%, and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. While net interest margin declined nine basis points to 281 this quarter, in line with our expectations, we continue to expect the NIM to bottom in the fourth quarter as we reach the end of the current rate hiking cycle.\nTurning to slide six, a great benefit of our business model includes a balance between our spread and fee income businesses that helps us reduce earnings volatility through a business cycle. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income grew approximately 12%. Within payment services, we continue to invest in our digital capabilities, expanding our payments ecosystem and optimizing our distribution.\nEmphasis on expanded partnerships and integrated capabilities will continue to support tech-led growth across merchant processing and increase opportunities across other areas of our payment services businesses. Additionally, we are continuing to make investments that leverage our scale and strategic market positioning across our corporate trust, mortgage banking, and capital markets businesses, which should enhance our already strong annualized growth trajectories. Slide seven highlights a few of our many post-conversion revenue opportunities and expected cost synergies with Union Bank.\nEarly indications of the potential to deepen relationships with legacy Union Bank loyal, affluent, and diversified client base are promising, and we continue to be on track to realize approximately $900 million in cost synergies, which we expect to be fully reflected in our run rate as we head into the year 2024. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the balance sheet and results for the quarter.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. Turning to slide eight, we ended the quarter with total average assets of $664 billion and total average loans of $377 billion, down $9 and $12 billion, respectively, on a linked quarter basis as we prudently managed and optimized our balance sheet given the current macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Average total deposits were $512 billion, representing a 3% increase linked quarter, driven by expected seasonality and growth in money market and time deposits, time deposit accounts.\nSpecifically, average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $16.2 billion this quarter, primarily driven by our Union Bank retail customer upgrade at conversion from non-interest-bearing checking accounts to our interest-bearing Bank Smartly product. Excluding this reclassification, the decrease would have been $6.2 billion. Our mix of non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was approximately 19%, consistent with where we expect the mix shift to stabilize based on historical performance and the operational nature of our core deposit base.\nSlide nine provides an update on the investment securities portfolio. As of 30 September, our available-for-sale securities were 97% of our total securities. We continue to reduce the effective duration of the AFS portfolio, which is now less than three and a half years. On slide ten, we provide a detailed earnings summary for the quarter. This quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.91, or $1.05 per share after adjusting for merger and integration charges of $213 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted common share. Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.3 billion, which represented a 4.1% decrease on a linked quarter basis, and a 10.7% increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates and the acquisition of Union Bank.\nOur net interest margin declined nine basis points to 2.81% in third quarter. The linked quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of lower earning assets, deposit pricing, and mix shift, offset somewhat by better loan spreads and funding mix. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Fee income increased 11.9%, or $295 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher payment service revenue, trust and investment management fees, commercial products, and mortgage banking revenues. On a linked quarter basis, fee income increased 1.4%, or $38 million, driven by other revenues, which included servicing revenue from previously executed balance sheet optimization actions. Turning to slide 13, reported non-interest expense for third quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which included $284 million of merger and integration-related charges.\nNon-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $13 million, or 0.3%, on a linked quarter basis, driven by lower compensation expense that was somewhat offset by our investments in marketing and business development. Slide 14 shows our credit quality performance this quarter. While asset quality metrics reflecting changing conditions in the commercial real estate office segment, results this quarter continued to trend in line with our expectations, and key metrics remained below pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, given the higher interest rate environment, as well as other portfolio considerations, we increased our reserve ratio for commercial real estate office loans to 10%. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.35% at 30 September, compared with 0.29% at 30 June and 0.20% a year ago.\nOur third quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.44% increased nine basis points from a second quarter level of 0.35%, as adjusted, and was higher when compared to a third quarter 2022 level of 0.19%. Our allowance for credit losses as of 30 September totaled $7.8 billion, or 2.08% of period-end loans. Turning to slide 15, we continue to take action to improve our capital ratios this quarter, increasing our CET1 ratio to 9.7% as of 30 September.\nThe combination of our debt-to-equity conversion with MUFG, earnings accretion net of distributions, and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a 60 basis point increase from last quarter. Importantly, our CET1 capital ratio is now 270 basis points above our regulatory capital minimum. I will now provide fourth quarter forward-looking guidance on slide 16. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income of between $4.1 and 4.2 billion.\nTotal revenue, as adjusted, is estimated to be in the range of $6.8 to 6.9 billion, including approximately $65 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately $4.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $115 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank acquisition. On a core basis, we expect full year 2024 expenses to be flat with 2023. Our income tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. We expect merger and integration charges of between $250 to 300 million in the fourth quarter. I'll now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, John. Turning to slide 17, the Federal Reserve notified us on 16 October that they have granted us full relief from Category II commitments made in conjunction with the Union Bank acquisition after considering several factors, including actions to reduce our risk profile, strengthen our capital position, and provisions related to Category III rules made after we received approval on the Union Bank acquisition. This important decision now subjects us to the same enhanced capital requirements as all other Category III banks, including a three-year phasing of AOCI into regulatory capital starting in Q3 2025. As expected, we will continue to carefully balance the need to accrete capital with any potential impact to earnings from further balance sheet optimization activities. Measures to manage the interest rate sensitivity and duration of our available for sale securities will continue.\nSince before our acquisition of Union Bank, our priority has been and will continue to be the strategic execution of capital-efficient growth opportunities across each of our business lines. As a result of the Fed's decision, we are now well-positioned with our enhanced earnings profile and diversified business mix to increase our capital levels, continue our disciplined lending activities, and further strengthen our balance sheet. Let me close by thanking our more than 75,000 employees for their dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities, and shareholders. We'll now open up the call to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have a question, please press one, then zero on your phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press one, then zero again. Once again, if you have a question, please press one and then zero on your phone. And then go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. I guess maybe the first question just around the Fed decision. In its letter, the Fed said, I guess the bank anticipates taking further actions to reduce risk profile and reduce assets and increase capital. So if you don't mind talking about just what additional actions we should expect, I think you mentioned that the EPS impact could be neutral from here. But just how should we think about what else the Fed expects from you on the risk mitigation side as we move forward into next year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. Thanks, Ebrahim. Good morning. So this is John. As a way of background, the Fed granted us, as you mentioned, full relief from our Category II commitments, and that's because of the actions, and Andy mentioned this, of our actions to reduce risk as well as our ability to strengthen our capital position. So importantly, this is going to provide us additional time and flexibility to meet those new regulatory requirements and do so in the same timeframe as our Category III peers. And additionally, we think it's going to reduce the downside risk given a challenging rate environment. But nothing really changes in terms of how we're fundamentally managing the balance sheet going forward. We're still committed to building regulatory capital. We're still expecting to increase and accrete capital at 20 to 25 basis points on average per quarter.\nOur expectation is to accelerate that as we get through the merger-related costs or be on the high end of that range, I should say, as we get through the merger-related costs and start to realize the full Union Bank synergies. We're still going to be executing risk-weighted asset optimization transactions, but now we have the time and flexibility to do that in a way that is low to neutral in terms of our earnings impact. So for all those reasons, we feel like we have the flexibility in our balance sheet to do those sorts of things.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nI think that's exactly right, John. The only thing I'd add is part of this decision is reflective of what we've already done for the last 12 months in terms of reducing the risk profile, building capital, optimizing the balance sheet. I want to be clear, Ebrahim, we are not under an asset cap at all. We are maintaining flexibility and managing the balance sheet and capital, and we'll continue to remain focused on capital-efficient growth. That includes focusing on high-margin, high-return businesses that exceed our cost of capital while deepening relationships from our most profitable clients. That has been and will continue to be our focus.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThat's good color. Thank you. And just a separate question, John. I think I heard you correctly. If I heard you correctly, you mentioned you expect the NIM to drop, and I'm assuming NIM equals NII to drop in fourth quarter. Maybe just change that assumption in terms of, does a steeper yield curve or a widening in just the curve risk that assumption around troughing of NII or NIM? And what gives you confidence around mixed-shared consumer behavior to feel good about that?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah. So I think in terms of the guidance we provided, we have embedded in there our rate forecast, which includes a rate increase in December. Whether or not that happens or not is relatively immaterial since we're fairly neutral from an interest rate risk positioning standpoint. I guess what I would say is, as the Fed is continuing, whether they're done or not in terms of the rate hiking, we start to see a lot of the things on the deposit side slow down. So our non-interest-bearing balances will be relatively stable here at this level. The deposit betas and the rate paid will start to slow down. And then on the other side, your assets will start to reprice, whether that's the securities book, the loan book, and all those sorts of things.\nSo that's what gives us the confidence, really, that we will bottom out here in fourth quarter from a NIM and net interest income perspective.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nGood morning, John.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, John. Hi, good morning. John, could I just follow up on what you were just talking about? What are you looking at in terms of the NIM for fourth quarter, roughly? And did I hear correctly, you think the deposit mix kind of settles out around 19, 20 where you are here and beta kind of in the mid-40s? You still have those expectations?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah, maybe just to go up the last couple of questions you mentioned. So from a non-interest-bearing, yes, we do expect that mix. We're at about 19%. That's about where we will be. We expect that to be in that range. And from a beta perspective, we are in the mid-40s right now. It's possible it could creep up higher depending on where the Fed goes from here, but we feel good about that. And then in terms of the net interest margin and things like that, we do anticipate a little bit more pressure here in the fourth quarter, but then that really is the point where we feel that it'll bottom out based on my comments I just made on the previous question.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThat's reflected in our revenue and net interest income guidance.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And then, recognizing with the Fed decision, you've obviously got a lot more time to phase in the AOCI now. John, could you just give us a little more color on what happened in terms of the trend in AOCI this quarter? What are the pieces there? And how do the swaps affect your burn-down timeline? And just also, if you could add on, how do you calculate the capital with AOCI today? Looks like maybe around 7%, something like that.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah. So I think all in, it's about AOCI; it's about 250 basis points of impact. So I would say 7.2 is probably roughly kind of where I would think about it. In terms of the change in the AFS, obviously, rates backed up on the long end of the curve, 75 to 90 basis points depending on treasuries or mortgages that you're looking at.\nAnd that had an impact of about $1.4 billion on an after-tax basis on our AFS securities book, which we would have expected and is consistent with the duration of our book, which we have continued to wind down, as I mentioned in our comments, about less than three and a half years is our current duration. So that's the effect of that. We are continuing to see. We will continue to see paydowns in that book, whether it's HTM or AFS. We have about approximately $3 billion or so per quarter that rolls off that book, and we'll reinvest in the AFS side of things over time.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning. Morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nJust to be clear, how much of the $900 million merger savings were recognized in the Q3 results?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nWell, in terms of we will get to a full run rate of $900 million. It's probably $100 million or so is kind of in that range is probably what we were seeing. But it's been growing in terms of the amount, and we'll see that full benefit full through in the fourth quarter.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nRelative to the third quarter, the first quarter of 2025 could see $800 million of additional expense savings?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nNo, because we've seen the savings have been generated all throughout the course of the year. And they accelerate third quarer into fourth quarter and all that, second quarter, third quarer into fourth quarter.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nSo what's the cumulative merger savings? I guess how much more expense savings should there be when they're fully realized in the first quarter relative to the third quarter?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nWhen we have the savings, we will have approximately $400 or so million that has gone through this full year. Then we'll expect to see that in the next coming year. That's embedded into our full year guidance of flat expenses between 2023 and 2024.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nSo Mike, the way I think about it, this is Andy, by the end of fourth quarter, we will be on a run rate recognizing $900 million of savings, which will be fully reflected in 2024 in our expense base. That is consistent with how we think about a relatively flat 2023 to 2024 expense base, including those savings plus investments we'll continue to make in the business.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThen the big question then is, so if you have flat 2024 expenses, do you think you can get to positive operating leverage, or is it too early, or too many moving parts? Because this is the sweet spot of the merger savings coming up, right, by the next quarter.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nIt is a sweet spot, Mike. You're absolutely right. The savings are great. The opportunities to deepen relationships on the Union Bank customer base, I mentioned that in my comments. I think that is terrific. Our fee businesses are doing extremely well. On a year-over-year basis, it was up 12% across almost every category. Frankly, very little of that was related to Union Bank.\nThat was just core improvement across a number of categories: capital markets, our corporate and trust, our fee businesses, and our payments businesses. The challenge for us and for the entire industry is net interest income and margin. In this environment, that's the one that there's a lot of moving pieces, as you say. Loan growth is relatively tepid as we speak for us and for the industry overall. It'll be dependent upon that in terms of positive operating leverage. I would say it's too early to call.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. And last follow-up. Your increase in CET1 ratio due to a lot of balance sheet optimization did come at a cost of less assets, less loan growth, less earnings, right? There's a trade-off in that. So now that you're under kind of less pressure and have so much more flexibility, do you think you can be a little bit more lax in terms of your growth? And in turn, that may help NII, or is that too much of a stretch?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah. We have flexibility now in terms of the transactions that we do to optimize. We still have plans to do those sorts of things. We've identified some things that are going to be relatively neutral and a little bit on the low end of earnings impact. Of course, you saw some of those transactions in second quarter flow through in terms of provision and things like that. That did lower our earning assets, as you mentioned, about $8 billion or thereabouts this quarter.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, John.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nMorning. I know despite the regulatory change around the Category II requirement, you maintain the 20 to 25 basis points generation in CET1 quarterly. Why no change there? Can you just talk to us maybe about the give and take in that expectation as the need to meet the Category II shifted to Category III? Why no change there?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nWell, I think there's no change because we feel like, given the new rule set and things like that, over time, we'll have to transition into the new regime, which will include AOCI and so all the other rules. And so we're going to be in a mode to continue to accrete that capital. And that 20 to 25 basis points is our earnings stream that we will accrete. And right, like this quarter, for example, is 20 basis points, but we anticipate going to 25, or on the higher end of that range as we get through the merger-related costs and we have the union synergies.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nOkay. So the less BSO activities didn't materially benefit that expectation?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nI'm sorry. Can you say that more? I couldn't hear you.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThe less risk-weighted asset optimization efforts that would be needed now under the need to meet Category III did not materially impact the 20 to 25 basis points of earnings generation expected.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nNo, that did not. No, that did not. And for example, this quarter, we had 20 basis points of RWA actions, which included some of the asset reduction. You saw our earning assets lower, for example, as well as some other transactions embedded. So we separate out the core earnings when we were talking about 20 to 25 basis points, core earnings from other RWA optimization transactions that we have the ability to do.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nOkay. And then separately, is there any OpEx impact of now needing to conform to the Category III versus the more immediate requirements of Category II? Anything on the expense side? And then separately, on your margin bottoming comment, anything in terms of the trajectory and the margin that you would expect after you see this bottoming as we head into 2024? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah. So in terms of OpEx, no, there's no further investment. You may recall before tailoring, we had many of the same rules and standards that we had in terms of liquidity rules, reporting, and all those sorts of things. So we have all the capabilities built up or can quickly get to that level from an operational standpoint. So there's no worries there. In terms of the net interest margin, we mentioned just a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and then bottoming out, likely stable, but it'll still depend on interest rates, quite frankly, at that particular point in time.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, John.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we'll go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Oh, one moment here. We'll move past that. Pardon me. We'll go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, guys. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just as it relates to sort of the balance sheet growth dynamic, so great to see you out of that Fed restriction. Do you see any risk that you'd exceed $700 billion in assets organically or come into contact with any of the other Category II restrictions organically in a timeframe that would subject you to Category II rules before your peers would have to get there under new levels? In other words, I'm just trying to kind of make sure that this is indeed just a full, free, and clear. So just curious your thoughts there.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nIt is. As Andy mentioned, there's no asset cap, so we have complete flexibility here on our balance sheet going forward. So if we elect to grow or want to grow, and we do want to grow in a capital-efficient manner, we will do so. What I would say, though, is that we're going to be emphasizing higher return loans and de-emphasizing lower return type of assets. And I think that will manifest itself in the balance sheet churns. And in addition to that, I would just highlight that in this environment right now, the loan outlook is pretty low. The demand for loans is quite low given a number of different reasons out there. But that gives us kind of the confidence that we have more time and flexibility here.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then I think you might have touched on this in an earlier question, but maybe if you can sort of rewalk us through sort of that AOCI burndown and cash flow expectations coming off both the AFS and HTM books. And then I think you might have given the duration of the AFS book, but do you have that for the HTM book as well?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. So in terms of the AFS and HTM, we're at about, in terms of balances, about $162 billion or so. And it's about a 50/50 mix, as we mentioned on the call, in terms of AFS and HTM. So we have about, as I mentioned, $3 billion of runoff per quarter on average, just given the current interest rate environment and things of that variety. In terms of our profile, we've been able to hedge about 30% of the fixed-rate portion of the AFS book. And so that's what has driven the duration of that particular book in the less than three and a half years, as we have the HTM book is principally all agency mortgage-backed securities, which have longer lives. And so it's more in the six or so, six and a half range in terms of the duration of that book.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. All right. Wonderful. Thank you, guys, for taking the question.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Erica.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nGood morning.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nAndy, my first question is for you. Clearly, yesterday's announcement is a big win for the company. As we think about combining that relief with a generally tighter regulatory environment, what CET1 are you looking at? And what level are you looking at in terms of, \"Okay, now I'm at the right level. This is now my target in the new world.\" And now in an environment where balance sheet growth is minimal at best, right, I can now return capital back to shareholders through buybacks. I guess I'm just wondering because there's your printed gap CET1, there's the adjustment that John gave, right? But then you only have to take into account 25% of that 250 by 1 July 2025, if we get to a final date by then. So there's a lot of moving pieces.\nSo as your investors think about all this progress that you've made plus this relief, what is your new target? Is that transitional or fully phased in? And what's the bogey that investors could look forward to that you would hit before returning capital through buybacks?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYes, Erika, I understand the question. And first of all, I just want to highlight we're back to 9.7, which is where we started before the deal. And we're able to build. We went from 9.7 to 8.4 and built 130 basis points in basically less than a year, which I thought was a great effort across the company. In terms of what our new target is, I think our short-term target is to continue to build, as we talked about. Remember, there's two sets of rules that are yet to be finalized and coming down. Number one are the Basel III Endgame finalization of rules, which will, in one way, shape, or form, increase capital levels. And the second is clarity on CCAR. We'll set those targets once we have clarity on those two items.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nJust to follow up here, at least until June 2024 CCAR results, regardless of how quickly you build the capital, either on an adjusted or on a GAAP basis, you're going to continue to be at pause on the buyback until at least then until we see the CCAR and the SCB.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThat's my expectation, Erika. We want clarity on the finalization of the Basel III and then CCAR, importantly. So we'll be continuing to build capital and determine our capital targets and buffers and all that activity once we have more clarity in the finalization of the rules.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. That's very clear. And just one more for John, if I may. In terms of the net interest income trajectory, I think the fourth quarter bottom is good news, especially relative to what we thought two days ago, which would be more RWA mitigation. As we think about the RWA mitigation ahead that's less impactful to EPS, should we think about it similar to what we saw early in the year in terms of securitizations? Are you more actively going to continue to use credit-linked notes, which I assume costs you 12.5% or so of the pool plus SOFR and a spread? And as we think about those dynamics, do you feel like you have to warehouse more liquidity as we anticipate LCR rules for regional banks? Because we're also hearing that there could be pretty significant haircuts on how they're thinking about HTM as HQLA.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. Erika, so maybe I'll start with your last point. On LCR, we will, in addition to what Andy said on the capital side, we're going to have to wait and see what it is on the liquidity side in terms of any potential changes that come out of LCR. We feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve whatever that change is and feel that we'll be able to achieve that, whatever that scenario is. We'll work into it. In terms of you talked about the net interest income, we feel like it's, again, just to kind of reiterate, we are looking for that to bottom at this particular point in time in the fourth quarter. And where it kind of goes from there post will depend in part by interest rates.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Congratulations on the release of commitments.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Erica.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nHi, Andy. Good morning. How are you?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nGood.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nAndy, obviously, US Bancorp has developed a reputation of being a strong underwriter, and we've talked about this in the past with you folks. I was wondering if you could frame out the environment because every bank is talking about credit normalization, as you guys did, because we had such great numbers coming out of the pandemic on credit. If you just exclude for a moment the economy, because obviously, none of us can control that, but I'd really be interested in what you guys are seeing from a competitive standpoint in terms of underwriting. If you could compare it to past cycles. Obviously, we've been around for a few cycles and can compare it. But I'm curious, from your guys' vantage point, is it as risky today as it may have been in 2005, 2006, or 1999, 2000?\nAny color there that you can share with us?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nWell, let me give you the big picture, and I'm going to ask Terry to highlight some specifics. I would say the consumers entering this cycle in very strong shape from a balance standpoint, from the perspective of savings accounts that they have, the spend activity, I think, are all starting to normalize, but normalize to a pre-pandemic, what I would say, normal level. The companies and small businesses are also in very good shape. The one area that we're all very focused on is commercial real estate office, which is one of the areas that we increased our reserve to. As you know, it's at 10% in this quarter. So maybe, Terry, you can go on some specifics.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, US Bancorp\n\nYeah. And what I would add to that, Gerard, is, as you know, when we think about underwriting, we really underwrite through a cycle. We try to take into consideration and stress from an underwriting perspective what could happen in terms of rising interest rates or other economic factors that could come into play. So we haven't adjusted our underwriting standards a lot as we have been thinking about this particular cycle.\nI do think that when you end up looking at the industry, I think there is some tightening that's going on out there. Certainly, from a competitive standpoint, we are seeing that to some extent. But we feel like we're in pretty good shape. If you end up looking at our situation, as Andy said, probably the area that we're monitoring the most is commercial real estate office space specifically.\nWe have a reserve that's about 10% of the overall balance there. We have been increasing that, and we're likely to continue to increase that because that's going to be a pressure point. But we're starting from, if you think about the overall portfolio, we're starting at fairly low points. Our non-accrual loans is only 35 basis points of total loans. Our allowance is strong at 208. Delinquencies are still at relatively low levels, although increasing. Our expectation as we go into 2024 is that that normalization will continue. Delinquencies will continue to kind of move up, and non-performing assets will continue to move up. But I think we're in a really good position in terms of the allowance coverage that we have, and we feel pretty good about that.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good. Good to hear your voice, Terry. Just to follow up on what you were saying, from a competitive standpoint, do you sense the extreme, of course, was 2005, 2006 when all of the crazy lending was being done by some banks, but also the non-banks? When you guys look at the non-bank competitors, are there rogue players out there that are just doing crazy things so that the second derivative impacts the banks? Not because any of the banks, yourself included, made a poor underwriting decision, but it was the competitors that really did something foolish, and now the banks are suffering a bit. Or again, not like 2006. I'm not suggesting we're there, but just from a comparison standpoint.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, US Bancorp\n\nI think both in the bank and in the non-bank space, I think that people are being fairly rational. Part of the issue is that it's maybe more so on the demand side of the equation as much as anything. I think corporate America is being relatively cautious out there. They're still waiting to see where interest rates settle in at. And until they see more certainty with respect to what the interest rate inflationary environment looks like, I think corporate America is being relatively cautious, and therefore, demand is relatively soft. But we're not seeing what I would say crazy things either on the bank or on the non-bank side at this particular point in time. In fact, we're probably seeing, if you end up looking at commercial real estate, probably a pullback across the board.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGreat. And then as my second follow-up question, Andy, it was obviously great news that you guys had yesterday about the release. Is there any read-through? Obviously, you sat down with the regulators to get that release, and they seem to be fairly rational in their decision to make that change. There's been a lot of hope and criticism that the Basel III Endgame proposals are pretty darn strict. Do you think, is there any read-through where we may actually see some rationality with the regulators, and they may kind of pare back some of those requirements, or is that too far of a stretch?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nI think the regulators have asked for feedback. The banks will provide feedback both collectively and individually. I think a lot of the feedback is good feedback because of the consequences to our customers. And I think that's the area of focus that we're going to be very pointed on in terms of our feedback. And we want to make sure that from a banking standpoint, we're able to serve our customers, and the rules that will create some friction around that in certain categories. And that's where we're going to focus. And my anticipation is that the Fed will listen to our perspectives, and that's my hope.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGood. Thank you. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, US Bancorp\n\nI was just going to say, particularly, it can be punitive with respect to low and moderate-income customer base. You see some capital rules related to renewable energy, tax credits that don't make that seem punitive at this particular point in time. So I do think there's a number of different areas where there's opportunity for adjustment.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Vivek.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nMorning. Shifting gears from capital, given that you've made a lot of progress to just your normal business. Payments, you've talked, Andy, about wanting to grow merchant processing, mid to high single digits, really more in the high single digits, and some of the others in the low double digits, like corporate payments. Any thoughts on how you get back up there? Because that hasn't been the case the last couple of quarters. What do you need to do or change, or what would help you get there?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nI'm going to ask John to start, then I'll add in.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. So in terms of merchant processing, we have been making a number of investments over the years and continue to expect that high single digit in terms of the merchant sort of thing. The numbers have been strong this quarter, but there's normalization that has been happening. And so in the quarter to quarter here, the last several quarters, there's been a lot of the nuances coming out of the COVID and all those sorts of things. So if you think about airline tickets, hotels, and corporate T&E, those have been very strong, but they're normalizing. That said, services and retail have been strong. And the retail print that we saw yesterday was very constructive. So we feel like there's good underpinnings there in addition to the investments that we make to continue to believe and give us confidence in our projections there.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nI think two of those most important investments, Vivek, are our tech-led initiative, which is about 1/3 of our revenue base right now is tech-led from a perspective of new activity. Secondly is that what we've talked a lot about, which is this business payments ecosystem, which continues to be a top priority for the company because I think it's a huge opportunity for our business banking customer base as well as our commercial customer base. Then you add in what we're getting from Union Bank. I think that's why we're confident in that higher single-digit increase.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then another fee business that you mentioned, you're expanding capital markets since you're not doing your investor days anymore. Any color on what you're doing there to expand that? You've always had the loan syndications and debt capital markets. What else are you doing to step that up in terms of the level of revenues from that?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nSure. This is John. So this is another area where we have continued to make investments in back-end systems, the front line, acquiring talent, and all these sorts of things. And it's been a great story for us, and we continue to invest in this going forward. And along with high-grade and underwriting, there's high yield as well as what other areas that have been very strong is in the derivative market, providing interest rate hedging products for our clients, especially in this time where interest rates are moving around quite a bit. That's a service that has been highly needed. Foreign exchange has been a growing component here as well. And particularly now with Union Bank, we have more of a West Coast customer base and more of a foreign exchange need.\nIn addition to some of the businesses that we work with in the corporate trust side, as you know, we have businesses in Europe as well. So there's always some form of foreign exchange, and so we've seen a lot of growth there. In addition to that, we've been gaining market share in the investment-grade business, and high yield over the coming days. I think we've had an investment grade in the top 10 now in terms of market share. So that has been a business that has continued to advance slow and steady, and it's been a good item for us, business for us.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nBefore we take our next question, I'd like to remind everybody it is 1:00. To ask a question. Next, we'll go to Matt O-Connor with Deutsche Bank.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nMorning, Matt.\n\nMatt O-Connor\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nMorning. I was wondering, slide 7 that shows some of the revenue opportunities. I was wondering if you could size that? Sorry, related to the UB deal. The revenue synergy is related to the UB deal that you outlined in slide 7. Is there any way to frame how big that might be or what time frame?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nIt is a high priority for each of our businesses. Probably the greatest priority is that first one you highlight, which is our credit card opportunity. The payments business is a strength of US Bank. Our card offering is terrific, and we've already had a penetration increase from where we started, and that continues to be a focus. And then you think about that with the business clients as well. I think it is a material impact, but we're still working through exactly the sizing and timing, and we'll continue to update on that. But it is a priority and a focus area for each of our businesses.\n\nMatt O-Connor\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Deutsche Bank",
    "content2": "Okay. And then separately, a little bit of a technical question. I forget some of my CFA materials. But when we look at the securities book of a duration of less than three and a half years, but you're only burning down 25% through 2025, remind me how that math works, and does the burndown kind of step up as we think about 2026? Right? Because the duration is pretty short, and the burndown is not all that much in the first couple of years.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nYeah. The function of the curve really changed as we saw the curve flatten out quite a bit this quarter. What I'd say on that is we have a number of securities that obviously are fixed rate that have longer durations to them or longer average lives. And then we have a number of with the security portion where we have swaps, that has very, very low duration. It's three months or so because of how it swapped to the floating rate index. So in addition to that, as we've added on some of the security book, we have about $8 billion or so of when we did some of the auto repack transactions in the fourth quarter of last year as well as the second quarter of this year. That is very short as well in addition to some of the floating rate securities within that book.\nSo it's kind of more of a barbell approach, which gives you the duration of it, which just gives us a value change for a move in interest rates. But in terms of the burndown, that will depend part about how the shape and the type of securities that are within the book.\n\nMatt O-Connor\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Obviously, less relevant now given the Fed's decision, but still something we're all tracking. So thank you.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nEVP and CFO, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we can go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. So just one more follow-up on the category two news. I just want to make sure we're super clear. So does 700 billion stop being a bind forever? Obviously, you don't have to cross on the prior potential time frame. But to the prior question, just wondering, you said you don't have an asset cap. So does that mean that category two is now a non-thing for US Bank going forward in any time period? Or when you cross naturally, do you still get on the natural clock of having to comply? Just wondering how that fits in with the news you got yesterday.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nSo we're bound, Ken, by the current rule set, which is after four quarters of an average of $700 billion. Then you would go to Category II. Or the new Basel III rule set, which is yet to be finalized, as you said. But the current rule set is what we're bound on. So 700 still is important, but what we're saying is, given where we think asset growth will be, given our continued optimization in certain categories, given our focus on high-return businesses, we do not see that as a hurdle to growth.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Thank you, Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, US Bancorp\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nWith no further questions, I'll hand the call back over to George Andersen.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, US Bancorp\n\nThanks, Brad. Thank you, everyone, for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, and John Stern, Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Finance. During initial prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, our press release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. The Q2 was highlighted by our successful conversion of Union Bank and a meaningful increase in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to 9.1%, 60 basis points higher than the Q1, driven by earnings accretion and balance sheet optimization actions. Earnings per share totaled $0.84 in the Q2, including $0.28 per share of notable items. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share was $1.12. Slide four provides reported and adjusted income statement results and other key metrics. Our Q2 results were supported by new customer account growth and deepening of relationships across our business lines, as well as continued disciplined expense management. Net interest income was lower compared with the Q1, primarily due to pressures on deposit pricing.\nHowever, momentum in fee income businesses continues strong. One of the strengths of our business model is our diverse and stable funding that includes a mix of both consumer and operational wholesale deposits. This quarter, while our average deposit balances decreased by 2.6% linked quarter, period-end deposits were higher by 3.2%, or approximately $522 billion, largely reflective of seasonal operational deposit flows in areas such as our corporate banking, and trust businesses. Credit quality metrics remain strong versus pre-pandemic levels, but are normalizing as expected. This quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet by increasing the loan loss reserve, reflective of our prudent approach to credit risk management. Slide five provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was about 1.07%, and our return on tangible common equity was 22.3%. Slide six provides a summary of our recently completed conversion of Union Bank.\nFollowing our main systems conversion on Memorial Day weekend, all credit card trust and investment accounts were transitioned to our platform in June. Early indications are encouraging, and I'm even more confident today of the strategic and financial merits of this deal. We continue to expect meaningful revenue opportunities, and our cost synergy targets remain intact. One highlight is the Union Bank customers are adopting our digital capabilities more quickly than expected. As of 30 June, just one month following conversion, we have had over a half a million enrollments in our digital product offerings, and this number continues to grow. Our teams are working diligently to leverage the value of overlaying all of our products and services to Union Bank customers as we continue to provide, and we will continue to provide updates on our progress.\nI'll now turn the call over to Terry, who provided more detail on the quarter.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. Turning to slide seven, our balanced mix of consumer, corporate, and commercial deposits continues to be a key source of strength for the bank. As Andy highlighted, while average total deposits declined 2.6%, or $13.1 billion, on a linked quarter basis, we ended the period with $522 billion of deposits, representing a 3.2% increase in ending balances on linked quarter. This quarter, our end-of-period percent of noninterest-bearing deposits declined to approximately 20% from 25% in the Q1 due to both industry dynamics and a change we made to Union Bank retail accounts at conversion. Specifically, about half of the decline was related to an increase in deposit volumes and mix shift, while the other half was primarily driven by a customer-friendly product conversion decision by us.\nTo create a more positive customer experience, we upgraded Union Bank customers to our interest-bearing Bank Smartly checking product, which offers a better checking solution as well as other benefits. This change will provide customer retention benefits without a material impact on our net interest margin. Given current interest rate volatility and the significant competition for deposits across the industry, we now expect our cumulative deposit beta to be in the mid-40% range by the end of this rate cycle, slightly higher than our previous expectation, but consistent with the deposit pricing dynamics in the industry. On slide eight, average total loans this quarter were $389 billion, which was flat on a linked quarter basis and up 19.9% year-over-year.\nCommercial real estate loans represent approximately 14% of our total average loan portfolio, with commercial real estate office exposure representing only 2% of total loans and 1% of total commitments. Our office exposure is well balanced among suburban, specialty, and central business districts and had a weighted average loan to value ratio of approximately 55% at initial underwriting. Given current macro factors as well as other portfolio considerations, we increased the reserve ratio for commercial real estate office loans to 8.5%. Turning to slide nine, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84 for the quarter, or $1.12 per share after adjusting for notable items in the amount of $575 million, or $0.28 per diluted common share.\nNotable items this quarter included $310 million of merger and integration-related charges associated with the acquisition of Union Bank, as well as $265 million related to balance sheet optimization and capital management actions, largely driven by a provision charge of $243 million related to the securitization of approximately $4.4 billion of indirect auto loans, as well as an additional $4.2 billion sale of Union Bank mortgage loans. These moves enable us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimized returns. Slide 10 provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter. Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represented a 4.7% decrease on a linked-quarter basis and a 28.4% increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates in the acquisition of Union Bank.\nOur net interest margin declined from 3.10% in the Q1 to 2.90% in the Q2, which is somewhat lower than expected. The link quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of maintaining higher cash levels given the debt ceiling concerns and deposit pricing pressures partially offset by higher rates on earning assets. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income increased 8.7%, or $219 million on a link quarter basis, driven by higher payment services revenue, trust investment management fees, and commercial product revenues. Within payment services, revenue increased $112 million on a link quarter basis, reflecting credit card revenue growth of $62 million, or 17.2%, driven by higher margins and sales volume, and an increase in merchant processing revenue of $49 million, or 12.7%, driven by pricing.\nAlso noteworthy were increases in trust and investment management fees of $31 million, or 5.3%, driven by core business growth, and commercial product revenue of $24 million, or 7.2%, driven by strong debt capital markets activity in the quarter. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income for the company increased $178 million, or 7.0%, largely driven by higher core fee income. Turning to slide 13, reported non-interest expense for the company totaled $4.6 billion in the Q2, which included $310 million of merger and integration-related charges. Non-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $52 million, or 1.2%, on a link quarter basis. Slide 14 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong from a historical perspective but are normalizing as expected. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.29% at 30 June, compared to 0.30% at 31 March and 0.23% a year ago.\nOur Q2 net charge-off ratio of 0.35%, as adjusted, increased five basis points from a Q1 level of 0.30%, as adjusted, and was higher when compared to the Q2 2022 level of 0.20%. Our allowance for credit losses as of 30 June 2023 totaled $7.7 billion, or 2.03% of period end loans. Turning to slide 15, we accelerated our capital actions and ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.1%. The 60 basis points link quarter increase in the CET1 ratio reflected 20 basis points of earnings accretion, net of distributions, and an additional 40 basis points attributable to risk-weighted asset and other balance sheet optimization initiatives with low to neutral earnings impact.\nDuring the quarter, we received the results of the Federal Reserve's 2023 stress test, and we expect to be subject to the minimum stress capital buffer requirement of 2.5%, which is unchanged from last year, despite this year's more stressful economic scenario and an additional $1.4 billion of merger-related charges with limited recognition of cost synergies related to Union Bank. I will provide Q3 and updated full year 2023 forward-looking guidance on slide 16. Starting with Q3 2023 guidance, we expect net interest income of between $4.2 and 4.4 billion in the Q3. Total revenue, as adjusted, is estimated to be in the range of $6.9 to 7.1 billion, including approximately $75 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, inclusive of approximately $120 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to the Union Bank acquisition.\nOur income tax rate, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately 23% to 24% on a taxable equivalent basis. We expect merger and integration charges of between $150 to 200 million in Q3. I will now provide updated guidance for the full year. For 2023, net interest income is expected to be in the range of $17.5 to 18.0 billion. Total revenue, as adjusted, is now expected to be in the range of $28.0 to 29.0 billion, inclusive of approximately $330 million of full year purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense, as adjusted for the year, is expected to be approximately $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%.\nWe continue to expect to have $900 million to 1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023, a total merger and integration cost of approximately $1.4 billion, consistent with earlier guidance. I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Terry. I'll finish up on slide 17. The strength and stability of our balance sheet remains a differentiator for our company, and these metrics indicate, as these metrics indicate, we are well capitalized and prepared for a potentially more challenging economic environment given our strong liquidity, diversified business mix, and consistent and disciplined approach to credit risk management. Building capital remains a top priority as we prepare for Category II designation, and we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic growth opportunities and key initiatives.\nFollowing the successful conversion of Union Bank this quarter, we enter the second half of the year well positioned as a national banking franchise with increased scale, broader reach, and meaningful revenue growth opportunities provided by the addition of 1.2 million new consumer and small business customers. Across the business, from consumer to wealth management and commercial to business banking, we see significant opportunities to provide legacy Union Bank customers with a broad set of our products and services and industry-leading digital capabilities. Additionally, the $900 million of identified cost synergies are still expected to be fully reflected in run rate savings as we head into 2024. Let me close by thanking our employees for all that they do to help provide exceptional service that makes us a destination of choice for our clients and a valued partner to all our stakeholders. We'll now open up the call to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have a question, please press one, then zero on your phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press one, then zero again. Once again, if you have a question, please press one, then zero on your phone. We'll first go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nHey. I was hoping maybe we could start out with a couple of thoughts or expand the thoughts on capital, maybe just sort of a refresher on anticipated capital build from here, especially in light of just how quickly you just how quick the pace was in the Q2. And then ideally, sort of what you're targeting, presumably under Category II rules, and when you might get there in your view.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think that we ended up at 9.1% CET1 at the end of Q2. Our expectation now through the rest of this year is that we'll be at least at 9.5% by the end of the year. That's going to be a function of earnings accretion, net of distributions, as well as some continued actions from a risk-weighted asset perspective. We had originally articulated about 50 basis points of risk-weighted asset optimization over kind of the two-year time horizon. We felt like we could accelerate that a lot because the vast majority of them were what I would call low to neutral impact on earnings accretion. We still have a number of different levers that we can pull, some of which we'll be able to execute on this year, some of which is in preparation for 2024.\nBut we feel very confident that we have a game plan in order to be able to get to at least 9.5 by the end of this year and to be in a position to be able to fully adopt Category II by the end of 2024, if necessary.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe a question on the deposits. Appreciate all the commentary on the non-interest-bearing runoff being, I guess, about half driven by the product change as you integrated Union Bank customers. But just given sort of the optics of it, just curious about any thoughts. Is that pretty much done, or would you expect for the broader or entirety of the firm, could NIB balances still continue to flow out just in light of where interest rates are? And where would you see those flushing out, maybe as a percent of total deposits?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, Scott. This is John. So in terms of the DDA mix, you illustrated that correctly. We moved about $15 billion of deposits over into the Bank Smartly interest-checking product. And so that gets us to about a 20% ratio. We think that that's about where we land here. It'll be ±, of course, as we kind of go through the quarters. But we think that we're at a low point here.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Okay. Good. Thank you very much.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, John.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGood morning. Regarding your net interest income guidance of the 17th half 18 beyond the non-interest-bearing mix commentary that you just provided, can you also help unpack that guidance in terms of overall deposit growth expectations, as well as maybe the margin assumption behind that, and loan growth as well, if possible? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSure. This is John again. So a couple of things I would say, maybe just to provide additional context. As you saw in our results, we saw a big increase in our deposits, up 3% on a period-ending basis to $522 billion. And then we had, as Terry mentioned about our capital actions, we had loans drop a start point of about 2%, given the auto and the mortgage sale that we talked about within our comments. And so as I think about those things, we will have the ability to be a little bit more disciplined and moderate in our deposit pricing as we go forward, given that line of thinking. And in addition, I think that as we bring on new loans, those loans are coming in at wider spreads.\nAlthough loan growth is a little bit stalled, there's a little bit less demand for that in the near term here. The mix here of loans should be more favorable as we're bringing on cards and less in mortgage and auto. Those are kind of the puts and takes to how we came up with the net interest income guidance. Then I think you made a comment about deposits there as well, and I can just touch on that.\nI think on the deposit side, we would, even though we had a large seasonal uplift, as typical in Q2 from our corporate trust and commercial businesses that bring in deposit balances, as that begins to normalize, we think we're probably in line with the industry, which we anticipate being more of a decline, given the quantitative tightening and all the other sorts of things that are headwinds for deposits in the industry.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. And the other thing I would just mention, John, you asked a question regarding NIM. Our expectation now, just kind of looking at the market-implied rate environment, is that NIM is probably down a few basis points in Q3 and then relatively stable through the rest of the year.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGot it. No, thank you. That's very helpful. And just lastly, the confidence in your through-cycle deposit beta of about 40% looks like we have a number of banks that are turning to the high 40s and into the 50s. Just what gives you the confidence in that through-cycle beta expectation of around 40?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So we're looking at our calculations show us at about 39% in the current beta, and we're indicating mid-40s is where we'll land. And I think it just goes back to some of the things that we talked about earlier, where we did have a big flight in of deposits. We think, well, we have loans that have come down given the capital actions, and so that gives us a little bit more flexibility with pricing. But of course, there'll be pressure as it relates to deposit betas just as we go through it. But all that is kind of baked into our mid-40s guide.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Ebrahim. How are you?\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood. How are you? Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on this capital build. It's obviously a big topic. As we think about future RWA optimization, I think you mentioned some of the low-hanging fruit, I guess, things that were EPS neutral. It seems like you executed on those this quarter. As we look forward to, I think you mentioned some action in the back half, some into 2024. How punitive are those going to be from an EPS standpoint that we should think about? I'm assuming that's in your guidance for 2023. But give us a sense of just the EPS hit from these actions and how much more of RWA optimization should we think about between now and, let's say, year end 2024?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Great question, Ebrahim. And so let me maybe unpack it a little bit in terms of the different types of actions that we are likely to take. One, as an example, is we're going to be kind of winding down a cash provisioning of business. So that'll have very minimal impact from an earnings perspective because it's not that big of a business, but it is a pretty significant user of capital in terms of risk-weighted assets. So that's one area and one example of how we still think that there is low to neutral sort of opportunity in terms of enhancing or improving the risk-weighted asset position. We'll continue to be focused on reducing our MSR, our mortgage servicing rights portfolio, over the course of the next several quarters. That's an area that, again, it has some impact, but it's not significant.\nAnd probably more importantly, it allows us to rebalance the size of the mortgage exposure, mortgage portfolio relative to the overall size of the business. We'll continue to look at kind of similarly mortgage loan sales out of the Union Bank portfolio. Again, that reduces our concentration in California and should have minimal sort of impact kind of on a go-forward basis. And then there's just a number of other things, similar sort of structures that we've done. But the other thing that we're working on between now and the end of the year, which will kind of position us well to be able to continue to improve on a risk-weighted asset basis, is setting up some securitization programs related to some of our other balance sheet asset positions.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. Just one follow-up. Strategically, I think the one question is, this environment should be ideal for USB to take market share. Competitors are under pressure. Clearly, your balance sheet holding up quite well. Give us a sense of just how much of a constrained capital levels are today as you think about getting new customer growth, picking up market share, adding sort of maximizing the Union franchise. Just how much of a restrictive factor capital is to accomplish all of those?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Go ahead, Andy. Go ahead.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo Ebrahim, I wouldn't say it's a constraint. We're focused on profitable growth. We have a diverse set of business products and services that allow us to grow in a capital-efficient way. I mean, I'll give you a couple of examples. The Union Bank customer base, about 80% of the consumer small businesses are single-service customers. Their penetration on credit cards is about half what ours is across the legacy US banks. So we have a lot of opportunities to deepen relationships in a very capital-efficient way, given the broad product set that we have. So that is an opportunity that we're very much focused on, looking forward to, and not feeling constrained.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Many of those single-service or balance sheet today, deepening the relationship will be as much focused on fee-based sort of businesses, which are capital-efficient, as Andy said.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, Ken.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, a really good fee result this quarter. I just wanted to ask you, as I'm looking at the payments slide on page 19, it does look like the year-over-year growth rates did all slow versus the Q1. Can you just talk about what's going on across the payments with regards to just where the consumer is and how you expect corporate spending to trend as you look ahead, given the potential for a slowing economy?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. And of course, that's the $100,000 question, is whether or not we actually move into a recession or not. But I think broadly, from a macro perspective, some of the things that we're seeing is that some of the excess savings that consumers have held in the past have come down to really pre-pandemic levels at this particular point in time. So I think that manifests itself in kind of a normalization of consumer spend. So we are seeing what was very strong consumer spend starting to normalize and soften, if you will. I mean, yesterday was retail sales information that came out a little bit softer than maybe expected. We're seeing some of those same dynamics in the payments business, where sales, for example, in the merchant side of the equation, slower, softer sort of retail sales.\nBut there's still a fair amount of travel expenditure that's taking place. So customers are certainly choosing, and maybe being a little more choosy as to where they're spending their dollars. Some of the dynamics that we're seeing is while sales have softened maybe a bit, the margins in some of the businesses have actually improved. So on the credit card side of the equation, where sales have come down a little bit, the margins are actually a little stronger. On the corporate payment side of the equation, margins continue to get stronger because T&E spend at the commercial corporate sectors is continuing to be reasonably strong. So we continue to kind of look out the rest of the year on the merchant acquiring side of the equation of revenue kind of in that high single digits sort of range.\nOn the credit card fee revenue, still in that mid-single digits. On the corporate payment side of the equation, it'll normalize, but it'll kind of normalize in that high single digits range. That's kind of what we're seeing, what we're kind of forecasting at this particular point in time based upon consumer behavior.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGot it. And one follow-up on capital. Can you just give us, just so we all have the right number from your perspective, where CET1 was this quarter inclusive of AFS unrealized losses? And also just your view of, if rates stay the same here, what that pull-to-par looks like as you look forward to that year-end 2024 point. Thanks.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So if you were to embed the AOCI into the CET1 calculation under Category II, it would have been at 6.9%. And we expect that, based upon all of our capital actions, to get to kind of our target levels by the end of 2024. We have the game plan in order to be able to get there. We feel confident about that.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Can you just have the AFS piece of what does pull-to-par by the end of the year? Because it's hard for us to understand how much the risk-weighted asset part might be, but at least we can kind of track to your view of the portfolio maturity.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Do you have that, John?\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So in terms of the burndown between here and the end of 2024, it's about 25% or so.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we can go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. I need to ask a capital question again just because it's been such a big deal for your stock. And I'm wondering if you could indulge me in some sort of cavewoman math here. So 6.9% CET1, you have six quarters to generate capital. Based on what you're earning today, you could add another 120 basis points, right, for six quarters times 20, and that'll get you to 8%. So given that you've mentioned, both Terry and John, throughout the call, some additional RWA actions, how much can RWA actions enhance that potential for 8% fully loaded CET1 by Q4 2024 just on earnings? How much can you add from RWA mitigation?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So maybe just kind of unpacking it a little bit. We still expect, Erika, that the benefit from capital accretion or earnings accretion is going to be somewhere in that 20 to 25 basis points on average. A couple of different things to kind of keep in mind. While there's a little more pressure on the revenue side of the equation, the things that will start to come into the equation is a lot lower merger and integration charges next year. We'll be substantially done with that, as well as the fact that by the end of the year, we will really be at kind of full run rate from a cost synergy standpoint. So I think that there's a number of things just in terms of why we feel confident that that accretion level starts to accelerate or creep up from where we're at today.\nAnd then, I think when you end up going through, John talked a little bit about the burndown being at about 25% between now and the end of the year. And that's based upon market implied. But also keep in mind, as we have said, is we have put into place some hedging strategies to protect us from the upside risk that might exist if rates were to move up. So we feel pretty good about where that is going to come in. And then the rest of it is really tied to risk-weighted asset actions, many of which I ended up talking about. And again, we have a pretty confident game plan with respect to our ability to reduce risk-weighted assets in order to be able to achieve the targets that we need to hit.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nLet me just ask it another way, again, just because it feels like some of the good stuff that's going on in the company is being ignored because of this capital question regarding Category II. Based on your outlook and under a reasonable range of scenarios for the economy, do you think you could get to 8.5% to 9% fully loaded CET1 by Q4 2024?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we can go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHi, John.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, Terry. Yeah. Just one last follow-up on that walk, starting from the 6.9, getting to 8.5 to 9. So is that the idea that the AOCI is kind of like a 210 basis point drag today, and that'll shrink to, in your numbers, something like 150 or that kind of drag by the end of next year?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYes.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And does your walk include FDIC assessment and CECL provision, things like that?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYes.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. The next question was just on credit. How do you see a charge-off trajectory from here? I know you've said normalize 50. You won't get there for a while. But the jumping-off point is 35 basis points, I guess, this quarter. How do you see it kind of playing out from here?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. It's going to continue to normalize for all the different things we have been talking about, and I think the industry has been talking about. Our expectation is that that 35 creeps up into the kind of mid-40s by maybe the end of the year, early next year, and then it kind of normalizes around 50 basis points once we get into 2024.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Got it. And does the full-year guidance on expenses for this year incorporate some achievement of merger saves in the Q4 of this year?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nIn terms of cost synergies or?\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYeah. Yes. Yes.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.\nIt gets us to the run rate, John, of the full 900 by the end of the quarter.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYep.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nSo when we get into 2024, we will have achieved a full run rate of $900 million of cost synergies.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYou will have achieved most of those by Q4 of this year?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nBy the end of Q4. Yep.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And that's built into the guidance for the full year this year?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYep. Yep. Yes.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nWe can go to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nManaging Director, Openheimer & Co, Inc.\n\nYeah. I think last quarter, you shared that the average duration of your securities portfolio went down from like 4.3 to 3.8 years or something like that. I wonder if you could give us the similar trend in the Q2, the outlook for the balance of the year, and just your philosophy in general about reinvesting maturities. Is that kind of going into cash, or are you kind of maintaining the duration that you have?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Yeah. The duration that we had talked about with respect to the AFS portfolio was 3.8 years, and that has continued to come down a little bit, not measurably, but down a little bit from there. Our game plan, I guess, is that we're going to continue to work on shortening the duration of the AFS portfolio. It kind of helps us de-risk that. We will keep more in short-term sort of securities, whether it's that or cash. It'll be kind of a combination.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nManaging Director, Openheimer & Co, Inc.\n\nOn the HTM portfolio, is there a similar kind of move to shorten duration, or are you comfortable where it is?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Well, with respect to the HTM portfolio, that's just kind of going to run down over time or burn down over time. We're not adding to the HTM portfolio at this particular point.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nManaging Director, Openheimer & Co, Inc.\n\nOkay. All righty. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHey, Vivek.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nStock Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSorry for the repetition given the multiple calls. So I guess a couple of things. On merchant processing, any color on why it's up only 2% year-on-year in terms of fees? I hear you on the travel slowing, but there's also a lower fee. What's caused such a sharp slowdown, and what turns that around to the mid-single digits, Terry?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Some of it's year-over-year comp and how it'll kind of play out. But the biggest driver, Vivek, in the merchant processing at this particular point is the fact that the travel airlines specifically is continuing to become a higher portion of the overall mix. That we think is starting to stabilize. In other words, much of that growth has been in the airline space, but we think that that kind of stabilizes. Airline happens to have a lower margin. And so that's the dynamic that you're seeing.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nStock Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGot it. Okay. And OCI, your loss seems to have gone up. Did you not get any benefit from the hedges you put on, or is there something else going on underneath?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah.\n\nJohn Stern\n\nSEVP and Head of Finance, U.S. Bancorp\n\nI think the investment portfolio AOCI declined or the mark declined by about $250 million linked quarter. But rates went up 50 to 60 basis points across the points of the curve that matter to the portfolio. So it's not totally flat. As we talked about, there's a duration to that book, and so you would expect a wider mark given the higher level of rates. So I think with the hedges that we have put in place that helped mute that, it could have been higher. And we continue to add hedges across that portfolio and pick our spots when we see rates fall. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nHi, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, gentlemen. Terry, you've talked a bit about a normalization in net charge-offs moving into 2024. Can you share with us what kind of assumptions you're using to get to that normalization rate in charge-offs, both economic and just the way the customer base may behave?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYou want to talk about that?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, Gerard, I'll start. This is Andy. We think there's probably a fairly equal weight probability that we'll either see a soft landing or a mild recession. And if we do get a recession, our models would indicate it would be short and shallow, either late this year or early in 2024. And you know there's still pricing pressure, and the inflation's not solved. So we have one more rate hike by the end of the year modeled in. But on the other hand, as Terry mentioned, excess savings has come down significantly, and consumer spending is slowing. So the Fed is getting its desired outcome. So big picture, we think the Fed's close to being done.\nAs I said, sort of this probability of either shallow and soft, or mild recession and/or a soft landing is what we've modeled in to get to those assumptions Terry's articulated.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nA couple of things I would just add, maybe from a portfolio dynamic perspective. We're seeing nice growth in terms of credit card balances. And as credit card balances both increase and it normalizes, you'll start to see that ratio going up because that's a little higher mix for us. And then I think it may be somewhat lumpy, but it's kind of incorporated into it as just continuing to work through commercial real estate office space over the course of the next few years.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. And then, I apologize if you addressed this question, but with the expectation of the Basel III end-game capital requirements coming shortly, and this week the disclosures that it seems like residential mortgages may be exposed to higher risk-weighted assets, how are you guys thinking about that in terms of RWA strategies if mortgages do get a bigger weight in other areas or greater than expected?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Well, certainly, a lot of our actions, for example, with respect to mortgages and that particular business, is just continuing to de-risk, so to speak. So we're kind of trying to take that into consideration. Our expectation right now, Gerard, is that it's probably going to be fairly neutral to maybe just a little bit of a benefit based upon everything that we're seeing in terms of the end game. But we really have to wait and see what the final rules say and then apply it to our specific portfolio.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Terry. Thank you, Andy.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, the asset sales that you did this quarter, was that at the beginning of the quarter or the end? I'm just trying to understand how much revenue from that portfolio you have in Q2.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Most of them were completed closer to the end of the Q2, so in the June timeframe.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And then the revenue outlook for the full year, is that based on June 30 balance sheet, or is that also including the RWA actions you're planning on taking between now and year-end?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nBoth. It incorporates our capital actions in terms of what we expect to execute on between now and the end of the year.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Got it. All right. Okay. Thank you. That's it.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we can move to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nMorning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. Well, on the capital issue, I asked last quarter, do you think there's any chance that you need to raise capital or cut the dividend? I'll just ask that again. I mean, people were doing these mechanistic analyses where they would take the underlying securities losses, reduce that from tangible equity, give you no credit, and then say you would need to raise capital. So now that you've met your year-end capital target, I guess, would you reiterate or to what degree would you reiterate no capital increase, no dividend cut? And in addition, if you could put it in a broader context, the Vice Chair of the Fed, Barr, last week said that actually the economic value of equity at banks goes up because of higher value of deposits. So it seems like he signs on to a lot of the analysis that we analysts do.\nJust if you could comment on the bigger picture about your capital and the flexibility there.\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Mike, this is Andy. And as Terry mentioned, so we accelerated our RWA actions, got to 9.1 at the end of the Q2, well ahead of our 9.0 by the end of the year. We expect to be at least 9.5 by the end of the year, if not better. And we have a game plan we're comfortable with and confident enough to get to 9 under the Category II definition by the end of 2024. So all those things make us confident in the capital walk that we talked about and the actions we're taking.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAnd then on the negative side, you and a lot of regional banks have continued to lower guidance on NII. And here we go again with that. And look, I mean, rates went up faster than you or anyone had expected. The yield curve is a lot more inverted. I guess competition has picked up more than expected. What, Andy, do you think you're in in terms of this downward revision for NII? Do you think you're kind of there now? You said Q3 could be down a little bit. And as you exit the year, do you think you maintained that Q3 level? Or I think you said NIM would be flat after that, but I'm not sure if you mentioned NII. So is the downward revision for NII done or eighth inning, seventh inning?\nWhat does that mean for kind of run rate going to next year?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. So again, obviously, you heard the guidance with respect to NII and NIM. We expect it to be a few basis points down in Q3 and then relatively stable from there. Obviously, this is rate—excuse me—it's Fed policy kind of dependent. So we're trying to look at what the current environment looks like. But we feel like if I had to kind of put what inning are we in, we're—I think we're in the late innings simply because of where the Fed is from a monetary policy standpoint. So while there may continue to be a little bit of downward pressure, we don't see it as being significant from here. Andy, what would you add?\n\nAndy Cecere\n\nChairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Mike, the other thing I'd add is I think one of the benefits of our business model is the diversity of revenue. So even in a stressed environment on deposits, which you're absolutely right about, we have the payments revenue, the trust revenue, the commercial products revenue, and on top of all that, $900 million of cost synergies that we're going to act on. So we're pulling lots of levers, not just on margin. Okay. Thank you.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYou bet.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nNext, we have a follow-up from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nHi, Terry. Thanks. One more on the mitigation and optimization opportunity. Originally, you had talked about 50 basis points of opportunity to harness this year. Obviously, you got 40 this quarter. And now it sounds like the total is more. I'm just trying to, is there a way to size how much more you might see out there between the remainder of this year and next year relative to the original 50 you were targeting?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Again, the 50 that we were targeting, we knew we had a high level of confidence in terms of being able to achieve it because they were low to kind of neutral impact. And they were things that we could kind of execute on. We definitely believe that as we get into 2024, the standing up, which obviously takes a little longer, standing up of securitization programs and many of the actions that I talked about earlier, gets us to where we need to be from a capital perspective. We need to take into consideration the burn down, etc. So that opportunity, I think, is certainly probably in line with another 50 basis points. Would be my guess.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And when you say no impact or low impact, we did see some this quarter in terms of the charge-offs and taxes. I guess they're not run rate. Is that what you mean? But you could have episodic one quarter type impacts?\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Absolutely. We'll continue to see that as we reposition the balance sheet. But again, those impacts are all taken into consideration when we think about the net RWA impacts.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And again, your target that you want to get to for the fully loaded by the end of next year is what? When you say one.\n\nTerry Dolan\n\nVice Chair and CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nYeah. Well, it'll be fully adopted. It'll be roughly 8.5% to 9%.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to George Andersen. Please continue.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nSVP and Director of Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up.",

Thanks.\n\nDot com I would like to remind you that any forward looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty.\n\nActors that could materially change our current forward looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation in our press release, our Form 10-K and its subsequent reports on file with the SEC following their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will take any questions that you have I will now turn the call over to Andy. Thanks, George Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call.\n\nI'll begin on slide three in the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of dollar four which includes 12 per share of charges related to the Union Bank acquisition excluding.\n\nExcluding those notable items earnings per share was $1 16, we achieved record net revenue of $7 $2 billion for the quarter.\n\nFollowing our successful close of Union Bank acquisition in December of 2020 to first quarter results reflected a full year's benefit of the acquired franchise continued growth in earning assets net interest margin expansion and higher non interest income led by stronger commercial product and mortgage banking fee revenues.\n\nSlide four details our reported and adjusted income statement results as well as the end of period and average balances and other performance metrics on the right you'll see the credit quality remains strong, but it's starting to normalize as it affected our charge off ratio of 30 basis points as adjusted is well below pre COVID-19 levels and reflective of our disciplined.\n\nRisk management culture.\n\nThe CET one ratio our binding regulatory constraint was eight 5% at the end of the quarter and is consistent with our target capital ratio.\n\nWe expect to exceed 9.0% later this year as we accrete capital back quickly over the next few quarters and continue to focus on risk weighted asset optimization initiatives.\n\nSlide five provides key performance metrics, excluding notable items our return on average asset was 1.15% and our return on average common equity was 15, 7% a return on tangible common equity was 24, 3% on an adjusted basis.\n\nSlide six provides both a high level timeline and general update on our planned conversion of Union Bank in.\n\nIntegration efforts had been progressing well and we remain on track for a successful main systems conversion over the upcoming Memorial day weekend.\n\nWe anticipate a full transition of all accounts by the second half of the year.\n\nTurning to slide seven the industry disruption early in March has reinforced the importance of maintaining a well diversified.\n\nThis wasn't an appropriate risk profile, we maintain a resilient and diversified deposit base over half of our deposits are insured and 80% of the uninsured deposits are retail or operational in nature or.\n\nOur diversified funding sources ample liquidity levels and strong credit quality supported by disciplined underwriting standards are all hallmarks of our approach to risk management I'll now turn the call over to Terry who can provide more detail on the balance sheet strength and the first quarter earnings results.\n\nSandy.\n\nTurning to slide eight a key strength for the bank as a well diversified deposit base, which remains a stable source of low cost funding.\n\nAs a reminder, following the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank last quarter, our end of period deposits totaled $525 billion, including approximately $80 billion of deposits from Union Bank.\n\nAs we discussed last quarter $9 billion of Union Bank acquired deposits were transitory in nature with 4 billion.\n\nDollars returned to in the fourth quarter and an additional $4.7 billion that moved back to in the first quarter of this year.\n\nIn addition, $1.1 billion of acquired deposits were included in the branch sale order related to pure point, a broker deposit gathering mechanism that we discontinued.\n\nImportantly, prior to the events of March as we saw expected deposit outflow largely consistent with seasonal patterns reflective of our business mix, including our large trust business.\n\nFrom March eight through the end of the quarter deposit balances were relatively stable down only 0.6% is inflows from new customers were slightly offset by the impact of our clients diversify their deposits, you'll see can yield in money market funds consistent with broader industry trends.\n\nDuring this period, we saw an increase in money market funds of approximately $10 billion within our wealth management and investment services businesses.\n\nWe expect the competition for deposits to remain high for the industry in 2023, our cumulative deposit beta through the first quarter was approximately 34% and we expect that to increase to about 40% by the end of this rate cycle generally in line with our previous expectations.\n\nSlide nine provides additional detail on the composition of our highly diversified deposit base as the slide shows our deposit balances are composed of a broad mix of consumer corporate and commercial customers that we support with an expansive Brad our branch distribution network.\n\nAnd mobile capabilities across our national footprint, our deposit base reflects the wide range of customers and industries that are there companies serve.\n\nAt March 31st our percent of insured dip.\n\nDeposits to total deposits was 51% .\n\nApproximately 80% of our uninsured deposits are composed of operational wholesale trust and retail deposits that are stickier, either because they're contractually bound we're tied to Treasury management services and trust activities provided to corporate and institutional clients.\n\nCombined with our consumer base deposits the stability of our funding sources sound.\n\nMoving to slide 10 U S. Banks total available liquidity as of March 31 was $315 billion, representing a 126% of our uninsured deposits as of March as of December 31st our liquidity coverage ratio was 122%.\n\nAs mentioned, our strong debt ratings reflect our diversified business profile, well collateralized credit exposure healthy capital and liquidity profiles and disciplined asset liability management framework.\n\nThese attributes work in concert with our strong balance sheet optimization and management practices to ensure strength and stability of our balance sheet.\n\nSlide 11 provides details on the composition of our investment securities portfolio.\n\nOver the last five quarters and well ahead of the most recent banking disruption we reduced the size of our investment securities portfolio from 30%, 25% of total assets, while increasing cash levels.\n\nPreparation for and as part of the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank, we repositioned our balance sheet by selling fixed rate loans and investment securities paid off borrowings and increased cash balances in response to economic uncertainty industry Diamond dynamics rising interest rates and increased market volatility.\n\nAt March 31, approximately 90% of those securities in our investment portfolio are backed Andrew sponsored by the U S. Federal government with 55% of securities designated as held to maturity and 45% designated as available for sale.\n\nFurther available for sale unrealized losses as a percentage of our investment securities portfolio improved in the first quarter in total ALC I improved by 11% on a linked quarter basis.\n\nYes.\n\nTurning to slide 12, as a reminder, following the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank, Our CET one capital ratio declined from 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2022 to eight 4% as of December 31st which reflected the impact of balance sheet optimization and purchase accounting.\n\nIt means that we will accrete back into capital over the next few years strategically we continue to be encouraged about the financial merits of this deal and the synergistic benefits, we expect to realize as a combined institution.\n\nAs Andy mentioned earlier, our CET one capital ratio at March 31 was eight 5%. The 10 basis point increase from year end reflected 20 basis points of capital accretion offset by the transitional impact of seasonal.\n\nOf 10 basis points as.\n\nAs of March 31st we expect to accrete approximately 20 to 25 basis points of capital per quarter as we complete the Union bank integration and realize cost synergies importantly, this does not include the impacts of planned R. W. A optimization initiatives mentioned earlier.\n\nTurning to slide 13, total end of period loans were $388 billion, which was flat on a linked quarter basis and up 21.6% year over year.\n\nCommercial real estate loans represent approximately 14% of our total loan portfolio with CRE office exposure, representing approximately 2% of total loans and only 1% of total commitments leverage lending balances are not not a significant component of the loan portfolio.\n\nSlide 14 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong, but as expected or started to norm are starting to normalize across the portfolio.\n\nThe ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.3% at March 31, compared with 0.26% at December 31st 0.25% a year ago.\n\nOur first quarter net charge offs of 0.30% as adjusted increased seven basis points versus the fourth quarter level of 0.23% as adjusted it was higher when compared to the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhich was a level of 0.21%.\n\nOur allowance for credit losses as of March 31 totaled $7 $5 billion or $1, 94% of period end loans.\n\nAs the chart on the upper right side of this slide demonstrates our credit performance through the cycle serves as a key differentiator for the bank.\n\nSlide 15 provides a detailed earnings summary for the quarter.\n\nIn the first quarter, we earned.\n\n$1.16 per diluted share excluding 12 cents of notable items related to the acquisition. The recent acquisition of Union Bank Slide.\n\nSlide 16 highlights revenue trends for the quarter net revenue totaled $7 $2 billion in the first quarter, which included a full quarter.\n\nOf revenue contribution from Union bank of $832 million, primarily representing net interest income.\n\nNet interest income grew seven 9% on a linked quarter basis, and 45, 9% year over year, driven by earning asset growth and continued net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates.\n\nNoninterest income as adjusted increased two 7% compared to the fourth quarter driven by higher commercial product revenue mortgage banking revenue and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by losses of $32 million for the security sales.\n\nTurning to slide 17, adjusted noninterest expense for the for the company towards a $4.3 billion in the first quarter, including $546 million from Union Bank.\n\nNoninterest expense as adjusted increased nine 1% on a linked quarter basis, largely driven by the impact of two additional months of Union banks operating expenses core deposit intangible amortization and higher compensation and other noninterest expenses.\n\nI will now provide second quarter and updated full year 2023 forward looking guidance on slide 18.\n\nStarting with the second quarter of 2013 guidance.\n\nWe expect average earning assets of between 600 and $605 billion in the second quarter and a net interest margin of approximately 3%.\n\nTotal revenue as adjusted is estimated to be in the range of seven 1% to $7 $3 billion, including approximately $85 million of purchase accounting accretion.\n\nTotal noninterest expense as adjusted is expected to be in the range of 4.3 to $4 $4 billion inclusive of approximately $120 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union bank.\n\nOur tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on a taxable equivalent basis today.\n\nTo date, we have incurred $573 million and merger and integration costs and anticipated charges of between and anticipate charges of between 250 and $300 million for the second quarter. We continue to estimate total merger and integration costs of approximately $1 $4 billion consistent.\n\nWith earlier guidance.\n\nI will now provide updated guidance for the full year.\n\nFor 2023 average, earning assets are now expected to be in the range of $600 billion to $610 billion.\n\nWe expect the net interest margin to be between a 3.0% to 3.05% for the full year.\n\nTotal revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of $28 $5 billion to $35 billion inclusive of approximately $350 million of full year purchase accounting accretion.\n\nTotal noninterest expense as adjusted for the year.\n\nIt was expected to be in the range of $17.0 billion to $17.5 billion inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union bank.\n\nOur estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is now expected to be approximately 23.0% we continue.\n\nAnd you do expect to have 900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023, I will now hand, it back to Andy for closing remarks. Thanks, Terry events of the past few weeks have certainly raised questions about the overall health of the banking industry and the economic outlook.\n\nIs this a banking involves taking balance risks and these risks must be carefully managed appropriately regulated and prudently mitigated at.\n\nAt U S Bank, we are focused on the strength and stability of our balance sheet, our investment and risk management practices is guided by our core principle that includes always doing the right thing for the many stakeholders communities and constituents we serve a.\n\nA key strength of our institution as our high quality and diversified business mix and deposit base. The combination of a mix of consumer corporate and commercial customers with significant operational deposits broad geographic reach and our full breadth and depth of product and service offerings serves as a key differentiator for the bank.\n\nHi, dad ratings resilient liquidity profile available funding sources and strong earnings capacity enable us to deliver industry, leading regulatory stress test results and contribute to our resiliency during times of uncertainty.\n\nAs we continue to work to ensure a successful conversion of U N Union Bank next month, we are already seeing the benefits of increased scale and market share as we bring our enhanced digital capabilities and broad and diverse product set to the Union bank customer base.\n\nOur reputation as a prudent risk manager has been earned through our performance over many cycles and we have never been more focused on the strength and stability of our balance sheet.\n\nLet me close by thanking our employees for all that they do on a daily basis for our customers communities and shareholders. We have shown incredible strength and stability. During these challenging times and are more confident than ever in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional client service superior product offers superior product offerings in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nWell now open the call for Q&A.\n\nThank you well now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question. Please press. One then zero on your phone if you wish to remove yourself from the queue. Please first one zero again once they are nice to have a question. Please press one then zero on your phone.\n\nOne of them occur.\n\nScott first Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning, everybody.\n\nHey, Scott.\n\nHi lots of noise in the deposit flows in the first quarter I guess I'm moving forward what would your expectations be for total deposit flows are balances and then the mix of noninterest bearing to total as we sort of get through this cycle.\n\nYeah, you know our expectation is that if you end up just looking at the industry, there's going to be pressure on deposits and high competition. You know, we think we will fare.\n\nQuite well with respect to that are you know to the extent that we see changes in deposit so it'll be kind of based upon that competition, so, but I would say relatively stable.\n\nAnd then coming to your second question you know the the mix of N B's as an example in roughly the fourth quarter was about 25%, 26% in that ballpark is 25% and we think it's kind of hitting a that kind of a stable level are you keeping in mind that you know we have a lot of op.\n\ndeposits are tied to our both our corporate and our corporate trust business isn't that kind of helps to sustain it and so it's a combination of things Scott.\n\nOkay perfect. Thank you and then was hoping we could talk for a second about I'm just.\n\nCategorization and when you guys would expect to be a category two bank I think theres a lot of.\n\nGoing round and especially in light of that report for a couple of days ago.\n\nSo maybe it just didn't sort of clear in terms of when would you expect to be a category two bank will that be due to your asset size or okay. Thanks.\n\nAdds flexibility to designate you wanted and then how would would you guys get there by that time.\n\nYeah, you know our our trajectory with respect to category. Two is no earlier than the end of 2024 Ah and until that will be I think that'll be more driven by whether the fed makes that decision or not.\n\nRather than asset size, you know again as we kind of manage the company. You know we're gonna be continued to be very focused on profitable loan growth and things like that.\n\nSo we get there when we get there, but that our you know our expectation right now is no sooner than the end of 2024.\n\nOkay, perfect and you you guys feel like you're prepared to to get there by that time basically.\n\nYeah, it'll be a combination of a couple of things we talked about you know the you just the capital generation from earnings and of course that.\n\nIs helped by the Union Bank transaction and then you know we're very focused on capital management, we have to be yeah I'll just.\n\nBecause of the category two and you know we will be very focused on risk weighted asset optimization and making sure that we're focused on profitable growth.\n\nPerfect. Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nNext we'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nThe question for USB and I don't think your investors that like the I'm, sorry, the cycle credit out performance or even the P. P and our strength. It's well noted that you know the adjustment to your revenue outlook was very minimal relative to peers.\n\nI think the big question that investors have is you know.\n\nStarting from eight 5% for Q1, you know them, you know earnings power and capital organic capital generation of 20 to 25 basis points.\n\nBut as we anticipate cat, two and you're telling us that the fed could decide and not your asset sizes apparel I couldn't decide when that line is what is the what is the new endpoint.\n\nOne in your view.\n\nLet me think about going into that new category I don't think investors think that Eaton has a 90%.\n\nAnd if so how are you thinking about dividend growth this year.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo erika good good question and so I'm just going to go from the beginning I think that would be helpful. So as you know we were well above 9% and came down eight four as a result of the .\n\nBank transaction the Union Bank transaction is a terrific transaction, we're exceeding our revenue expectations, we are coming under on our expense expectations. The accretion is greater than we expected. So the value of the franchises positive for sure.\n\nAs we think about the category two I have three or four factors I think about number one is the earnings accretion that we talked about which is strong and growing and will become even more accretive as we get through the cost takeout component of the Union Bank integration number two is we have a number of initiatives across the board for risk weighted asset optimization those are things like credit.\n\nCredit transfers risk transfers.\n\nA number of things to optimize the balance sheet that I think we ought to be focused on and are very focused on to your question I think with those two things as I mentioned, we expect to exceed 9% by the end of this year that coupled with our ALC burned down and additional accretion as we go into 2024.\n\nMakes me comfortable that we are prepared with whatever event occurs as it relates to category two and the timing as Terry mentioned no later no earlier than the end of 2024.\n\nYeah, a couple of things that I would maybe add them because that's right on coming back to a L. C. I you know that burn will be kind of a function of a lot of different things.\n\nYou know we have been very proactive in terms of repositioning in the F. S portfolio I'm looking at assets as our sales and securitization or asset sales are a security sales et cetera.\n\nAnd I can give you some sense you know the duration of that investment portfolio of the F. S portfolio has gone from a little over 4.5% are in the fourth quarter to about three 8% in at the end of the first quarter. So we're going to continue to shorten the duration on that is going to help us with respect to manage at a L. C.\n\nAnd then in addition to that you know.\n\nWe have been essentially reducing the volatility of a L. C I too up interest rate environments through hedging activities. So it's a it's a combination of a variety of things that we're going to go through.\n\nAnd there's no need to have 10%.\n\n[noise] appropriate new bogey as we think about the shift change for next year.\n\nOn cat too.\n\nSo Erika as you know the.\n\nYeah, the regulators are going through that analysis.\n\nProcess right now too to think about how capital levels ought to be in the industry across the board with a Basel four endgame and whatever changes to categorization that occur. So we are waiting for that.\n\nTo understand what the new environment will look like but the plan that we have in place is assuming what you what Terry just discussed.\n\nAnd just if I could sneak in one last one and you know one of your your peer is closest to you and size that the T. Lac was pretty much done and dusted him. You know I noticed that you mentioned yard you know superior debt ratings several times.\n\nClearly the debt markets are still a little bit dislocated, but how should we think about.\n\nWholesale funding stack from here I noticed on a period end basis short term borrowings went up by 25 billion you know Terry.\n\nTerry as you potentially anticipate yeah.\n\nT lack.\n\nHow should we think about your senior debt issue and plan or.\n\nOr will you sort of hold at that level of borrowings until there is a little bit more lessen dislocation in the senior debt market.\n\nYeah again T. Lack is one of those things that they were gonna learn more as we kind of go over the course of the next 12 months.\n\nThe real question is not whether or not T. Lack will exist because I do believe and we're expecting that it will be something that gets put into place, but how does that get calibrated for you know the regional banks are reflected in the risk profile that we have relative to the subs.\n\nAnd you know there there's a wide range of estimates that are out there are you.\n\nYou know I would we end up looking at that I mean, maybe one a reasonable estimate would be based upon the.\n\nThe foreign bank operators and kind of what levels of T. Lack.\n\nYou know if that is the case for us I think it would be very manageable it would be.\n\nWithin a range that we would be able to manage to and then that just gives us flexibility with respect to how we utilize that within the bank.\n\nThank you.\n\nThanks, Aaron can actually go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning, Mike Hi.\n\nWell your P E b belief and faster close to seven and the market's around 20, so you're.\n\nYour relative P E. One of the lowest in history. So I would posit that the market's concerned about something other than earnings so going back I guess the simple question for you Andy.\n\nWell U S bancorp need to issue capital and how confident are you about that and on the other side.\n\nOur buybacks to casually adoption once you get to 9% CET, one and the reason I bring that up.\n\nIf you've seen the front page articles and papers.\n\nIf you're forced to recognize the unrealized securities losses, you'll have burned out.\n\nAnd then people come up with all sorts of numbers and.\n\nWould you be forced to realize that you heard Pat talk about these issues.\n\nCould you be forced to incorporate that as part of the current stress test.\n\nCould force your hand sooner.\n\nAny color you can get what's your confidence that you might need to issue capital.\n\nOver the next you know year or so.\n\nYeah.\n\nThanks, Mike So as I said I I'm I'm that is not part of our thinking as we sit today I am confident that our earnings accretion our R. W. A optimization, our Aoc burned down we'll all get us to a point that we will be at the appropriate capital levels and I can assure you that it's a high focus area for myself and the entire management team, including Terry So that is.\n\nSomething we're very focused on.\n\nNow as it relates to buybacks I will tell you as we all know Theres a lot of capital changes that are likely to occur from a regulatory standpoint. So we're not going to do anything until we have more clarity around that which we hope to have in the in the second half of the year, but the focus on getting too.\n\nThe appropriate capital levels as quickly as possible are creating capital in building our capital base is priority one.\n\nYeah, Mike was the thing that I would add to that you know we're going to learn with respect to exactly how moving to a category two and you know the inclusion in unrealized losses gets incorporated into the CCAR process.\n\nYou know just as a reminder, we have a pretty significant amount of buffer that already exists just based upon our credit performance in our P. P and our performance because of the earnings capacity.\n\nWe continue to to reduce the volatility of LCI to rising interest rates and we're doing that through you know pay fixed our hedges and you know, they're just shortening the duration and things that I talked about earlier.\n\nEarlier, I think there's very likely that they will incorporate a you know a higher rate environment into the CCAR process.\n\nI will tell you that we've done lots of scenarios that look at a stagflation sort of environment and.\n\nYou know, we actually perform better in that environment, because the revenue streams tend to hold up.\n\nGiven our mix of business et cetera. So you know, we're taking a lot of that into consideration and like Andy said, we feel pretty confident that we don't have to go through a capital raise.\n\nAnd the.\n\nAs part of this year stress test what they are.\n\nInclude the unrealized securities losses.\n\nSince that would incorporate the nine quarter time horizon or now.\n\nNo that is not required in the CCAR analysis.\n\nAs a condition of the the way the deal was structured.\n\nAnd then last short one here your noninterest bearing deposits I know you brought that up before it certainly went down more than average this quarter, but you're not guiding your margin down too much you said three to three 5% versus three one this quarter why wouldn't you be gotten that down even further.\n\nGiven the decline in noninterest bearing deposits quarter over quarter yeah.\n\nYeah. It's a couple of different things one is again, if you end up just looking at the mix of total deposits. We again think that total deposits will be relatively stable and that the mix of N. I b will be a relatively stable around that 25% you know up.\n\nUp or down part of the decline in this particular quarter ties back to some of the seasonal flows which you know are part of our trust business, but also the deposits that we knew were going to go out the door.\n\nTwo M U F G.\n\nBecause of closing down the peer point et cetera.\n\nYou know all of those things kind of tie into the reason why we saw the decline this quarter.\n\nAlright, thank you.\n\nHi.\n\nNext we'll go to John Mcdonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nHey, Jonathan it's Scott.\n\nMorning, guys wanted to ask on the idea of getting above nine by the end of the year on CET. One does that rely on the order of UA mitigation opportunities or is that just kind of the 20 to 25 basis points that Terry mentioned before the is that something that will help you next year can you talk a little bit about that.\n\nYeah, we we think that the capital generation, though the accretion that we will see of the 20th twenty-five Ah is a core earnings capability. So it does not rely on those are Debbie ways for the RW optimization that we will go through.\n\nWe'll be above and beyond that it's a part of that overall capital strategy that Andy talked about earlier.\n\nThe benefits of that should happen and help you towards the end of this year maybe into next year as you work toward end of 'twenty four capital target.\n\nYeah, it'll it'll it'll help us both this year as well into next year absolutely.\n\nAs you know as you know John we've been kind of preparing for cat Chew for you know a well over a year. We've put a lot of things are in place in the third and fourth quarter. We took some actions in the fourth quarter and will utilize a lot of those tools. If you will as part of the Rd do a optimization process. So we're going to go through.\n\n.\n\nYeah, and just to clarify Teri this hasn't happened prior to the end of 'twenty four even with the fed right. The fed would tell you on January 2024 that it would take effect.\n\nBy the end of 'twenty 'twenty four right. So it's not like they're not.\n\nCorrect.\n\nIt is correct.\n\nOkay, and then any any idea of the piece of Aoc I burned out obviously, the OCI came down 11% this quarter with the help of rates, but in a world where rates are coming down what's the natural kind of burn off paint that you might expect for that over a year or two any help on that and just kind of reminding us what the duration again.\n\nYeah, the well again the duration of the portfolio right now is about 3.8 years.\n\nSo you know just if you kind of take that into consideration the burn down will still be fairly reasonable.\n\nEven without interest rates and again, we've put some hedges into place in order to.\n\nDampen the effect of rising interest rates with respect to LCI.\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nThanks, John .\n\nNext we'll go to John from Carey with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning.\n\nOkay, Jerry Jon.\n\nOn the back.\n\nOptimization could you maybe give us a little more color on what you're looking at there I know you mentioned credit transfer some of those transfers, but maybe if you can.\n\nThe flesh that out a little bit and maybe.\n\nGood idea of the magnitude of them.\n\nThe benefit that you see potentially materializing as a result of the art of your reactions and then lastly is other business or portfolio sales or divestitures considered within there.\n\nThe second the second part of the question was.\n\nTheir business sales business sales yeah at least at this particular point in time and obviously, we'll look at we'll look at a lot of different things in terms of our businesses that we may look at to sell I mean, that's that portfolio optimization is something we're always doing and we've done that a number of different times over.\n\nLast several years. So you know that obviously will be something we'll look at but you know we have a sizable mortgage servicing rights portfolio will take a look at.\n\nYou know selling portions of that where that makes sense, we will look at asset securitization like.\n\nLike we did in the fourth quarter, you know there are a whole variety of risk transfer sort of structures that are both we put it we have put into place where you have on the shelf when we're ready to kind of start with.\n\nMoving forward on you know when we can so I think it's a whole variety of different things that we will take a look at as well as you know balancing the mix toward a growth in our what I would say cat less capital intensive businesses as opposed to capital intensive businesses. So it's a it's a it'll be a whole combination of things.\n\n.\n\nAs we move forward John .\n\nAnd do you have a way to estimate the magnitude in terms of how you're thinking about that targeted contribution from the optimization strategies.\n\nSo the you know the strategies that we have in place are reflected in the guidance that we provided so there is that would that change that and we will continue to update that guidance with given the economic conditions in rates and the scenarios that we see but as Terry mentioned this is a priority for us and we have a number of initiatives underway, which is the.\n\nRight thing to do.\n\nBecause I think capital for all banks is going to be more precious as we think about the forward regulatory environment.\n\nGot it and then just one more from me and I know you mentioned in terms of other regulatory changes potentially.\n\nPotentially coming down the Pike, you're already in the advance.\n\nIt's a proposed rule, making on the T. Lac and could you just talk about the other potential regulatory changes you see coming down the pike.\n\nOn the park I know you had mentioned the Ci efforts, but can you talk about the country run FDIC or stress capital buffer of liquidity rules anything on that front worth commenting on.\n\nYeah I mean.\n\nIt could be it could be a number of different things I mean, we talked about T. Lack I mean, just the levels of capital.\n\nDid you hear them talking about domestically significantly important banks so.\n\nIncrease in the level of the stress capital buffer is another piece of it I think another one will be around LCR and then.\n\nAnd then in the CCAR process I think that they will incorporate.\n\nYou know I would say multiple look kind of go back to what they used to do they'll have kind of multiple scenarios, but one will be kind of a what I would say a traditional sort.\n\nSort of.\n\nStress test, where you know.\n\nUnemployment goes up when rates come down another one will be more I think some foremost take place where rates stay relatively high and and you know you experienced a credit loss stress.\n\nAnd again, we've run a variety of different scenarios and I think we are.\n\nFeel like we would be able to withstand either one of those just based upon our risk profile.\n\nOkay. Thanks Terry.\n\nThanks, If I can go to chart Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning Gerard.\n\nGood morning, Terry Good morning, Andy.\n\nI have a narrower question I think it was on slide eight you guys talked about the impacts of deposits following March 8th.\n\nThe inflows that you referenced when did that come primarily in the Union bank franchise because.\n\nIt was agreed located in California, I know you guys haven't been in California, as well and then second was it more commercial versus consumer or more interest bearing versus noninterest bearing.\n\nYeah, maybe its in terms of the mix. So you know right. After March 8th we actually saw a lot of account customer opening more so on the commercial corporate side I would say probably 70% on that side as opposed to on the consumer side of the equation we saw inflows.\n\nBut again that ended up getting offset by kind of seasonal flows within corporate trust as the as the rest of the month kind of progressed.\n\nYou know the the other thing that I would say is that are you know when I look at our deposit net new customer accounts in .\n\nSpecifically in California on the consumer side, we actually saw.\n\nA nice.\n\nIncrease or pop in March.\n\nRelative to previous months, so I think that we're actually probably seen some benefits associated with that.\n\nYeah, and I think that addresses the question that you had.\n\nThank you and then over the years you guys have always done quite well and you know underwriting your your loan portfolio you show up well in the CCAR tests over the years on credit and so you don't have a very big exposure to commercial real estate and I always find it interesting to talk to banks that don't have big X.\n\nSure so a potential credit area that could be a problem. What are you guys seeing in that commercial real estate area, particularly in the office portfolio any color would be helpful.\n\nSure Gerard so.\n\nFirst of all the rest of the portfolio is very stable. If you look at our charge off rates.\n\nNon accruals.\n\nSo forth and the numbers around credit metrics. The rest of the portfolio is stable and starting to normalize but normalizing as we expected I do think the area of focus for all of US as office within real estate.\n\nAnd I do think there's some activity occurring there with tenants behavior changes sponsor behavior changes that is going to cause some pressure in the in the industry because of maybe an acceleration of what we thought was going to be a little longer process occurring more rapidly. So you can imagine that we're very focused on it as well we have not put on a lot of .\n\nOur office over the last many years, we've been very very conservative around that so as you say, we don't have a large exposure, but I do think it's an area.\n\nA lot of emphasis and focus because I do think there are going to be pressures occurring.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext we go to Iran.\n\nHer hand, putting a wallet with bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning.\n\nGood morning.\n\nFollow up question I think.\n\nIf he mentioned about.\n\nI think you'll see a hedges against if any it spike I was wondering Gary if you can elaborate on that.\n\nThe five year come back again in the last few weeks just what's the downside here school.\n\nCapital or just an increase in D. C. I spiked another 50 basis points and just talk to us in terms of the extent to which you expect to hedge against that.\n\nYeah, So again.\n\nWe've been taking a number of different actions in order to kind of dampen the effect as I said selling securities where appropriate shortening the duration.\n\nWhich you know we did a very nicely I guess in the first quarter and then putting in place you know pay fixed.\n\nSwaps against the long end of the curve. So dampening the effect of you know I'll move I meant up all of our rates in both the you know for example in the five and 10 years sort of space.\n\nYou know, we if rates moved up 50 basis points, obviously, ALC I would be impacted to some extent, but we've dampen that quite a bit.\n\nOver the course of last couple of quarters.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nJust going back to.\n\nDeposit betas, I think you talked about 40%.\n\nAll 34 this quarter I mean I'm sure you do you all do a ton of analysis on where terminal betas might end up but what's the downside risk I mean, we've obviously had a shock to the system.\n\nFunds being 5% plus what's the how do you handicap, the risk that 40% beta actually turning out to be something much higher than maybe closer to 50%.\n\nYeah, you know, we've we've done a lot of different analysis and you know I mean, you are right you know the competition.\n\nFor deposits is getting stronger we've kind of taken that into consideration.\n\nWe're seeing over 5% in some markets.\n\nGenerally it is a smaller banks are where that is occurring community markets those sorts of things and.\n\nThat's because for those entities that's their primary source of funding.\n\nAnd and so you know that that's going to occur, but you know all of that has been kind of taken into consideration in terms of.\n\nLooking at that 40% deposit beta.\n\nIf you end up looking at our business.\n\nAgain in terms of who we end up competing against et cetera.\n\nBut you know what we end up looking at and tracking is especially on the institutional corporate side of the equation is money market.\n\nrates and those sorts of and and all sorts of things you know right now that's kind of in the high fours.\n\nAnd our deposit pricing is very competitive with that.\n\nWhich is why it gives us confidence with respect to both flows and the deposit betas that we've articulated.\n\nBut I mean, you don't see a major shift in consumer and retail deposit pricing today versus maybe at the start of the year.\n\nYeah, it's gonna depend I mean, obviously it depends upon the the rates environment I mean, if the fed for example goes up another 50 or 100 basis points from here.\n\nThat would put more pressure on deposit betas, but you know if you end up looking at the market implied or.\n\nEven even up a bit.\n\nI still feel pretty comfortable with where we're at.\n\nGot it thank you.\n\nMhm.\n\nAnd next we'll go to Matt O'connor with Peoria Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning, Matt.\n\nIt's Deutsche Bank.\n\nYou got a very strong reserves to loans on a stated basis I guess first can you remind us what the impact is if you adjusted for the Union Bank loans that were market fair value. When you took them on.\n\nIf you have that handy.\n\nYeah, I I missed the very first part of the question Andy to you I think Mike you are trying to understand are you trying to understand the union.\n\nUnion Bank has an impact on our reserve to loans ratio than what it is I don't think it has a major impact not a significant one.\n\nOkay, and then just broadly speaking like as you think about that.\n\nThe rest of the year I mean, you're obviously, taking your best guess on reserves.\n\nHey, Matt and your thoughts on.\n\nOkay.\n\nSorry, Yeah, sorry, yeah, it's hard to hear you.\n\nYeah.\n\nSorry can you hear me better now.\n\nThank you Matt.\n\nOkay, sorry about that I was just asking about the outlook for the loan loss reserve.\n\nI'm here.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo you know our expectation is that again, Andy has talked about the fact that we're preparing for any economic sort of outcome that might exist.\n\nThey gave you end up looking at the consensus in the marketplace. You know some form of recession, probably a softer or moderate sort of recession late this year early next year.\n\nIf you look at the market implied I would kind of.\n\nNo tie into that where do we go through our reserving process, we looked at multiple scenarios.\n\nWe wait to the Conservative side, you know, we look at five different scenarios, we make.\n\nAssumptions with respect to that.\n\nOnly 35% of its Oh.\n\nWeighted toward what I would call the base case.\n\nAnd the rest of it is downside so we feel pretty good about where we're in reserve levels or are you know obviously, if we saw economic shock are above and beyond kind of what is being expected that might be a little bit different but we feel pretty good about you know.\n\nHow we're thinking about it.\n\nOkay, Great and then maybe if I could just squeeze in on a spending trends throughout you guys through your payments business, obviously see a lot just any observations on kind of trends throughout the quarter and maybe any comments so far in April . Thank you.\n\nYeah.\n\nOur payments business you know, we continue to see a pretty strong sales you know.\n\n10, plus percent for example in our payments our merchant processing business are very strong.\n\nMid to mid to high single digits with respect to our corporate payments business.\n\nYou know the if.\n\nIf you end up comparing any of these things to pre pandemic as you know through the rough.\n\nSo we continue to see a good spend in the business I would say that after the market disruption.\n\nThere was a bit more softness in retail sales, which we're going to continue to watch it's really too early to tell whether or not that's a trend or whether that was really.\n\nSome of the concerns around the market disruption, but we'll continue to watch that Andy what would you add.\n\nIt's still growing a math, but it's just growing at a lower rate.\n\nParticularly in retail airline spend continues to be very very high which is a little bit of the reason that we have a differential between sales growth and revenue growth because the airlines spread is a little thinner. So travel continues to be strong retail came down a bit but still growing.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nSure.\n\nNext we can go to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer Oppenheimer and company. Please go ahead, yeah. Good morning, Chris.\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nYou've given us a lot of good detail on the a F. S side I'm just wondering if you could discuss a little bit you know how are you.\n\nYou anticipate managing the held to maturity portfolio do you also.\n\nPlan to let that kind of burned down.\n\nAnd and shorten and I'm curious just given that it's a lot of mortgage backs and that their principal payments each month, how how quickly does that portfolio of burn down or do you see the need to maintain a lot lot of duration there.\n\nIn case, we get a another decline in rates.\n\nYeah, Yeah, I mean, obviously, we look at both sides of the equation the the burn down on the HTM side, just simply because of the nature of it is really more tied to you know how quickly you see payoffs and what the duration of that.\n\nEnds up looking at Oh, I I think as we are as we look at.\n\nThe size of the investment portfolio et cetera will will take into consideration what level of duration, we want to have.\n\nThat in the in the HTM portfolio, but that's going to be more of a function of just paydowns and payoffs overtime.\n\nYeah, but I mean, just I guess question Directionally in the next couple of quarters there.\n\nYou you, probably let let the duration shorten and the size of the portfolio of burn down left here.\n\nYeah, Yeah, absolutely yeah, Okay alright.\n\nAlright, that's it for me thank you.\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nExcellent can you spend with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah.\n\nOh, Hey, guys. Good morning first question I just wanted to ask you.\n\nOn credit on an adjusted basis your charge offs were 30 basis points this quarter and part of the comments you made earlier about CRE and some of the data we see in the release about delinquencies and NPA is increasing.\n\nWhat's your outlook for charge offs as we go forward.\n\nThe 30 basis point that we saw in the first.\n\nYeah, I mean, our expectation is that that 30 basis will continue to normalize throughout the year and into 2024.\n\nProbably on a similar sort of pace are you know.\n\nI think it was 23 basis points in.\n\nIn the fourth quarter. So I think that that will continue to kind of move up as the year progresses.\n\nJust the power of normalization.\n\nUnderstood on that Okay, and then just coming back to the full year Guide obviously, you made a modest adjustment, which is well expected given the change in the rate outlook.\n\nWe we can back into that I think it's mostly on the NII side, just given that that's where it seemingly some of the changes were versus the prior outlook, but can you just kind of refresh us and just give us kind of just some underlying thoughts of NII growth versus fee growth and any changes you have if any on the fee side versus your prior outlook. Thank you.\n\nSure.\n\nTo your point most of the changes were in NII and it's a function of the rate curve the rate environment, the expectation about rate increases as well as the deposit pricing to Terry made reference to in the beta is approaching 40%. So most of the change was in NII.\n\nOkay and then so just last follow up so then embedded in your fee outlook for the year is pretty decent growth. It would seem then and are you expecting that to still be mostly driven by.\n\nBy the payments business or are there other areas that youre expecting to see some good growth then.\n\nWe have a great diversity of revenue sources and they are all doing well so payments as you know.\n\nApproaching double digits, 9% year over year basis, as Terry talked about spend levels are good we had a bang up quarter in our commercial products group across the categories and that is doing just terrifically in this environment and just driving revenue growth as well trust is doing well so and mortgage.\n\nYou know that's the value of a diverse revenue stream. There are many different sources of revenue and fee income.\n\nGot it understood. Thanks, guys.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext we'll go to Vivek with J P. Morgan.\n\nHi.\n\nHi, Andy had Terry a couple of just clarifications I think you had mentioned that accretion from the deal Andy is going better.\n\nThan you had expected any I know you've talked a lot just trying to pull this all together, where you're seeing it better thus far.\n\nYeah, So and we talked about this or that came out in the fourth quarter that the expectation of that 8% garnered or 11%.\n\nAnd the return the returns actually better so if I look at it in the Big picture when we initially thought about the deal.\n\nUnion Bank had a $2 9 billion dollar or so revenue base and a $2 six or so billion dollars $2 3 billion dollar expense base. So 600 P PNR and you'd look at the first quarter and it's double that so.\n\nThe revenues are stronger principally because of the value of deposits in this rate environment.\n\nThe expenses are a little less and our expectations on our efficiencies are continuing to be on plan. So all that adds up to a higher accretion.\n\nOkay and that higher accretion that higher accretion is.\n\nThe net the net purchase accounting is actually negative given the right core deposit intangibles. So it's very strong.\n\nRight and that's before you even finished the integration back to you.\n\nThat's locked in the second quarter anyway.\n\nYeah, that's right that's correct.\n\nAlright, thank you.\n\nOoh.",
    "content2": "Next we'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS.\n\nYes, sorry to prolong the call I just had one follow up question and Andy I I ask the question a compound way I apologize, but if you think about creating to over 9% in E. T line by.\n\nBy year end, and how would you stack rank dividend growth is a priority.\n\nDividend growth continues to be a priority Erika. So our expectation is we would have continued growth in the dividend the dividend growth numbers not hugely material to the capital accretion math.\n\nIf you go through the numbers on that that is a relatively small component of a negative.\n\nDownturn in capital so.\n\nThat expectation that I talked about includes the expectation of a strong dividend.\n\nThank you.\n\nSure.\n\nAnd next well go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nHey, Mike Hi, Hey, last quarter, you mentioned your reserves more for an environment with 6% unemployment I was wondering if you had an update for that and given seasonal accounting does that mean.\n\nYour reserving done before the recession has even started or how do you think about that and what about the release of reserves and extend the stay that low charge off range, even with some of the normalization.\n\nYeah, well, I think well wait and see what ends up happening given the uncertainty that's in the economy regarding the last bit of it but yeah. No. We had said that it was the weighted average at the peak was a peak quarter was about a little over 6% it's.\n\nIt's about five nine today is kind of what are our weighted average case kind of comes up too so very similar to what we had before.\n\nOkay and your.\n\nYour outlook for the economy soft recession hard landing.\n\nWhat's your thinking.\n\nSo Mike we expect a soft recession, a moderate recession later half of this year, but as Jerry mentioned our CSO.\n\nCounting is assuming a sort of a two thirds downturn one third base case. So we are we have reserved to a little bit more downward scenario.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nYou bet.\n\nAnd we have no further questions at this time I will now turn it back to George Anderson. Please continue.\n\nThank you if you listen to our call. Please contact the Investor Relations Department, if you have any follow up questions.\n\nAnd this concludes today's conference. Thanks for participating you may now disconnect.\n\nWe're sorry your conferences ending now please hang up."

Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Central Time.\nI will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nIR Officer, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.\nI would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, our Form 10-K and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC.\nFollowing their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.\nI'll begin on Slide 3. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank on December 1. In the fourth quarter, we reported $0.57 per diluted share or $1.20 after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. This was a complex quarter that included 1 month of Union Bank results, merger integration charges and balance sheet optimization activity. Terry will provide more details on these notable items.\nImportantly, we ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.4%, which was just above our expected level at deal close, and we delivered positive operating leverage for U.S. Bancorp legacy operations of 230 basis points for the full year. Strong year-over-year pretax provision income growth, as adjusted for notable items, was driven by net interest income growth and positive operating leverage. Credit quality remains strong, although credit metrics are starting to normalize as expected.\nSlide 4 details our reported and adjusted income statement results as well as end-of-period balances and other performance metrics. End-of-period assets for the company totaled $675 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Union Bank and certain balance sheet optimization actions.\nSlide 5 highlights key performance ratios. This quarter, we delivered a return on average assets of 1.2%, a return of average common equity of 16.8% and a return on tangible common equity of 23.4%, each as adjusted for notable items.\nTurning to Slide 6. The completion of the Union Bank acquisition marked a significant milestone for our company. With double-digit percent increases in loan and deposit balances, Union Bank adds meaningful scale to our business that enables us to better serve our customers and communities.\nUnion contributes considerable small business and consumer market share in a demographically attractive California market. And we're excited about the potential to deepen existing Union Bank relationships by overlaying our leading digital capabilities and robust product set, including wealth management, consumer and business banking and payments offerings, across a loyal but under-penetrated consumer base.\nIn many ways, this deal underscores our commitment to creating a stronger, more competitive regional banking organization in a rapidly evolving environment. One of the more attractive aspects of this transaction is Union Bank's high-quality, low-cost consumer deposit franchise, which will support continued loan growth and margins.\nLet me turn the call over now to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter.\n\nTerrance R. Dolan\n\nCFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy.\nIf you turn to Slide 7, as Andy mentioned, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter or $1.20 per share after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. Notable items related to Union Bank acquisition are comprised of 3 primary elements that reduced earnings per share by $0.63 related to balance sheet optimization, merger and integration costs, and the impacts of -- on provision expense related to acquired loans and actions taken to optimize the balance sheet.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the company recognized a onetime $399 million pretax loss on a net basis related to several actions taken to optimize the balance sheet, manage the net -- the interest rate volatility impact on capital levels and position the company for future growth. Subsequent to obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, we entered into interest rate hedges to manage rate volatility and its related impact on regulatory capital from the date of approval through the closing of the transaction in December.\nDuring that time frame, long-term interest rates increased nearly 50 basis points before declining approximately 65 basis points. The interest rate swaps were terminated at the time of closing, and the losses recognized through earnings largely offset the interest rate marks recorded into the balance sheet through purchase accounting.\nIn addition, the company optimized its balance sheet by selling certain loans and repositioning its investment portfolio on certain equity investments. Within noninterest expenses, we incurred merger- and integration-related charges of $90 million that primarily included the impact of specific deal closing costs, professional services and employee-related expenses.\nWe also incurred a $791 million charge to the provision for credit losses, which reflects an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and a net loss of $129 million related to the securitization of approximately $4 billion of legacy indirect auto loans. Again, these moves enabled us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns.\nSlide 8 provides a more detailed earnings summary. Union Bank, which was included in our consolidated results for 1 month, contributed $302 million of revenue, $221 million of noninterest expenses, $81 million of operating income and $44 million of net income to the company, representing $0.03 per diluted share.\nOn Slide 9, end-of-period loans increased 13.3% on a linked-quarter basis to $388 billion, which included core loan growth and acquired loans from Union Bank. Union Bank contributed ending loan balances of $54 billion, net of purchase accounting adjustments, partly offset by a reduction in balances of $15 billion related to balance sheet optimization actions, including loan sales and securitizations.\nSlide 10 provides end-of-period deposit balance composition. End-of-period deposits increased 11.4% on a linked-quarter basis to $525 billion driven by the acquisition, which contributed $86 billion of lower-cost deposits and actions taken as a result of the deal to optimize our funding sources. On a core basis, we saw deposit balances decline slightly this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 11. The investment securities portfolio grew 4.2% linked quarter to $170 billion. The addition of securities from Union Bank were offset by balance sheet optimization actions.\nSlide 12 highlights revenue trends. Adjusted net revenue totaled $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which included revenue contribution of $302 million from Union Bank, primarily representing net interest income. For legacy U.S. Bancorp, net interest income grew 5.5% on a linked-quarter basis and 29.2% year-over-year, driven by strong earning asset growth and net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates. Results were partially offset by higher deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs.\nNoninterest income, as adjusted for the legacy company, declined 3.0% compared to the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower payment service revenue and lower commercial product revenue, offset by stronger mortgage banking revenue. Year-over-year, legacy adjusted noninterest income declined 5.5%, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue from reduced refinancing activity and lower servicing charges, offset by stronger payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees.\nTurning to Slide 13. Adjusted noninterest expense totaled $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter, including $221 million from Union Bank. Included in expenses was approximately $42 million of intangible amortization due to core deposit intangibles established at the time of the acquisition.\nLegacy noninterest expense, as adjusted, increased 3.8% on a linked-quarter basis, largely driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as higher expenses related to professional services, marketing, technology and tax credit amortization.\nSlide 14 shows credit quality trends. We reported total net charge-offs for the quarter of $578 million. After adjusting for acquisition impacts and the balance sheet optimization activities, net charge-offs totaled $210 million or 23 -- 0.23% of average loans, up from 0.19% in the third quarter, which reflected the continuing normalization of credit losses.\nNonperforming assets for the legacy bank increased slightly, while Union Bank contributed $329 million to the total. On a combined basis, the reported ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.26% at December 31 compared with 0.20% at September 30 and 0.28% a year ago, reflecting a continued strong credit quality.\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.19 billion, which included a provision of $791 million related to the acquisition and balance sheet optimization activities. This provision includes an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and $129 million related to our balance sheet optimization activities. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31 totaled $7.4 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans, which reflects increased economic uncertainty and the incorporation of the Union Bank portfolio.\nSlide 15 highlights the drivers of our linked-quarter common equity Tier 1 capital position. As of December 31, our CET1 capital ratio was 8.4%. Acquisition impacts of 180 basis points included an increase in goodwill and other intangible assets that reflected the impact of credit and interest rate marks, the initial provision for credit losses, balance sheet optimization actions as well as the increase in risk-weighted assets with the addition of Union Bank. These impacts were partially offset by an increase to equity related to shares issued to MUFG as part of the purchase price of Union Bank.\nSlide 16 provides our current expectations of certain financial metrics related to the transaction. The financial and strategic merits of the deal remain intact and are very attractive. Earnings per share accretion is now expected to be 8% to 9% in 2023, which is higher than originally estimated. While our tangible book value per share dilution is higher than initially estimated due to the significant impact of rising interest rates on the interest rate marks at close, our estimated earn-back period is only slightly longer than our original estimate at 2 years versus our original estimate of 1.5 years.\nSlide 17 provides a comparison of credit and net fair value marks from the time of our announcement to closing. Credit marks are lower due to favorable changes in portfolio composition and credit quality, partially offset by economic deterioration. Interest rate marks, inclusive of loans, securities net of sales and debt, are higher than anticipated at announcement due to higher interest rates, but we expect that to accrete quickly back through earnings.The core deposit intangible is also higher than originally estimated, reflecting the increased value of low cost -- lower-cost core deposits in a higher rate environment.\nI will now provide first quarter and full year 2023 forward-looking guidance, which is provided on Slide 18. Starting with the first quarter 2023 guidance, we expect average earning assets of between $605 billion and $610 billion in the first quarter and a net interest margin that is 5 to 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter level. Total revenue is estimated to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, including approximately $100 million of purchase accounting accretion during the quarter.\nTotal noninterest expense, as adjusted, is expected to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, inclusive of approximately $125 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our income tax rate, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable-equivalent basis. We anticipate merger and integration charges of between $200 million and $250 million for the quarter.\nI will now provide guidance for the full year. For 2023, average earning assets are expected to be in the range of $610 billion to $620 billion with net interest margin expansion of between 5 to 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $29 billion to $31 billion, inclusive of between $350 million to $400 million of full year purchase accounting accretion.\nTotal noninterest expense, as adjusted for the year, is expected to be in the range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis, as adjusted, will be approximately 22% to 23%. We expect to have $900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023.\nI will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Terry. We accomplished a lot this past year, including the completion of the Union Bank acquisition and a strong legacy PPNR growth supported by positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. Union Bank adds significant scale to our business and deepens our commitment to serving customers and creating economic opportunities for communities across the West Coast.\nWe continue to target a Memorial Day weekend systems conversion, incorporating a lift-and-shift approach to our applications, which mitigates risk and allows us to more quickly capture meaningful cost synergies. There is still a tremendous amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and we are preparing for any scenario. I believe we will perform well because of the strength of our business, a strong balance sheet and the great team we have.\nAs we've proven during previous economic downturns, our business model is resilient and recession-ready in large part due to our disciplined through-the-cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. Our consumer clients are predominantly prime, super prime, and our commercial book is generally investment-grade, and we have very little leverage lending commitments.\nWe are focused on prudent balance sheet growth, high-return, high-margin opportunities and the prudent allocation of capital to lines of business and products best served to deliver on our strategic objectives. Our growth strategy is focused on creating value for our customers, communities and shareholders, which allow us to generate industry-leading performance.\nLet me close by saying thank you to our 77,000 employees across the company, including our newest colleagues from Union Bank. Your dedication and commitment are what make U.S. Bank special and the destination of choice for all the constituents we serve.\nWe'll now open up the call for Q&A.",

Welcome to the U.S. Bancorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 a.m. Central Time.\nI will now turn the conference over to George Andersen, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nGeorge Andersen\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.\nI would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have. And I'll begin on Slide 3.\nIn the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.16, which included $0.02 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.18 for the quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved record net revenue totaling $6.3 billion. Third quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth, well-controlled expenses and stable credit quality.\nThis quarter, we added $200 million to our loan loss reserve, reflecting loan growth and our consistent through-the-cycle underwriting approach to risk management. At September 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%. Our tangible book value per share totaled $20.73 at September 30 or 3.2% lower than the prior quarter driven by the impact of rising interest rates on our available-for-sale securities.\nSlide 4 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, we delivered a return on average assets of 1.24% and a return on average common equity of 16.2%. Our return on tangible common equity was 21.4% on a core basis.\nSlide 5 highlights continued positive trends in digital engagement as consumer and business customers gain a deeper understanding of our digital capabilities and benefit from our digital-plus-human approach.\nSlide 6 shows progress across our digital and payments initiatives that are both deepening our core competencies and expanding our competitive advantage, which we believe will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation to our company. One example of our digital initiatives is our launch of talech Register, a next-generation, all-in-one payments and business analytics platform that is helping to bring greater simplicity, convenience and efficiencies to the point of sale for our business banking customers.\nOn the right side of the slide, you can see the continuing momentum we are gaining in real-time payments transactions. Year-to-date through September 30, the total number of transactions are 17x higher than the full year 2020. Recently reintroduced an innovative, real-time payment solution to auto dealers, where we provide loan funds instantly after a loan contract is finalized. This gives our participating dealer clients greater control of their cash flow and helps to improve their day-to-day operational efficiency.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our business banking initiative continues to gain traction with steady progress both in growing accounts and expanding wallet share. Growth in relationships with both banking and payments products has continued to meaningfully outpace growth in total relationships over the past 12 months. Looking ahead, we expect recently launched and innovative offerings in development to help further deepen our existing relationships between business banking and payments customers.\nNow let me turn the call over to Terry, who'll provide more detail on the quarter.\n\nTerrance R. Dolan\n\nCFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 8, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.9% compared with the second quarter driven by 6.5% growth in commercial loans, 4.7% growth in mortgage loans and 6.0% growth in credit card balances. Commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large corporate and middle market portfolios. Underlying demand remains healthy as we continue to focus on appropriate return opportunities to prudently deploy our capital.\nIn the retail portfolio, we saw solid linked quarter growth and year-over-year growth in credit card balances, reflecting strong spending activity and lower payment rates. Purchase mortgage market share gains and lower prepayment activity continued to support residential mortgage balance growth.\nTurning to Slide 9. Total average deposits increased slightly compared to the second quarter. Growth in total interest-bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower total noninterest-bearing deposit balances as customers respond to the rising interest rate environment. Total average deposits increased by 5.9% compared to a year ago.\nSlide 10 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong across our loan portfolio. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.20% at September 30 compared with 0.23% at June 30 and 0.32% a year ago.\nOur third quarter charge-off ratio of 0.19% improved slightly versus the second quarter of 2022 and third quarter of 2021 levels. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.5 billion or 1.88% of period-end loans. The $200 million increase in our reserve this quarter was primarily reflective of loan growth and, to a lesser extent, uncertainties in the economic outlook.\nSlide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter, we reported $1.18 per share, excluding $0.02 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank.\nTurning to Slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.9 billion, representing an 11.3% increase compared with the second quarter and a 20.6% increase from a year ago. Linked quarter growth was driven by strong earning asset growth and a 24 basis point increase in the net interest margin, which benefited from rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs.\nSlide 13 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 3.1% on a linked quarter basis as declines in mortgage banking and treasury management revenues were partially offset by stronger corporate payments revenue and an increase in other noninterest revenue. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income declined 8.3% primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, reduced deposit service charges reflecting changes in our policies and lower treasury management fees due to rising rates, partially offset by higher payments revenue and trust and investment management fees.\nThe decline in mortgage revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market, which continued to pressure total application volumes and the related gain-on-sale margins given excess industry capacity. In the third quarter, total payments revenue increased by 4.9% compared with the year earlier.\nSlide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our 3 payments businesses. Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are a better indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment. Credit and debit card fee revenue increased -- or decreased 0.5% on a year-over-year basis as the impact of higher credit card and debit card volume was more than offset by continued lower prepaid card activity.\nExcluding prepaid card activity, which was elevated last year in connection with supporting unemployment programs, credit and debit card fee revenue would have increased 3.0% compared with the third quarter of 2021.\nThe bottom half of the slide illustrates the year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue over the last several quarters. Third quarter merchant processing revenue increased 3.6% year-over-year. Growth was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates given market volatility in Europe and specifically in the U.K. Excluding the FX impact, year-over-year growth in merchant fee revenue was approximately 9.4%.\nSlide 15 provides some additional information on our Payment Services business. On the right side of the slide, you will see the continued strong momentum we are seeing in our tech-led revenue and partnerships within our merchant acquiring business. The key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new tech-led partnerships. Through the third quarter, new tech-led partnerships year-to-date were 2.5x the number of new partnerships we acquired in the entire year of 2019, and these partnerships are continuing to grow.\nTurning to Slide 16. Noninterest expense increased 1.9% on a linked quarter basis, excluding merger and integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of Union Bank. The change in expense was driven by higher compensation, professional services and marketing and business development expenses.\nSlide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 common -- our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 9.7%.\nOn Slide 18, I'll provide some forward-looking guidance for U.S. Bank on a stand-alone basis. Again, this guidance does not include any potential impact of Union Bank. Let me start with full year 2022 guidance, which is consistent with our previous expectations. We continue to expect total net revenue to increase 5% to 6% in 2022 compared to 2021. We expect mid-teen growth in taxable equivalent net interest income, which has slightly improved from our previous outlook of low to mid-teens growth.\nWe continue to expect a decline in fee revenue for the full year, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on mortgage revenue due to lower refinancings in the market, lower deposit service charges due to pricing changes and a decline in other noninterest income.\nWe continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022, excluding the impact of merger and integration-related costs associated with the Union Bank acquisition. For the full year of 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.\nI'll now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect both total revenue and total core expenses, excluding merger and integration costs, to increase by approximately 2% on a linked quarter basis. Net interest income will continue to be supported by earning asset growth and higher rates. However, our fee revenue will be lower, reflecting typical seasonality in some of our fee-based businesses.\nCredit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical levels but to normalize over time. Changes in the allowance for credit losses near term will primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook.\nIf you turn to Slide 19, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continue to make significant progress in planning for the closing of the deal in the fourth quarter of 2022 while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal.\nAs a reminder, we expect to close on the deal approximately 45 days after being granted U.S. regulatory approval. As previously discussed, we are targeting a conversion date in the first half of 2023. The financial merits of the deal remain intact. Our EPS accretion estimates are unchanged, and we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately 20%, which is well above our cost of capital.\nThe company's target CET1 capital ratio is 8.5%. Based on interest rates as of October 13, our CET1 capital ratio at close would approximately -- would approximate 8.3%. We expect the CET ratio to increase towards 9% as the purchase accounting valuation adjustments accrete into capital through earnings.\nI'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Terry. The advances we have made and continue to make across our business lines are paying off in terms of improved customer experience, new customer acquisition and deeper relationships. Expense management is a priority, and we continue to target positive operating leverage in 2022 and beyond.\nWe look forward to closing on the Union Bank acquisition pending regulatory approval. This is a unique opportunity at scale in one of our core markets, and we remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of the deal.\nThe credit -- the current credit environment is benign. In fact, our net charge-off ratio in the third quarter remain near historic lows, and we are not seeing any meaningful early-stage metrics that causes concern. That being said, we recognize the pressure points are building in several areas of the economy that could lead to stress in the future.\nBorrowing costs are increasing, inflation is high, saving rates are starting to decline, and the stock market is well off its highs. So while the backdrop is favorable today, it would not be surprising to us to see an economic slowdown develop at some point driven by lower confidence levels, which may lead to reduced spending and business investment.\nThere are a number of scenarios that may play out over the next several quarters. We are preparing for a range of possible outcomes by prudently managing credit, liquidity and capital so that we continue to grow within our through-the-cycle risk management framework and deliver industry-leading returns.\nIn summary, our investments are paying off. We remain diligent stewards of capital. Our balance sheet is strong, and our focus is firmly fixed on managing the company for the long term.\nI'll close by saying thank you to our employees. Your hard work and focus in doing the right thing for our customers and communities every day is recognized and appreciated.\nWe'll now open it up to Q&A.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Central Time.\nI will now turn the call over to Jen Thompson, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. You may go ahead, Jen.\n\nJennifer Ann Thompson\n\nExecutive VP and Director of IR & Economic Analysis, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.\nI'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty.

Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have.\nI'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99, which included $0.10 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.09. We achieved record net revenue this quarter totaling $6 billion.\nSecond quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth, driven by robust net interest income and fee revenue and stable credit quality. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in earning assets and the benefit of rising rates as well as good underlying business activity and customer acquisition trends across our fee businesses.\nAdditionally, our multiyear investments in digital payments and technology are paying off in the form of strong top line growth and enhanced efficiency. This quarter, we added $150 million to our loan loss reserve, reflecting strong loan growth and our consistent through-the-cycle approach to risk management. Our credit quality remains strong, and we are not seeing any trends in early-stage metrics that cause us concern.\nAt June 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%. Based on the results of the Federal Reserve's 2022 stress test that were published in June, we announced that we expect to be subject to a preliminary stress capital buffer of 2.5%, unchanged from the current level. We believe our industry-leading results demonstrate our ability to withstand a severe economic downturn, which is a testament to the strength, quality and diversity of our balance sheet and our prudent approach to managing risk.\nSlide 4 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was 1.16% and our return on average common equity was 15.3%. Our return on tangible common equity was 20.5% on a core basis. Slide 5 highlights digital trends in engagement.\nI'll now turn to Slide 6. We believe our digital capabilities and our complete payments ecosystem are competitive advantages that will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation for our company over the next several years. Our state-of-the-art digital capabilities have not only created a more effective and valuable experience for our customers, but they have allowed us to expand our distribution reach beyond our physical infrastructure while optimizing our existing branch network.\nOn the left side, you will see that the success we are having with our State Farm partnership, which is driving more customers, more loans and more deposits to our platform in a cost-effective way. The chart in the middle highlights the strong trends, the uptake of our talech point-of-sale functionality, which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple, easy-to-use format that we provide in the form of a dashboard. And on the right, you'll see the momentum we are gaining in real-time payments transactions, which, through the midyear 2022, are 10x higher than the total number of transactions we saw for the entirety of 2020.\nWe are excited about the secular growth opportunities we see across all of our business lines, but I'd like -- but one area I'd like to highlight on Slide 7 is our business banking initiative, which is really starting to gain traction. On the left chart, you'll see that the opportunity we have previously discussed to connect our banking customers with our payments, products and services and our payments customers with our banking products and services.\nThe chart on the right shows the progress we are making in growing accounts and expanding wallet share. Growth and relationships with both banking and payments products has meaningfully outpaced growth in total relationships over the past 12 months. And it's worth noting, we are still in the early innings.\nNow let me turn the call over to Terry, who'll provide more detail on the quarter.\n\nTerrance R. Dolan\n\nCFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 8, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.6% compared to the first quarter, driven by a 6.9% growth in commercial loans, 4.1% growth in credit card and 3.6% growth in mortgage loans.\nCommercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large corporate and middle market portfolios. Pipelines are strong going into the third quarter, and working capital needs remain elevated.\nIn the retail portfolio, we saw good growth in credit card balances, reflecting strong spending activity and typical seasonal trends. Purchase mortgage market share gains and lower prepayment activity continue to support residential mortgage balance growth.\nTurning to Slide 9. Total average deposits increased by 0.5% compared with the first quarter. Growth in interest-bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, reflecting the rising interest rate environment. Total average deposits increased by 6.4% compared with a year ago.\nSlide 10 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong across our loan portfolios. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.23% at June 30 compared with 0.25% at March 31 and 0.36% a year ago. Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.20% improved slightly versus the first quarter level of 0.21% and was lower compared with the second quarter of 2021 level of 0.25%.\nCredit performance across our commercial and retail portfolios continues to be strong. On a linked quarter basis, both early and late-stage delinquencies decreased for the total portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30 totaled $6.3 billion or 1.88% of period-end loans.\nSlide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter, we reported $1.09 per diluted share, excluding $0.10 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank.\nTurning to Slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.5 billion, representing an 8.3% increase compared with the first quarter and a 9.5% increase from a year ago. Linked quarter growth was driven by strong earning asset growth and a 15 basis point increase in the net interest margin.\nSlide 13 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 6.3% on a linked quarter basis but declined by 2.7% from a year ago as lower mortgage banking revenue more than offset strong performance in other fee businesses.\nThe decline in mortgage banking revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market, which continues to pressure total application volumes and related gain on sale margins. In the second quarter, total payment fee revenue increased by 9.7% compared with the year earlier, reflecting strong underlying business trends, supported by investments we are making.\nSlide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our 3 payments businesses. Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are a better indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment.\nCredit and debit card revenue increased 0.8% on a year-over-year basis as the impact of higher credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card revenue, credit and debit card revenue -- fee revenue would have increased 10.1% compared with the second quarter of 2021. Year-over-year credit and debit card revenue growth rates continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in prepaid card revenue as the benefit of government stimulus has dissipated.\nWe provide detail on prepaid card revenue over the past 5 quarters in the upper right-hand quadrant. While prepaid card revenue is approaching a run rate on a linked quarter basis, it will impact year-over-year credit and debit card revenue comparisons through the end of 2022.\nThe bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payment fee revenue over the past last several quarters. While we expect the year-over-year growth rates to moderate from current levels, we continue to believe that both merchant processing and credit and corporate payment fee revenue can grow at a high single-digit pace on a year-over-year basis in a post-pandemic environment.\nSlide 15 provides some additional information on our Payment Services businesses. On the right side of the slide, you can see there the strong momentum we are seeing in tech-led revenue growth within our merchant acquiring business.\nIn the second quarter, tech-led merchant revenue, which accounted for 27% of the total merchant acquiring revenue was 13% higher than a year ago and 43% higher than the comparable 2019 period. A key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new tech-led partnerships. In the second quarter, new tech-led partnerships totaled 1.6x the number of new partnerships we acquired for the entire year of 2019, and we continue to add to that customer distribution baseline.\nTurning to Slide 16. Noninterest expense increased by 0.7% on a linked quarter basis, excluding merger and integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of Union Bank. The change in expense was driven by higher compensation expense, marketing and business development expense and other noninterest expenses, partially offset by lower employee benefit expense and other expense categories. The higher compensation expense was driven by the impact of seasonal merit increases and 1 additional day in the quarter as well as variable compensation tied to revenue growth.\nSlide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30 was 9.7%. As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we suspended our share buyback program due to the pending acquisition of Union Bank. After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 8.5%. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our CET1 ratio reaches 9.0% following the pending deal close.\nOn Slide 18, I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance for U.S. Bank on a stand-alone basis. This guidance does not include any potential impact from Union Bank. Let me start with the full year 2022 guidance.\nWe have updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with the market expectations. We continue to expect total net revenue to increase 5.6% compared with 2021. Given our revised interest rate assumptions, we now expect low to mid-teen growth in taxable equivalent net interest income compared with our previous estimate of 8% to 11%.\nWe expect higher rates to pressure mortgage application volumes more than previously anticipated, which will negatively impact our mortgage banking revenue. We now expect fee income to be slightly lower for the full year of 2022 compared with our previous expectation that fee revenue would be stable.\nWe continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022, excluding the impact of merger and integration-related costs associated with the Union Bank transaction. For the full year of 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.\nNow I'll provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to grow 3% to 5% on a linked quarter basis. In the third quarter, we expect linked quarter noninterest expense growth of 2.3%, excluding merger and integration-related costs, as we prepare for the Union Bank transaction.\nCredit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical levels but will continue to normalize over time. Adjustments to our loan loss reserve in the near term will primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook.\nIf you turn to Slide 19, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank.\nWe continue to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal in the second half of 2022 while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal.\nAs a reminder, we expect to close on the deal approximately 45 days after being granted U.S. regulatory approval. Because this timing would likely indicate a late third quarter or early fourth quarter close, we believe it is prudent to shift the system conversion date to the first half of 2023.\nThe financial merits of the deal remain intact. Our original EPS accretion estimates are unchanged. And we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately 20%, which is well above our cost of capital.\nI'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Terry. Our second quarter results were supported by solid account growth, deepening of existing relationships and strong business activity across our banking and fee business lines, and we are well positioned as we head into the second half of the year. Credit quality remains strong, and we continue to prudently manage operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives, our payments capabilities and in our technology modernization.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our employees for all they do, and we look forward to welcoming Union Bank employees to our company. I remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of this transaction and the meaningful benefits that will accrue to our customers, our communities as well as our shareholders.\nWe will now open up the call to Q&A.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Central Time through Thursday, April 21, 2022, at 10:59 p.m Central Time. .\nI will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nJennifer Ann Thompson\n\nExecutive VP and Director of IR & Economic Analysis, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, [Francie], and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.\nI'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.\nI'll now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have.\nI'll begin on Slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99 and total revenue of $5.6 billion. The quarter was highlighted by strong loan growth, continued momentum in our payments businesses, well-controlled expenses and strong credit quality. As expected, mortgage banking revenue declined in the first quarter due to slower refinancing activity in the market. However, we saw a good momentum in business activity and related revenue growth within other fee businesses, including payments, trust and investment management and treasury management. This quarter, we released $50 million in loan loss reserves, reflecting continued strong credit quality. And at March 31, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.8%.\nSlide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the first quarter, we delivered a return on assets of 1.09% and a return on tangible common equity of 16.6%. Slide 5 highlights strengths in digital engagement. Digital transactions account for over 80% of total transactions and total digital loan sales account for about 2/3 of total loan sales. We are pleased with the progress we have seen so far, but believe there is further opportunity to increase customer engagement through digital adoption by helping customers, consumers and business customers to understand the full scope of capabilities available to assist them in managing their financial lives.\nWe are continually adding and enhancing digital features and functionality and applying a digital plus human approach. A great example of this is our Do-it-Together co-browse technology. Through this tool, interactions with our customers, a key driver of engagements have increased in number and have become more efficient as well as effective.\nTurning to Slide 6. We believe our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for our company. The opportunity to connect our banking customers with our payments products and services and our payments customers with our banking products and services will continue to drive meaningful profit and return differential for our company over the next several years. Our small business initiative is just 1 example of many that we see driving both account growth and deeper relationships. We believe the suite of products we offer to our small business customers will allow us to grow those relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.\nWe are particularly encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the uptake of our talech point-of-sale functionality, which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple, easy-to-use format that we provide in the form of a dashboard.\nOn the right side of the slide, you can see that the number of new talech customers increased fivefold in 2021 compared to 2020, and that strong growth trajectory has continued in 2022. Year-to-date, new talech customers are 1.5x the full year 2020 level.\nNow let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more details on the quarter.\n\nTerrance R. Dolan\n\nCFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.4% compared with the fourth quarter, driven by 8.0% growth in commercial loans, 2.1% growth in mortgage loans and 1.0% growth in total other retail loans.\nCommercial loan growth reflected slowing paydowns, increased business activity and higher utilization rates across many sectors and most geographies. Client sentiment is stable and commercial lending needs are being driven by inventory building, M&A activity and CapEx expenditures.\nIn the retail portfolio, we saw good growth in residential mortgage and other retail loans, including auto lending. Credit card balances declined linked quarter, reflecting typical seasonality and the impact of certain loans being moved to held for sale in the fourth quarter, which impacted average balance growth.\nTurning to Slide 8. Total average deposits increased 1.0% compared with the fourth quarter despite the typical seasonal reduction in noninterest-bearing deposits. Total average deposits increased 6.5% compared with a year ago.\nSlide 9 shows credit quality trends. Credit quality continues to be strong across our loan portfolio. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.25% at March 31 compared with 0.28% at December 31 and 0.41% a year ago. Our first quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.21% was slightly higher than the fourth quarter level of 0.17%, but lower compared with the first quarter of 2021 level of 0.31%. Our allowance for credit losses as of March 31 totaled $6.1 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans.\nSlide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the first quarter of 2022, we earned $0.99 per diluted share. These results included a relatively small reserve release of $50 million.\nTurning to Slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.2 billion. The 1.6% linked quarter increase reflected strengthening margins and strong loan growth in the quarter, particularly commercial loan growth. Our net interest margin improved 4 basis points to 2.44% due to the changing yield curve, investment portfolio actions and lower cash balances, partially offset by the impact of loan mix.\nSlide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income increased 0.6%, reflecting strong payments services revenue, growth in trust and investment management fees and higher treasury management fees, offset by a lower commercial product revenue and lower mortgage banking revenue. The decline in mortgage banking revenue reflected lower refinancing activity in the market and tighter gain on sale margins giving excess capacity in the industry.\nIn the first quarter, total payments revenues increased 10.1% compared to a year earlier reflecting both continued cyclical post-pandemic recovery as well as strong underlying business trends supported by investments we are making. Credit and debit card revenue increased 0.6% on a year-over-year basis, as the impact of higher credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card revenue, credit and debit card fee revenue would have increased 9.6% compared with the first quarter of 2021.\nBoth corporate payment, products revenue and merchant processing fees increased at a double-digit pace compared with a year ago, with growth driven by both the cyclical recovery of pandemic impacted industries as well as underlying business momentum.\nSlides 13 and 14 provide additional information on our payment services business. In the middle of Slide 13, we provided a table, which illustrates the cyclicality that naturally occurs in each of our 3 payments businesses over the course of a typical year. On the right side of the slide, you can see that COVID-19 impacted industries continued to recover throughout the first quarter.\nAs of the first quarter of 2022, credit and debit card travel volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels. In March of 2022, airline volume was flat compared to March of 2019, the first time we have seen recovery to pre-pandemic levels. Although T&E-related volumes in our corporate payments business are still below pre-pandemic levels, they continue their upward trajectory. In March, corporate T&E volumes in CPS were back to 75% of the pre-pandemic level.\nSlide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our 3 payments businesses. Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are the best indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment. Year-over-year, credit and debit card revenue growth rates continued to be negatively impacted by the decline in prepaid card revenue as the benefit of the government stimulus has dissipated. We provide details on prepaid card fee revenue over the past 5 quarters in the upper right quadrant.\nWhile prepaid card revenue is approaching a run rate on a linked-quarter basis, it will impact year-over-year credit and debit card fee revenue comparisons through the end of 2022. The bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue over the past several quarters, which have partly reflected the pandemic-related recovery.\nWhile we expect the year-over-year growth rates to moderate from current levels, we continue to believe that both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue can grow at a high single-digit pace on a year-over-year basis in a post-pandemic environment.\nTurning to Slide 15. Noninterest expense decreased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis. The decline was driven by lower professional services expense, marketing and business development expense and technology and communication expenses, partially offset by increases in employee benefit expense, primarily due to seasonally higher payroll taxes and other noninterest expenses. Linked quarter expense growth includes the impact of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nSlide 16 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31 was 9.8%. As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we suspended our share buyback program due to the pending acquisition of Union Bank. After closing the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our CET1 ratio reaches 9.0% following the pending deal close.\nI will now provide some forward-looking guidance. The following guidance is for a U.S. Bank on a standalone basis and does not include any potential impact from Union Bank. Let me start with full year guidance. We have updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with market expectations. Given our revised interest rate assumptions, we now expect total net revenue to increase 5% to 6% compared with 2021, reflecting 8% to 11% growth in taxable equivalent, net interest income and stable fee income, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges offsetting growth in other fee businesses. We expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022.\nAs it relates to the second quarter specifically, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 7% on a linked-quarter basis, benefiting from seasonal strength in many of our fee businesses, continued loan growth and the second quarter impact of higher rates on a net interest income and the recapture of fee waivers.\nIn the second quarter, we expect expenses to increase 1% to 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to seasonally higher compensation-related costs and business investment spend. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historic levels, but will continue to normalize over time. For the full year 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%.\nIf you turn to Slide 17, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continue to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal in the first half of 2022, while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal.\nWe expect to close the deal approximately 45 days after being granted U.S. regulatory approval. Conversion is anticipated late in the second half of 2022. We continue to believe this deal is a compelling use of our excess capital from both a strategic and financial perspective. We feel comfortable with our initial financial deal assumptions, including an expectation that it will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%, which is well above our cost of capital.\nAssuming a June 30 close date, we expect Union Bank to contribute approximately $310 million to our pretax pre-provision net revenue in 2022, before considering cost synergies. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $900 million of total cost synergies related to the deal with approximately $85 million to $100 million of cost savings achieved in the second half of 2022. We continue to target total merger and integration costs of $1.2 billion, of which approximately $950 million will be incurred in 2022 with some charges anticipated in the second quarter as we prepare for system integration.\nIn addition, there will be Day 1 -- there will be a Day 1 loss -- loan loss provision required at closing in accordance with the existing CECL accounting rules of approximately $800 million to $900 million.\nI'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Terry. Our strong first quarter results have us well for the rest of the year, and we are encouraged by the loan growth trends and business activity that we are seeing in the early part of the second quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Nonetheless, we continue to approach credit decisions with a through-the-cycle lens. .\nWe feel good about the secular trends we are seeing across our fee businesses. Our payments revenue continues to recover, and we look to continued cyclical recovery in travel and entertainment as the year progresses. More importantly, over the near and intermediate term, our multiyear investments in this business and the strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging the power of our payments ecosystem will continue to pay off. We are closely managing operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives, our payments capabilities and our technology modernization.\nOn that front, I'd like to highlight a few of our recent announcements. We enhanced the service that we call Xtend Pay, an offering which allows our existing consumer and business cardholders to buy now, pay later option where they can choose a flexible payment plan that suits their needs. We also rolled out a request for payment capability, which allows merchants to send bills directly to customers' bank's accounts. Those customers have the option to send payment immediately to the biller via real-time payment rails.\nIn February, we announced a meaningful investment in our cloud strategy, which is aimed at modernizing our technology foundation so as to further improve the security of our data, financial assets and customer privacy while allowing for the transformation of applications and infrastructure to create leading-edge customer experiences. We will continue to lead our products, services and capabilities to enhance the customer experience, which we believe will support meaningful account growth and deeper relationships across our entire franchise over the next several years.\nIn closing, 2022 is off to a good start, and I'd like to thank our employees for all they do to support our strategic goals and continue our customer -- continue to serve our customers and communities. We will now open up the call for Q&A.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at 11:00 a.m. Central Time through Wednesday, January 26, 2022 at 10:59 p.m. Central Time.\nI will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp.\n\nJennifer Ann Thompson\n\nExecutive VP and Director of IR & Economic Analysis, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThank you, Natalia, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.\nI would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.\nI'll now turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have.\nI'll begin on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.07 and generated total revenue of $5.7 billion. We saw a strong balance sheet growth this quarter, including deposit growth of over $18 billion or 4.3% compared with the third quarter. Average loans grew by 2% linked quarter or 2.7% excluding the impact of loan forgiveness related to PPP. We are encouraged by the loan growth momentum, and we have a positive outlook for 2022 given improving client sentiment and business conditions and continued strength in certain focused commercial portfolios, such as ABS lending and supply chain financing.\nThe significant increase in liquidity provided by the strong deposit inflows this quarter puts us in a favorable position to support future balance sheet growth. Deposit growth provided the opportunity for tactical investment and cash management strategies that pressured the net interest margin for the fourth quarter but was both accretive to net interest income and maintained asset sensitivity for our rising rate environment.\nTurning to fees. Underlying client acquisition and market share trends across our business lines were healthy and payment sales trends continue to improve on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, we released $145 million of loan loss reserves reflecting continued strong credit quality, including a record low net charge-off ratio.\nIn the lower right quadrant, you can see that our book value per share totaled $32.71 at December 31, which was 1.5% higher than September 30. Our CET1 capital ratio was 10% at December 31.\nSlide 4 provides key performance metrics. Slide 5 highlights strengths in digital engagement. Digital transactions now account for over 80% of total transactions and digital loan sales account for 2/3 of total loan sales.\nTurning to Slide 6. We continue to believe our initiatives aimed at connecting our banking customers with our payment products and our services, and our payments customers with our banking products and services will allow us to grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.\nNow let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter.\n\nTerrance R. Dolan\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Andy.\nIf you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 2.0% compared to the third quarter driven by a 2.6% increase in commercial loans which benefited from new business activity and improved utilization rates. Retail loan growth was driven primarily by higher credit card balances, growth in residential mortgages and strong production of installment loans, including auto lending. At December 31, PPP loan balances totaled $1.4 billion compared to $2.4 billion at September 30. Excluding PPP loans, fourth quarter average loans grew by 2.7% on a linked-quarter basis.\nTurning to Slide 8. Total average deposits increased by $18.4 billion or 4.3% compared with the third quarter. We continue to see a favorable mix shift with an average -- with average noninterest-bearing deposits increasing by 5.4% and average savings deposits increasing by 4.4%, while higher cost time deposits declined by 3.0%.\nSlide 9 shows credit quality trends. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.28% at December 31, compared with 0.32% at September 30 and 0.44% a year ago. Our fourth quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.17% improved on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Borrower liquidity and stronger asset valuations continued to support repayment and recovery of problem loans. Our reserve release was $145 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics. Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30 -- 31 totaled $6.2 billion or 1.97% of loans.\nSlide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we earned $1.07 per diluted share. These results included a reserve release of $145 million.\nTurning to Slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion came in a little higher than our expectations. The $47 million decrease compared with the third quarter was driven by an $82 million decline in PPP interest and fees, partially offset by earning asset growth. Our net interest margin declined by 13 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 2.40%. The net interest margin decline was related to a 6 basis point impact from lower PPP loan interest and fees and a 6 basis point impact from elevated liquidity and related investment portfolio and cash management strategies aimed at optimizing our asset sensitivity going into 2022.\nSlide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income declined by 0.6% as compared -- as strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and commercial product revenue was more than offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue, reflecting the interest rate environment and lower securities gains and other fee revenue. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income declined by 5.9%, primarily reflecting seasonally lower payments and capital markets revenues and declining mortgage banking revenue as expected.\nSlide 13 provides information on our Payment Services businesses. Sales volumes in each of our 3 businesses expect -- exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter despite some Omicron-related softness in late December. We expect year-over-year payments momentum to continue into 2022 as lagging sectors such as airline hospitality and corporate T&E benefit from a continued cyclical recovery toward pre-pandemic levels and as our multiyear investments in e-commerce and tech-led drive secular growth improvements.\nAs we saw in our earnings press release this morning, effective January 3, U.S. Bank has eliminated fees for certain nonsufficient funds. We believe this is not only the right thing to do for customers, but it is a smart business decision. For some time, we have been at the forefront of using digital technology to help our customers avoid overdraft charges and our efforts have helped our customers more easily and effectively manage their money, which has contributed to increased customer satisfaction. This latest move is simply the next step in the process.\nTurning to Slide 14. Noninterest expense increased by $104 million or 3.0% compared with the third quarter. This increase was driven by higher medical claims within employee benefit expense and higher professional services expenses, higher marketing and business development costs. Tax credit amortization expense was also higher in the fourth quarter in line with typical seasonal trends.\nSlide 15 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at December 31 was 10.0%, which decreased slightly compared with September 30 driven by risk-weighted asset growth and the impact of acquisitions completed near the end of the quarter. As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire Union Bank. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second half of 2022. After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%.\nI will now provide some forward-looking guidance. We expect both net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis as well as our net interest margin to be relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis, with growth expected in subsequent quarters. With our base case -- under our base case scenario, which incorporates 3 rate hikes, we expect full year 2022 net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis to increase at a mid-single-digit pace.\nWe expect mortgage revenue to be slightly lower in the first quarter on a linked-quarter basis, in line with slower refinancing activity in the market. Payments revenue is seasonally lower in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we expect total revenue to increase at a high single-digit pace driven by double-digit growth in both merchant processing revenue and corporate payments revenue. We expect credit card revenue to be stable on a year-over-year basis as high single-digit growth in credit and debit card fees is offset by lower prepaid processing fees. Excluding the prepaid headwind, which will abate after the first quarter, we expect total payment revenue to increase at a low-teen rate on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.\nWe expect other revenue to approximate $125 million to $150 million per quarter over the course of 2022. We expect expenses to be relatively stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical levels but will normalize over time as the effects of the pandemic continue to subside. For the full year 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 21.0%.\nI will hand it back to Andy for closing comments.\n\nAndrew J. Cecere\n\nChairman, President & CEO, U.S. Bancorp\n\nThanks, Terry.\nFourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we are starting off the year with momentum building across our lending and fee businesses. We feel good about the trajectory of loan growth and are well positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment. We expect client acquisition growth and account penetration to drive market share gains across our fee businesses.\nIn particular, we believe 2022 will be another good year for our Payments business. Due to the Omicron surge, year-over-year sales growth has slowed somewhat in the past few weeks from the exceptionally strong pace we saw in the second half of 2021. However, growth rates remain strong, and we believe this will likely prove to be a speed bump rather than an extended slowdown. Nonetheless, the situation is fluid, and we'll continue to monitor trends closely and update you along the way.\nOur investments in technology to support our digital transformation and payments ecosystem initiatives are paying off, and we continue to look for uses of capital that will drive higher returns. In the fourth quarter, we acquired TravelBank, a fintech that provides tech-driven expense and travel management solutions to help businesses manage their operations more efficiently. Also in the fourth quarter, we closed on the acquisition of PFM Asset Management, which not only increased our assets under management, but has enhanced our position in a niche area within the money market world.\nWe are looking forward to closing our previously announced acquisition of Union Bank later this year. The addition of Union Bank will increase our scale, improve our market share in a demographically attractive market and add over 1 million consumer clients and over 190,000 business banking customers to whom we can offer our leading digital capabilities and our expansive product set. The strategic and financial benefits of this combination will accrue to shareholders over many years.\nBut the numbers only tell part of the U.S. Bank story. As we start the new year, I want to emphasize that how we do things will continue to be as important as what we do. And so in closing, I'd like to thank our employees who come in every day with the goal of doing the right thing for our customers, our communities, their fellow employees and are our constituents. Thank you for helping to make 2021 a successful year and position us well for the future.\nWe will now open up the call to Q&A.",

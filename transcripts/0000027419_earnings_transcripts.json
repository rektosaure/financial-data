Welcome to the Target Corporation Q3 Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. At the close of prepared remarks, we will open the queue for the Q&A session. At that time, if you have a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, 19 November 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q3 2025 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Fiddelke, Chief Operating Officer, Rick Gomez, Chief Commercial Officer, and Jim Lee, Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Brian, Michael, Rick, and Jim will provide their insights on our Q3 performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast.\nFollowing the call, Jim and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. Finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to kick things off. Brian?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This is my final earnings call as Target CEO. I plan to keep my comments brief this morning, but I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for your ongoing engagement and support over the last 11 years. It's been the highlight of my career to lead this great company, and our business has undergone many important changes since I arrived in 2014. We entered into an innovative partnership with CVS to run our pharmacy business. We changed our operating model in food and beverage, paving the way for explosive growth in that part of the business.\nWe invested in our product design, development, and sourcing capabilities, and launched several new billion-dollar-owned brands. We pioneered the stores-as-hubs model for digital fulfillment, remodeled well over 1,000 of our existing stores, and added nearly 200 net new locations in the US. All told, this year's top line is expected to be well over $30 billion higher than the year I arrived. In that 2014 fiscal year, GAAP and adjusted EPS both came in around $4 a share, and the upper end of this year's expected range for adjusted EPS is double that number.\nI am proud that our team could deliver this top and bottom line growth while building a solid foundation of operating capabilities, including one of the nation's largest loyalty programs in Target Circle, and a rapidly growing retail media business in Roundel. That said, our business has not been performing up to its potential over the last few years, and I am singularly focused on supporting Michael and the entire leadership team as they make changes to the way we work, enhancing our merchandising authority, our retail experience, and investing in technology to accelerate our business.\nIn the call today, you'll hear how the team is working quickly to get the company back to profitable growth. While we're not there yet, I'm confident we're on the right path, and Michael is the right person to lead the next chapter of Target's growth. I want to thank all of you for your participation today and for your thoughtful engagement over the years. Finally, I want to thank the entire Target team. It has been a privilege to work with you in support of this great brand. Now, I'll turn the call and today's Q&A over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We have high but achievable aspirations for Target's future, and we're acting with urgency to make the changes and investments to position Target for sustainable and profitable growth over time. While our Q3 performance came in as expected, we're far from satisfied with our current results, and we won't be satisfied until we're operating at our full potential. To get there, we've set three distinct but highly interrelated priorities for our team.\nFirst, we must solidify our design-led merchandising authority, leading with incredible product in a way that is distinctly Target. Second, as a retailer that believes that the shopping experience is every bit as important as the products we sell, we need to offer a more consistently elevated experience across our stores and digital platforms. Third, we need to more fully use technology to improve our speed, guest experience, and efficiency throughout the business. Together, these priorities are in service of one goal: getting back to sustainable growth as quickly as possible.\nThey guide every decision we make, and I want to spend a few minutes to help clarify what these priorities are, why each matters, and share some of our progress to date. Before I expand on these priorities, I want to pause and acknowledge our recent restructuring at headquarters, in which we eliminated approximately 1,800 roles, or about 8% of our headquarters' footprint, a difficult but necessary step forward. While Jim will walk through some financial aspects of this decision, I want to make it clear that this move wasn't about cutting costs.\nInstead, by removing layers that have added complexity to the way we work, we're aiming to work with greater agility, making it clear who owns decisions, and empowering our team to operate with greater authority and speed in support of our strategy. Let's discuss how we're making progress in solidifying our merchandising authority and elevating our shopping experience. You'll also see the critical role that enhanced technology is playing in support of both, helping us progress quickly, efficiently, and in industry-leading ways.\nWe are a design-led company, and that starts with our authority in merchandising, our ability to build a unique assortment of the right, stylish, on-trend products at incredible value, that's so central to who we are, and key to our differentiation and future growth. At Target, we believe that offering an assortment that's distinctly ours is essential to maintaining our merchandising authority with our guests. Not every category plays the same role towards these efforts, but together they create an assortment and experience that feels unmistakably Target.\nA great example is the transformation of our hardlines business into Fun 101, an evolution in bringing greater cultural relevance, style authority, and trend-right energy to the assortment, reinforcing what makes shopping at Target so special. While we have much more change in Fun 101 to come, it builds our confidence to see the categories that have seen the greatest change driving some of the strongest sales performance already. Rick will have more details to share later.\nWithin each category, merchandising authority means staying incredibly close to our guests by knowing what they'll want next, reacting to, predicting, and even setting new trends , and tech will play a critical role in helping us get there. We're enhancing our capabilities by equipping our teams with new tools that provide them with AI-enabled consumer insights at their fingertips.\nOur merchants now have real-time access to advanced data, from what is currently trending on social media, to which products and styles are resonating with consumers at Target and across the industry today, to what future trends our guests are most likely to care about, helping our team forecast needs, anticipate trends, and buy both smarter and faster. New tools also include our recently developed Target Trend Brain, our new internal creative platform, which uses GenAI technology to help our teams identify and react to emerging trends faster, and predict future trends.\nBy leveraging AI to capture color, material, style, and product details, and applying consumer research and our brand principles, we can deliver unique and on-trend products to our guests faster than ever before. To further enhance our speed to market, we've also created synthetic audiences, AI-driven models that simulate real consumer populations to preview how different groups could respond to campaigns and products before they ever launch. This allows our marketing and design teams to test, learn, and refine products, promotions, and messaging with incredible speed and efficiency.\nWhile you'll see us continue to accelerate our use of technology, it's our talented team that brings this work to life. We are investing intentionally in our team and how we approach our work. We're redefining roles throughout the cross-functional team that supports our assortment planning and buying decisions, what we call our merchant roundtable, to better equip our teams to make bolder decisions even faster. I'm also excited to share we've welcomed new leaders to the team in areas like our home business to bring new ways of thinking and accelerate change in this signature category.\nThese steps forward are examples of how we're solidifying our design-led merchandising authority by using people, process, and technology to drive greater levels of newness and differentiation across our entire assortment, more quickly reacting to emerging trends, and amplifying these trends faster than ever before. Let's turn now to our team's efforts to elevate the guest shopping experience, both in stores and digital. A great guest experience means a lot of things, but it starts with a warm, friendly, and helpful team. In stores, we're making changes to give our team members more time to focus on what matters most: spending time helping our guests.\nThrough enhanced digital tools, we're reducing time devoted to backroom tasks through more efficient truck unloading and stocking. Every hour we save is being reinvested to allow more guest interaction, with a focus on friendliness and service that makes Target Target. An elevated shopping experience also means consistently finding the products you want and need every time you shop. This holiday season, we're using our expertise and deep consumer knowledge in a new GenAI-powered gift finder available on our website and our app, allowing guests to ask questions in the app and help them find the perfect gift this holiday season.\nBy simply asking something as generic as, what is a good present for my mother-in-law, to something more specific, like, I have a five-year-old son that loves dinosaurs, what gifts are available for under $20? Our app will provide recommendations or ask clarifying questions to quickly and easily help guests find the right present for every person on their holiday shopping list. For guests shopping in our stores and online, we're also investing resources to ensure we have the right product in the right place at the right time all year long.\nThis includes modernizing the technology that forecasts, orders, and positions our inventory, using machine learning to optimize flow from supplier to shelf. It's helping us move inventory more efficiently, improve reliability for everyday, frequently purchased items, and further improve in stocks. We've coupled these tech enhancements with process improvements, some great root cause problem-solving by the team, and clearer measurements that show where we have the most room to improve. All in, we've seen meaningful progress on this front.\nIn fact, this past quarter, the on-shelf availability of our 5,000 top items, the ones for which being in stock is most important to our guests, and which represent 30% of our total unit sales, saw a more than 150 basis point improvement compared to this time last year. Even with this meaningful progress, I want to emphasize that we have much more room to improve, and we're not slowing down. An elevated store experience also means meeting our guests when, where, and how they want to shop.\nTo do this, we're reconfiguring the role each of our stores plays within a market to optimize fulfillment, speed, and capabilities, and in the process, also better supporting the in-store shopping experience. Our pilot in the Chicago market has demonstrated the effectiveness of new operating models that govern each location's mix of in-store and digital fulfillment, helping to improve the guest experience and operational performance at each store at the same time. For those stores with high foot traffic volume, we're reducing their mix of brown box fulfillment, allowing those teams to spend more time interacting with in-store guests.\nFor lower volume stores in the same market with big back rooms that are perfectly suited to ship product, we're pushing more digital fulfillment volume their way. Of course, more labor hours to support this work, creating economies of scale and a more optimized workload for each node within a market. With the changes we've made, we're getting guests the products they want faster than ever while reducing average fulfillment costs. As a reminder, we already reach around 80% of the US population with same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360, where sales grew more than 35% again this past quarter.\nAround 99% of the US population is already eligible for two-day shipping. Now, with our evolving market fulfillment strategy that includes expanding these learnings to an additional 35 markets, more than half of the US is eligible for next-day shipping, and we expect to meaningfully expand that reach in the coming year. Elevating experience also means staying ahead of new ways our guests want to shop. We're leading in the next wave of digital engagement by partnering with the world's biggest GenAI platforms through an initiative we call conversational curation.\nBuilding on the Apps for ChatGPT experience previewed in early October, we're curating the shopping experience directly from the guests' own conversation. Guests tell us what they want, or even what they're trying to solve for, and OpenAI will offer personalized recommendations. Through this partnership, we expect to be one of the first retailers on OpenAI platforms to offer the purchase of multiple items in a single transaction, offer fresh food products on the platform, and the ability to choose drive-up and pickup fulfillment options, in addition to the conventional shipping options offered by others.\nFinally, I'd like to touch on important investments that will drive both merchandising authority and an elevated experience. Our investments in new stores, store remodels, and chain-wide category changes aimed at providing greater inspiration and joy for our guests every time they shop. Our new, larger-format stores are outpacing our initial sales expectations and continue to be a strong source of growth. Given current real estate opportunities, we expect to continue opening these bigger boxes in more and more markets across the US.\nAdditionally, we're formulating plans for next year that will bring greater changes to key floor pads throughout the store, which will accelerate both our merchandising authority and our experience. To support this change, we'll be increasing our CapEx plans for next fiscal year, spending about $5 billion, about $1 billion more than this year, to bring the latest and greatest of Target to new and existing markets. Rick and Jim will have more to share on this in a moment. Now, before I get ready to pass things over to Rick, I want to thank the Target team. You power our progress, and it is together as a team that we'll write Target's next chapter.\nWhile we're not yet where we want to be, we're making change to lay the foundation for a stronger, faster, and more innovative Target, one that's grounded in our purpose, fueled by our team, and focused on growth. I'm proud of the progress we've made, and confident in the opportunities ahead. To those of you listening this morning, if you leave having heard nothing else, I'd leave you with the following thoughts. We are not satisfied with our current results and are relentless in our pursuit of returning to growth.\nOur three priorities around merchandising, experience, and technology have us on the right path, and we know what needs to be done and are actively making progress towards being the best version of ourselves for our guests, our team, and our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick to share more about our Q3 performance and all we have planned for this holiday season.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nThanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Our Q3 results underscore that we still have work to do, but they also show us that the actions we're taking are the right ones for our guests and for our business. We're focused on improving performance, particularly in discretionary categories, listening closely to our guests, and moving with greater agility to bring them the newness and affordability they expect from Target. In Q3, results were in line with expectations and similar to Q2 performance, with the exception of Q2 benefiting from the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. Q3 comp sales were down 2.7%, reflecting continued softness in discretionary categories like home and apparel.\nPartially offset by growth in food and beverage, and Fun 101, digital comparable sales grew 2.4%, fueled by more than 35% growth in same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360, and continued growth in drive-up. We saw the strongest sales around seasonal moments like back to school, back to college, and Halloween, highlighting once again the importance of these holidays to our business. Across categories, one theme is clear: our guests continue to respond to newness and style-forward assortments.\nFun 101 delivered another quarter of growth, led by a nearly 10% comp in toys and double-digit growth in music, video games, and our expanded selection of sporting equipment, all categories where we've invested in unique to Target assortments that are clearly resonating. Food and beverage also delivered another quarter of comp growth, with notable strength in beverages, which were up nearly 7% in Q3, as guests leaned into our trend-forward health and wellness assortment. From prebiotic sodas to better-for-you energy drinks, we also saw strength in candy categories, particularly as the Halloween holiday approached.\nWhile apparel comps were down 5%, we delivered meaningful growth in denim and sleepwear categories, driven by style-forward newness that helped to offset softness across the portfolio. This tells us that while there is still plenty of work to do, where we have made our biggest bets in terms of on-trend, design-led newness, consumers are reacting positively, giving us confidence in our approach and the path ahead. Turning to the consumer, many of the themes remain largely consistent with what we shared in prior quarters. Guests are choiceful, stretching budgets, and prioritizing value.\nThey're spending where it matters most, especially in food, essentials, and beauty, while looking for trend-right deals in discretionary categories. They want quality and price to coexist, something we do particularly well through our balance of must-have national brands, our exclusive owned brand portfolio, and our curation of emerging brands. As part of our work to solidify our merchandising authority, we will continue to elevate our assortment to lead with trend while always considering affordability and value.\nAs we approach the holidays, we know consumers remain cautious. Sentiment is at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability, and tariffs. Yet they remain emotionally motivated. They want to celebrate with loved ones without overspending. Our job is to help them do just that. Given our focus on affordability, we recently lowered prices on thousands of everyday food and essential items to help families further manage their budgets.\nFor the next major holiday around the corner, our Thanksgiving meal deal this year is one of our most affordable yet, feeding a family of four for less than $20, with Good & Gather turkey at just $0.79 per pound, as well as potatoes, stuffing, and other seasonal sides for less than $5. While we are, of course, standing tall for the traditional Thanksgiving fare, guests are also embracing new food trends like Good & Gather seasonal empanadas, gourmet host gifts from Marks and Spencer, Stonewall Kitchen, Sugarfina, and Heart & Hand with Magnolia table, and new-to-Target brands like Little Spoon, Everyday Dose, and Protein Pop.\nAs a percentage of our total food and beverage sales, we are selling twice the volume of new products compared to the industry, a sign that our trend bets are paying off. We're also accelerating newness in women's apparel, leaning into luxe fabrics and trending athleisure at affordable prices. Inspired by our sourcing trip to the Swiss Alps, our latest cashmere-like sweaters start at just $30 and deliver the on-trend, casual yet chic après-ski look. For athleisure fans, JoyLab is launching new patterns and fabrications in mid-December, earlier than ever this year, perfect for gifting or those New Year fitness goals.\nIn holiday decor, we're offering upscale and festive design at unbeatable prices. From contemporary collections to nostalgic Christmas classics, we have styles for every home. Ornaments start at $1, $3, and $5 price points, with holiday throws at $10, and wreaths and faux greenery at $12, bringing incredible design and quality within reach. Once the tree is trimmed, it's time to think about what goes under it. As I've shared before, trading cards have been a huge trend that we have been leaning into, and this holiday season, we will be offering new product drops nearly every week, including Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, NFL, MLB, and WNBA cards.\nThis includes highly anticipated exclusives already hitting shelves and continuing to be released throughout December as well. This year, we've also expanded our assortment of affordable and on-trend toys, including thousands under $20, with many starting at just $5. As the number one market share player for Lego, we are partnering with this iconic brand to offer exclusive-to-Target sets starting at just $10. For Barbie fans of all ages, we're offering two exclusive Barbie collaborations with Joanna Gaines, a collectible doll and her perfectly designed townhouse to live in.\nAll in, we are introducing 20,000 new items into this year's holiday assortment, twice as many as last year, with over half exclusive to Target. Before turning it over to Jim, I want to share how Michael's new enterprise priorities are taking shape across our commercial organization. In partnership with the Enterprise Acceleration Office, we've been modernizing how our cross-functional teams support all buying decisions at Target, what we refer to as our merchant roundtable. To clarify roles, streamline accountability, and empower teams to make bold, data-driven decisions, allowing us to move faster and infuse newness into assortments more frequently.\nNot all newness is created equal. It isn't just about offering new products for the sake of newness. It's about leaning into the emerging trends and culturally relevant moments. When we do, this is when we see the strongest reaction from our guests. For the perfect example, look no further than our Stranger Things 5 assortment. We have the largest assortment of exclusive products in retail in the US, along with throwback marketing campaigns that transport guests back to the 1980s nostalgia. Plus, we're dropping new items into the assortment every week to align with the new episode releases.\nThis is yet another example of the incredible work we are doing to reimagine our hardlines assortment into Fun 101, a year-round celebration of culture, trend, and style, served up in an only-at-Target way. Next year, we're planning to take these learnings and make bold investments to transform the in-store shopping experience and assortment. In fact, we already have plans to introduce more changes to our stores than we have in any year in the past decade. We will have far more details to share at our financial community meeting this spring. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim to walk through our Q3 financial results and updated expectations for the balance of the year.\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target\n\nThanks, Rick. Our financial results in Q3 were in line with our expectations as our team continues to focus on what we can control and manage the business with discipline despite continued softness on the top line, volatility in weekly and monthly trends, and uncertainty in the external environment. Q3 net sales were 1.5% lower than a year ago, slightly better than our year-to-date performance, but about 60 basis points softer than in Q2.\nCategory sales trends were relatively consistent between Q2 and Q3, with the exception of hardlines, where we saw continued growth but at a slower pace following an outsized boost from the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the second quarter. Across our selling channels, comp sales in our stores were down about 4%, while comparable digital sales grew 2.4% on top of nearly 11% a year ago. Within our first-party digital sales, we saw mid-single-digit growth in our same-day services, led by more than 35% growth in same-day delivery.\nBeyond our first-party digital platform, we saw a significant step-up to nearly 50% growth in GMV of our Target Plus marketplace, and mid-teens growth in Roundel ad sales, demonstrating the breadth and growing relevance of our digital ecosystem. Top-line results during the quarter were quite volatile, with net sales close to flat in August and October, and down about 4% in September. This pattern reinforces many of the consumer themes we've been highlighting for some time, as guests shopped around back to school and back to college in August, and around Halloween in October, but pulled back in September in between those key seasons.\nIn addition, September apparel sales were hampered by unusually warm weather across the country, while October benefited from the response to our most recent Target Circle week, as consumers continued to focus on value. On the gross margin line, our Q3 rate of 28.2% was about 10 basis points lower than last year. Among the drivers, we saw about a percentage point of pressure in merchandising, reflecting the impact of higher markdowns. This pressure was offset by about 70 basis points of favorability from lower inventory shrink versus last year.\nIn addition, we saw about 20 basis points of favorability from supply chain and digital fulfillment, as the benefit of higher productivity and the lapping of last year's supply chain challenges was partially offset by the deleveraging impact of lower sales. Regarding our outlook for inventory shrink, consistent with our prior commentary, we expect that shrink improvements will account for approximately 80 to 90 basis points of gross margin rate favorability for the full year. This would bring it fully back down to pre-pandemic levels, marking a dramatic turnaround over the last two years.\nOne other note: our Q3 ending inventory was about 2% lower than a year ago. This is in line with recent trends in our Q4 sales outlook, and reflects growth in our frequency businesses that was more than offset by lower levels in our discretionary businesses. Moving back to our Q3 P&L, our SG&A expense rate of 21.9% was about 60 basis points higher than a year ago. However, this rate reflected about 60 basis points of impact from one-time business transformation costs. Excluding these costs, our Q3 SG&A expense rate was approximately flat to last year.\nOn the bottom line, our business delivered Q3 GAAP EPS of $1.51 compared with $1.85 a year ago. Adjusted EPS, which excluded business transformation costs, was $1.78 in the Q3, about 4% lower than a year ago. While this is far short of where we aspire to be over time, it is solid profit performance in a quarter where our top line was down more than 1% and reflects stronger relative performance versus the first half of the year, consistent with our prior commentary.\nI'll turn now to capital deployment and reiterate our priorities, which we've consistently followed for decades. First, we look to fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. We look to deploy any excess cash beyond those first two uses to repurchase shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. Regarding our first priority, we've invested about $2.8 billion in capital expenditures so far this year and continue to expect full-year CapEx of around $4 billion.\nRegarding the second priority, we paid $518 million in dividends in Q3, which was $2 million higher than last year, as a 1.8% increase in the per-share dividend was mostly offset by a lower average share count. Regarding the last priority, we deployed just over $150 million to repurchase our shares in the Q3 following a pause in Q2. While we ended the quarter with a healthy cash position and expect to have continued capacity within the limits of our middle A ratings, we'll continue to exercise caution in our repurchase program in the face of continued uncertainty in the external environment. Now I want to turn to our outlook for the Q4 and the full year.\nWhile our Q3 results were consistent with our expectations, we've continued to see a high degree of volatility in our business. In addition, we're mindful of the challenges facing consumers, as exemplified by recent declines in consumer confidence. As such, while our top-line expectations for Q4 are in line with our prior guidance and recent performance, we've narrowed our full-year EPS ranges and moved our adjusted EPS range to the bottom half of the prior range. With that as context on the top line for the Q4, we're continuing to expect a low single-digit decline in our comparable sales, in line with our year-to-date performance.\nOn the adjusted EPS line, our updated range is from $7 to 8 for the full year. The expected range for GAAP EPS is about $0.70 higher than for adjusted EPS, reflecting the benefit of the first-quarter litigation settlement, partially offset by business transformation costs. Against the backdrop of a very difficult environment, I am proud of the team's hard work this year to navigate a very high level of complexity, including their work to mitigate the impact of tariffs and navigate challenging consumer conditions. Over the past several months, we've also been hard at work to drive prioritization and outline key investments to return Target back to sustainable growth.\nLooking ahead to next year, we expect to ramp up our capital spending meaningfully in support of our store experience and remodel program, a step-up in technology, digital fulfillment capabilities, and investment in new stores. Our current plan envisions 2026 CapEx dollars increasing by approximately 25%, or $1 billion versus 2025. In addition, we are planning to leverage a continuous pipeline of productivity initiatives, and approximately $180 million of expected annualized savings from our recent business transformation efforts, to invest in key areas in support of our three strategic priorities.\nWe will share more details on our plans for 2026 and beyond at our financial community meeting in March. While we know there's much more work to do, I'm confident that we are rapidly moving in the right direction and positioning our business to get back to sustainable, profitable growth in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nThanks, Jim. Before Rick, Jim, and I take your questions, I want to emphasize some of what you've heard from us today, and to underscore where we're headed as a team. There is no question that this is a period of transformation for Target. The environment around us continues to evolve, whether it's shifting consumer demand, changing competitor dynamics, or broader macroeconomic pressures. Let me be clear: we are not waiting for conditions to improve. We are driving the change ourselves right now.\nWe are taking bold, decisive steps to reshape how we work and reignite growth with urgency, focus, and confidence in who we are and who we can be. We know what makes Target special: an unmatched merchandising authority, and the ability to create joy through an elevated and inspiring guest experience, all enabled by the power of technology to amplify both speed and connection across every part of our business. These are more than ideas on a page. They are the pillars of our strategy, shaping every decision we make, and they are coming to life right now across the company. We're hard at work to simplify how we work to make faster, smarter decisions.\nWe're laser-focused on strengthening our foundation in our supply chain, our stores, our digital experience, and our technology capabilities. We're relentlessly striving toward greater authority in merchandising by combining data-driven insight with a design leadership and creative spark that makes Target Target. Together, these actions are paving the way for what comes next: a return to sustainable, profitable growth. While many out there have questions about where we'll go next, we are confident we're on the right path.\nThat's because we're building from a strong foundation, a brand that guests love, a culture that's resilient, and a team that's united behind a shared mission to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. As we look ahead, we're not just talking about getting back to growth. We're talking about building a stronger, more innovative Target that's ready to lead in the next era of retail, one that moves faster, connects deeper, and stands taller in the hearts and minds of our guests.\nTo our investors, partners, and the financial community, thank you for your continued engagement. If you're frustrated with our recent performance, we are too, and our entire team is working incredibly hard to return to growth and live up to our full potential. Finally, in the spirit of thinking and working differently, I'm excited to share that this year's financial community meeting will take place right here in Minneapolis on 3 March 2025. It will be a peek behind the curtain to help bring to life what we've talked about today in a more tangible way, providing a firsthand look at how we're evolving our assortment and technology, all in service of returning to growth.\nWe look forward to seeing you all in Minneapolis this spring, and we'll be sending out more information very soon. Now we'll move to Q&A. Rick, Jim, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star one. To withdraw your question, please press star two. Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. Brian, best of luck. My question, Michael, for you: I think in 2016 or 2017, there was a reset of margin during a prior investment phase that helped reposition Target for the next several years. At this stage, I guess, can we rule that out? How have you thought about taking maybe a deeper investment in, I guess, margin in order to reinvest, or should we now assume that this is the plan, it goes forward, and there does not need to be one? Thanks.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Simeon. We have got a pretty big Q4 holiday season that we will get through before we unpack the specifics for next year. What I can tell you is we are committed to making the right investments to get the outcomes we want when it comes to leading with merchandising authority and elevating the experience.\nWe also have a lot from which to draw on there. The team's doing a wonderful job of finding efficiency within the business and changing some of how we work to reinvest. I mean, an example of that is some of what we found in elevating the store experience. We've taken a lot from our fulfillment market tests in Chicago. As a reminder, that's about changing kind of how we organize stores against the work to be done.\nWe've found that making some stores brown box shipping specialists because they've got the capacity, they've got the big back room, they might be a little lower volume in general, let them ship that brown box product so that we can free up our busiest in-store guest experiences to focus on serving that in-store guest. Changes like that, we've seen good results in. We're rolling out some of the learnings from that test to 35 more markets here before the year is out. That's the type of change we believe can fuel the step-up in experience that we want.\nWe're excited about doing the work to get better outcomes when it comes to leading with merchandising authority and elevating the guest experience. We feel like we're on the right path. The other thing I might add is you heard us describe our capital investments for next year. That's putting capital to work in direct support to the priorities that we've laid out. Like we always have, we invest capital where we see strong return. We're excited to make the investments in technology, supply chain, but especially store experience next year. More remodels, a strong new store pipeline, more change to the broader store.\nSo I think that's an example of us seeing the opportunity to invest to get growth and leaning into it.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThe quick follow-up, and you partially addressed it, I wanted to ask about the gaps and capabilities. You mentioned the different focuses, merchandising experience. What are the most urgent gaps and capabilities, and then what are you most excited about, meaning things that can get addressed in the near term?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah, the things that I'm most excited about are some of the places where we're seeing momentum already. Take, for example, the work that we're doing in Fun 101. That's a perfect representation of us bringing real focus strategy to the categories that we used to call hardlines to say, what categories are what we do, are the things that we do uniquely well, best positioned? How do we bring style, culture, and design leadership to those categories? We've made more change in those categories, and we see response in those categories. It's good to see categories like toys running an almost 10% increase in Q3.\nIt's good to see the places where we've applied focus moving in the right direction. I think the same is true on experience. The work we're doing to create a consistently elevated experience, we like the trajectory there. That starts with the basics, being in stock as part of a great guest experience, and we're seeing real, meaningful progress from the team's incredible work to move the needle in the right direction there. While on that front, we're not yet satisfied, we're not yet where we want to be, we like the direction of travel a lot. We'll continue to do the work and apply the focus to get improvement in the direction that we want there.\nRick, I don't know if you'd want to add anything on the product side for some of the places where we've got change and where we're seeing a strong guest response.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nYeah, I mean, I can—well, how about this? I'll talk a little bit about some of the capabilities that were addressed, about which capabilities do we want to—are a priority for us to evolve. I want to highlight merchant roundtable evolution because it is so important to having those right products that are going to deliver the growth. It is a cross-functional team that we've had in place.\nIf you think about the decisions that we made a couple of weeks ago to reduce the footprint in HQ, a big part of that was around simplifying the organization so we could make decisions faster. The next step in that is to outline how we're going to work differently, clarify roles and responsibilities, clarify decision-making. That's the work the team is doing now. What I'm really excited about is then adding in the automation and the technology so the team can spend less time doing the analysis and spend more time being creative, coming up with those new ideas that are going to meet consumer needs and fuel growth like what we're doing in Fun 101.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nTo build on Rick's last point there, I think the role that technology plays—the technology will play—is going to be incredibly important across the enterprise, but a huge shout-out specifically to the pace at which Prat and team are moving. I like the acceleration of the path forward in technology. I think you can see that in some of the AI examples that we shared today, but you can also see that in some of the core foundation basics that we know we have work to do to make sure our teams have all the tools at their fingertips to build the right assortment, segment that assortment, use technology more powerfully to automate how product moves through our supply chain.\nThat continues to be a key area of focus for us, but the urgency with which we're moving that work along gives me a lot of confidence.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks. Have a great holiday.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the level of investment that you're stepping up in the business in terms of the $5 billion for next year in CapEx. How do you think about the key levels or the key areas in which you will be investing? How do you think about whether or not that's the right level or if more may be needed to improve results to a greater magnitude across the business?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah, great question, Corey. I think about it in two ways. This is a conversation that Jim and I have regularly with input across the team, obviously. It's two things. One is it starts with a focus strategy. Investments need to follow the path that we think drives the most growth for Target, that starts with clarity on the strategy. The second is we chase returns. The places where we're excited to step up investment are places where we expect really strong returns. That starts with investments in our stores, and those come in a couple of forms. You've heard us talk about the strength of our new store pipeline. That pipeline continues to be as strong as ever.\nIt's been just a delight to watch the new store openings this year, especially those bigger boxes that continue to outperform our expectations. There's nothing more fun than walking a brand newly opened store in a market that maybe didn't have a Target or didn't have a Target close to that neighborhood, and to see the response in the community when we open a store. That response is great on the faces and voices of those guests, and it's also great in terms of the incremental sales it provides, and the high returns we see in those new stores.\nThe second place where you'll see us continue to lean in is in-store remodels and refreshing the existing fleet of stores. While we've been talking about that for several years, we've been hard at work, as Brian even touched on in his opening remarks, of remodeling the chain. That work isn't yet finished, and we want to make sure that we're investing in some of the stores that, when we bring our latest and greatest store experience, we see a reliable, strong response from guests. We continue to see strong sales lifts that justify the investment in those remodels. For the stores that haven't yet seen a remodel, we think it's imperative that we bring our latest and greatest thinking.\nThat's a direct investment in the store experience itself, back to the strategy, and the merchandising authority. When we do a remodel, we reallocate the space up to our latest and greatest thinking by strategy, and that helps the merchandising drive some of that sales lift. Importantly, technology will continue to be an area of focus for investment. We know the power of technology to help the humans. The humans that we focus on most there are obviously our guests and our team.\nWherever we can lean in and use technology, it generates returns when we make things more delightful for our guests and the way technology can help with personalization on the app or help us get product to their doorstep faster. For our team, where we can allow the process-focused work of the team to get a boost from technology, that frees up our store team to better serve guests. There are a lot of examples within that CapEx investment, but at its core, does it directly support the areas of focus within the strategy, and do we like the returns? When the answer to those two questions is yes, you're going to see us invest.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nCorey, if I can add just one more thing on top of that. When we add new stores, the added benefit for us is that we continue to build out our fulfillment footprint and capability, and it allows us to also expand our national digital reach as well. There's an added benefit of new stores.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thanks. I forgot to just have a quick follow-up to Michael on your comments on change. I just wanted to double-click on that word specifically and the quotient and the multitude of change that you're thinking about making as we head into 2026, and the benefits that you're seeing from lowering prices on key frequency categories, and how you're thinking about the opportunity to cut further costs potentially because we did talk about investing in agility in terms of SG&A.\nCurious about how you think about the ability for the business to change today and how you're building for the future in that regard. Thanks so much.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah, Corey, if I zoom out, change is going to be incredibly important. I mean, you've heard us say quite plainly, we're not satisfied with our performance over the last few years. While the Q3 came in as expected, you're not going to get a tone of satisfaction from us until that's accompanied by the growth that comes with a positive comp. We've got to do the work. There's no shortcuts, and that means driving change to get different outcomes. We're starting all of that change with really clear priorities. We know how Target is best positioned to uniquely win.\nWhen we lead with great product, when we're design-led and differentiated, and we pair that with an excellent experience, that's what's driven Target's strength in the best of times before, and we think the modern version of that can get the growth outcomes that we want. That does mean doing the work. That means doing the work to make changes like we are in Fun 101 to get different outcomes on the merchandising side. That means making the right investments and driving the change so that that experience can be great in every store every day, in stores and online.\nWe're doing the work, and huge credit to the team that you can see the progress of that work in ways that get us excited about what's to come, even within those Q3 results, because we can see where we've focused and made change. We're getting some of the outcomes that we want. Next year, it'll be about expanding upon that to bring more of those wins across the business at greater scale.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you so much, and best of luck.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nAnalyst, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to drill in a little bit more there on some of the changes. When you're talking about the in-store changes for next year, are there any examples you can give us? I know you mentioned there are key pads within the store, maybe. I'm assuming like the Fun 101, but broadening it out, maybe you could share a few examples. I'd be happy to share a few examples.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target",
    "content2": "Let me start with Fun 101 because we talk about it as a success story, and we are delivering growth, but it's just beginning. We still have more changes to make to Fun 101 to truly make that a family destination that's full of style, trend, design, and pop culture. You're going to see those changes come to life in 2026. The other area that we're making some changes is in home. Home has been a challenge business for us.\nWe are making changes to the product to elevate the style of the product, but then we're also changing the store experience to facilitate more discovery, to facilitate more inspiration, and really stand tall for what will be a revamped, a reinvented Threshold brand. Those are some of the areas we're making changes. Obviously, our contract with Ulta Beauty ends August 2026. Teams are working really hard and coming up with some great ideas for how we'll expand our assortment, and then how we'll also elevate the experience. We'll be able to share more specifics on that at the financial community meeting.\nWe're making some changes in baby. We think baby strategically is a really important category for us. We have historically done very well there. It's an acquisition kind of category. We bring people into Target, and it starts kind of along several years of loyalty as their children grow up. We have an opportunity to make that space a little bit more inviting, a little more inspiration, and also bring more gifting into it. Those are just some headlines of what we're looking at. We'll be in a much better position at financial community meeting to share more specifics on those plans. I got to tell you, I am really excited about these changes.\nI think, as we said in the prepared marks, this is the most change we have made to the store floor pad in 10 years. It's a lot of work, but we're really excited about it.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nAnalyst, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nThat's great. Thanks for that, Rick. That was helpful. Just a quick follow-up. With regard to your Target Circle card, can you talk maybe about some opportunities there? It feels like it's been declining. The penetration of Target Circle card, I guess, has been declining a little bit. I'm just curious as to if you have any reasons as to why that may be and what you can do to kind of recapture some of those customers, maybe where they've gone otherwise.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nSure. I'd be happy to talk about Target Circle. What we love about Target Circle is its huge size. It's one of the biggest loyalty programs in the country. Now with Target Circle 360, we have a membership component to it. What's really exciting about that is it's really helping to fuel our same-day delivery. Target Circle fueled a 35% comp growth in same-day delivery this past quarter, which is really encouraging. The conversations that we're having is now what? How do we continue to innovate and evolve on the platform? Things that we are looking at and trying are early access events with Target Circle 360.\nWe did that this past October with Target Circle Week, and it was really well received. We'll be doing a lot more of that this holiday season. The last point I would make is we're really excited to have the first-party data that we get through Target Circle and be able to leverage that for personalization, particularly through this holiday season. That will be one of the tools in the toolbox that we'll be using.\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target\n\nJoe, if I can just build on the question also specifically on card, if you're referring to what you see in the results from profit sharing, we did see lower spend, a little bit lower penetration, and overall lower balances in the card program. What's important is what Rick just highlighted as we think about our whole loyalty program holistically across Circle, Circle 360, and the card program, and we're very pleased with the results we're seeing so far.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nWhere we do have an opportunity, Joe, is to use where Rick started with that big base of Target Circle as a better on-ramp to folks for whom a Circle card makes a lot of sense. That's a place where we haven't yet achieved our potential. Making sure that we, because we can know a guest in Circle so well, means we should be positioned to know which of them at the right point in time would most like a Circle card too. We've got work to do on that front. We haven't tapped into that to the degree that we would have hoped. You'll see that be an area of focus going forward for us.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nAnalyst, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nThat's great. Thank you, guys, and good luck with the holiday season. Thanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Excuse me, Mike, you might be muted. If you could unmute your phone.\n\nMike Baker\n\nManaging Director, D.A. Davidson\n\nGotcha. Yep. Can you hear me now? Thank you. Okay. I think you said, correct me if I'm wrong, but October flat, yet you're guiding to down low single digits to the Q4. Is that indicative of a little bit of a slowdown post-Halloween? I guess as a follow-up to that, pretty wide range in terms of EPS for the Q4. Can you talk about what you're expecting in terms of margins within that Q4 range and how you get to the low end versus the high end, etc.? Thanks.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah. I'm happy to start, Mike, and Jim, feel free to add on. If you look at, well, the quarter came in where we expected it overall, we definitely did see volatility by month. You heard Jim describe that on a net sales basis, the quarter started with a relatively flat August. We saw a decline in September, and October was about flat. As we step back and think about the Q4, we do it knowing that we saw more volatility by month in Q3 than we would have expected.\nThat factors into how we're thinking about our expectations, but we feel good that we've got the business positioned well heading into Q4. We feel like our top line and bottom line guidance is prudent based on the volatility that we saw in Q3. We start the quarter in a really good place, something we haven't unpacked as much yet. I'll touch on it briefly, inventory is in a great place as we step into the Q4. On the balance sheet, it's down 2%. It's up in our frequency categories, which makes sense given the investments that we're making there, and stronger inventory reliability in in-stocks.\nIt's appropriately down, I think, in an appropriately cautious position in the discretionary categories. We start the quarter where we would want to be positioned from an inventory perspective, and we feel like it's the prudent place to be. Jim, feel free to add as we're thinking about profit for the Q4 or how we've reflected Q3 trends into that view.\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target\n\nYeah, Mike, and if I build upon that, I mean, if you take a step back and look at Q3, obviously, we faced a pretty dynamic environment. As our gross margins and percentage-wise was broadly flat, we're pleased with the performance, and that's in line with expectations. A big thank you to the team to manage and navigate and move quickly with agility to meet the needs of consumers and understand where things are heading. We expect that dynamic to continue in Q4.\nWe do expect a continued volatile environment, which is why there's a little bit still, I guess, a wider range in place because we want to make sure we have the ability to react quickly to changes in the environment. That'll represent the range that we're looking at.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nThe only build I might have, and Rick, feel free to chime in here, is we don't have a perfect crystal ball for exactly how it's going to play out by day or by week in Q4. The thing we feel really good about is how we'll show up for the guests. We've touched a little bit in some of the questions on making sure that we meet the guests where they're at. For us, that's always a couple of things because there are a couple of ingredients of how guests view value. It's the combination of great prices, and you've heard us invest in 3,000 price cuts across food and beverage, and essentials.\nWe're really excited about a Thanksgiving meal for under $20 as we step into Thanksgiving here right around the corner. For Target, it's also pairing that great price with incredible product. I'm just as excited about the 20,000 new items that we'll have this coming Q4, twice as many as last year, as I am about the great pricing guests will find on those items. It's that combination for us that matters so much. On that front, we feel really good about what guests are going to find as they travel the site and the store in the holiday season.\n\nMike Baker\n\nManaging Director, D.A. Davidson\n\nGreat, thank you. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Does that conclude your question?\n\nMike Baker\n\nManaging Director, D.A. Davidson\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We want to drill down a little bit more on your commentary around inventory and in-stocks. Is there any way you can kind of talk to how you feel about the inventory position going into holiday, how it looks versus last year, and just how you see the cadence of in-stocks improving over time?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah, Kate, as I think about inventory broadly, we touched on a little bit of that in Mike's question a second ago. I do think it's important to spend a moment on in-stocks. I would expect, because being in-stock matters so much to our guests, that's a topic you see us come back to over and over and over again in all of these earnings calls to come, because it matters so much. If you've trusted us with a trip to the store, we can't let you down by being out of stock. We haven't been good enough over the last several years on that front.\nWe're laser-focused on improving that, and a huge credit to the team for the progress that we've seen so far. I can dimensionalize that just a little bit more here in a second. I also want to emphasize that work's not done. The bar for the consumer, for our guests, is higher than ever before on that front. You're going to see us continue to lean in to make progress over time. Where we've started is with a really acute focus on those most frequently purchased items, where if we're out of stock, it hurts more if you're a guest and we've let you down. You heard in my remarks the focus on our top items.\nThink of those as the 5,000 most frequently purchased items. They account for about 30% of our unit sales, so a big piece of what guests are finding and buying every day at Target. As the team has leaned in to make progress on that subset of items, it comes in a whole bunch of ways. It comes with embracing the use of technology to help us forecast better and be more in stock that way. It comes with us having a better view of how we're really performing. We've described before, we've changed some of the measures we use for in-stocks that give us a clearer mirror than ever before of where we're doing great and where we're falling down.\nThat's been really helpful because it's told us, okay, we might be okay on average in some places, but we're not good enough at the end of the day, or we have a shortfall on weekends that we need to address. Teams have been hard at work in moving the needle there. On the measures that we move, you heard me describe a 150 basis point improvement in Q3. If you're not close to the work, it's maybe tough to appreciate how big that progress is. What I like is that's better year-over-year improvement in Q3, performance versus last year, than we saw in Q2, which was better than we saw in Q1.\nThat trajectory gets me really excited that we're doing the right work to get a different outcome. If we can keep that progress up, and I have a ton of confidence that that's exactly what we'll do, we'll be more and more in stock as we move through 2026 than we were in 2025.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nOperator, I think we have time for one more question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. You just outlined a lot of the progress that you're making on key operational metrics such as in-stocks and speed to market, yet we really haven't seen it translate to an overall improvement in the performance of the business. The obvious question is, why not? What, as outsiders, is a reasonable timeframe for holding the team accountable for showing that progress? Thank you.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Michael. Here's what I'd say. We're not satisfied with the top-line performance of the business, even as it's come in as we expected in Q3. We're doing the work with urgency. As a team, our focus is to get back to growth. We know that won't happen overnight, but we know what the path is. We're focused on making progress. We see momentum where we're making that investment.\nA huge credit to the team to do the work that's going to get that outcome over time. We'll unpack more what our expectations for next year look like when we get to the financial community meeting in March. I feel really good that we've got a team focused on doing the work now that will lead to growth over time. Rest assured, we are tackling that work with urgency.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay. My follow-up question is, if I could just ask one more thing.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nOne more on Michael. Go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much, Michael. I appreciate it. I will add my best wishes to Brian. Thank you very much for this. You've already outlined the billion dollars of incremental CapEx for next year. Perhaps there might be some incremental operating investments that could take down the profitability a bit next year. How, amongst those guardrails, are you thinking about the commitment to the dividend and the importance of that to your certain shareholders moving forward?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nWell, and Jim, feel free to pile onto this one if you'd like. You've heard us describe our support and strong support over time of the dividend, Michael. You shouldn't expect anything to change there. We've been consistent in our capital priorities for as far back as I can remember in my 23 years here. It starts with making the right investments in the business. The $5 billion we'll put to work next year. We're really excited. We'll generate the returns and the growth that warrant that level of investment. The dividend is always the second priority, and I think our track record speaks for itself in terms of our support of the dividend.\nShare repurchase is the with-what's-left piece that we'll always adjust as appropriate, but the dividend sits second in that priority list for a reason.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood luck with the holiday. Thank you. All right. Thanks, Michael. That brings us to the end of today's call. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and engagement.",

Welcome to the Target Corporation Q1 Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. At the close of prepared remarks, we will open the queue for Q&A session. At that time, if you have a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, 21 May 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Gomez, Chief Commercial Officer; Michael Fiddelke, Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Lee, Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Brian, Rick, Michael, and Jim will provide their insights on our Q1 performance, along with their outlook and priorities for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Jim and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.\nFinally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As I begin today, I want to pause and thank our team. Throughout the quarter, the Target team of more than 400,000 employees across the country stayed focused on what's most important: serving our guests, supporting each other, and delivering trend, style, convenience, and value. At Target, our roadmap for growth serves as a guide for bringing the best of our brand to life each day. This includes our assortment of on-trend, affordable products and an experience that prioritizes ease, convenience, and a personal touch with every interaction, all at an incredible value. These are the things that make Target Target, and we remain confident that our strategy will allow us to continue bringing joy to millions of American families while, importantly, paving the way for long-term profitable growth.\nIn the first quarter, our team and our business faced an exceptionally challenging environment that affected our performance with declines in both traffic and sales, most notably in our discretionary categories. For several years now, we've seen pressure in our discretionary businesses as spending adjusted down from elevated levels during the pandemic and then moved further away in the face of historically high inflation in needs-based categories. On top of those ongoing challenges, we faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on belonging in January. While we believe each of these factors played a role in our Q1 performance, we can't reliably estimate the impact of each one separately.\nI want to be clear that we're not satisfied with this performance, and we're moving with urgency to navigate through this period of volatility. Throughout our operations, we're focused on consistency and reliability with an emphasis on retail fundamentals and delivering a superior guest experience that features newness, differentiation, and value. For the summer season, we're offering more than 10,000 new items starting at just $1. In the popular Bullseye's Playground, we will continue offering items at $1, $3, and $5, and we're expanding this assortment to include beauty items as well as trending snacks and beverages. And by July, we'll shift to the critical back-to-school and college season, standing tall for value as we focus on supporting families during key life moments.\nWe're also finding new ways to move faster and operate differently, given that uncertainty and the pace of change are higher than ever. This morning, we announced the formation of an Enterprise Acceleration Office, which Michael will be leading, as well as several organizational changes to bring even more clarity and speed to how we operate and advance our strategy across the company. As I said in this morning's announcement, this effort goes beyond improving efficiency with a focus on greater adaptability, innovation, resilience, and ultimately growth. Based on his expertise and the insights he's gained for more than 20 years at this company, Michael is the perfect leader for this work.\nAs you'll hear from Rick, the merchandising team has been working tirelessly to mitigate the impact of tariffs, and the difficulty level has been incredibly high given the magnitude of the rates we're facing and a high degree of uncertainty on how these rates and impacted categories might evolve. As a company that aims to deliver great products and outstanding value, we're focused on supporting American families as they manage their budgets. We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs, and price is the very last resort. Our strategy is to remain price competitive by leveraging the capabilities, long-standing relationships, and the scale that set us apart from many of our retail peers. For example, we're fortunate to have a sourcing team with decades of experience and strong partnerships with our global suppliers.\nAs we're engaging in contingency planning with those vendor partners, we're moving thoughtfully and contemplating a wide range of potential scenarios, and we're building our plans to preserve maximum flexibility while protecting our business in the face of massive potential costs. At the same time, we remain committed to supporting this year's investment plans in support of our long-term growth. These investments include an outstanding pipeline of new stores, ongoing remodels of existing locations, and robust investments in technology and our supply chain.\nBecause of this company's long history of disciplined financial management, we have a strong balance sheet and ample cash that will allow us to navigate through these near-term challenges as we continue to invest in making us even stronger over time. In planning for the remainder of the year, we believe it's prudent to expect that current top-line pressures will continue in the near term. However, the results in the quarter provided several key insights that reinforced our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and Target's continued relevance with American consumers. Among those high points, we saw mid-single-digit growth in our first-party digital business this quarter, led by 36% growth in same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360.\nWe also saw continued healthy growth in drive-up, which now accounts for nearly half of our total digital sales. Of course, beyond the direct benefits of rising digital sales, they also fuel the growth of profitable services like Roundel, our retail ad business, and Target Plus, our third-party digital marketplace, both of which saw double-digit growth in Q1. Target's strength has been and will always be our products, partnerships, and incredible value, especially today as consumers feel increased pressure. We aim to deliver everyday discovery and delight. This connection between Target and our guests came through during key seasonal moments in the Q1, including both the Valentine's Day and Easter holidays. In addition, we were pleased with the guest response to our most recent Target Circle week as we offered compelling promotions across multiple categories.\nAnd of course, we were really pleased with the success of our limited-time design partnership with Kate Spade. Target has long been famous for these programs, and sales results from the Kate Spade partnership were the strongest we've seen in a decade. This highlights the power of the Target brand, our continued style authority, and our best-in-class design and sourcing capabilities, which come together to deliver a singular combination of fashion, quality, and price. Progress on inventory shrink was another bright spot in the quarter as rates continued to moderate from extreme levels we encountered in 2022 and 2023. And as Michael will highlight later, we're pleased with the performance of the long-term investments we're making in our business, including the return on our investments from new locations and the boost in traffic and sales from our store remodeling projects.\nIn a period of volatility and rapid change, we are absolutely focused on what we do best, providing the best retail experience for nearly 2,000 communities we're proud to serve. We're a company that aims to bring joy to everyone every day, and we're proud to be one of the largest employers in the United States. We believe in creating opportunity for all and developing talent to fuel our business, which includes pathways for promotions, industry-leading pay and benefits, and outstanding education and training. We provide tuition assistance through our Dream to Be program, with more than 30,000 team members enrolling in the program since its launch in 2023. Simply put, what we do wouldn't be possible without the incredible Target team.\nMaking meaningful connections within our communities is also part of being a great retailer, and we take our commitment to serving the communities in which we operate seriously. Our team volunteers one million hours a year with local organizations, and we will continue, as we have for more than 60 years, to donate 5% of our profits back to the community. Of course, we continue to work with a large and diverse base of vendors and suppliers, ranging from big national brands to a host of small emerging brands who help us to offer the one-of-a-kind assortment our guests expect from us. Every day in everything we do, we will continue to be anchored in the belief that creating an environment where people feel included, supported, and respected makes us a stronger company. It helps us build and support our talented team, serve millions of guests in all 50 states, and be a valued partner in the communities we serve.\nAs I get ready to turn the call over to Rick, I want to pause and thank our team once again. I'm proud of their resilience and long-term focus. I'm confident we're taking the right steps to accelerate our progress, deliver more of what our guests love, and to usher in the next chapter of Target's growth story. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian shared, our team had to navigate through multiple challenges in the first quarter. Despite these challenges, we saw some compelling proof points that our strategy continues to resonate with consumers. As we've shared for multiple quarters, consumers have been choiceful in their buying decisions, and recent declines in consumer confidence have made them even more cautious. They're focused on finding ways to save as they manage their family's budget. However, as we've noted before, consumers are still making discretionary purchases when they find products at the right intersection of style, quality, and value. We saw these themes play out in our Q1 results, where guests focused their spending on seasonal assortments, newness, and compelling promotions.\nQ1 net sales were down 2.8%, reflecting a decline in traffic as well as a lower average basket. Within our six core merchandising categories, there are 35 divisions for which we measure market share. We held our gain share in 15 of those 35 over the trailing three months, with strong gains in apparel categories like women's swimwear, performance, and toddler, as well as gains in seasonal merchandise, books, and produce and floral. While we are pleased to see those positive results, our goal is to hold or grow share across the majority of our assortment. As such, we are not satisfied with our Q1 performance, and we are laser-focused on improving these trends over time.\nTarget has long been known as the go-to place for key moments, including holidays, the turning of the seasons, and other celebrations. In the Q1, top-line trends got meaningfully stronger around Valentine's Day and Easter. In addition, as weather has warmed up across the country, we are seeing momentum in categories like outdoor toys, pool accessories, and summer food and beverage items. And of course, beyond seasonal moments, we also create unique-to-Target collaborations like our latest design partnership, Kate Spade for Target. Target pioneered the idea of making fashion affordable for all. And though we've been doing this for decades, our guests still love and eagerly await these collaborations.\nAs Brian shared, the Kate Spade collection was the most successful limited-time partnership we have had in more than a decade, reinforcing Target's style authority and our ability to work with the most sought-after designers. It also showed that newness and style at irresistible price points can drive demand in otherwise soft discretionary categories. This is something we'll continue to lean into going forward. But consumers aren't just seeking newness and value during seasonal moments. They want and expect it every day. For example, in toys and sporting goods, our expanded assortment of items priced under $20 is performing well as we look to help families find even more affordable joy at Target.\nAnd in apparel, we saw strength in categories like women's swim, where new own-brand offerings at competitive price points beginning at just $12 provide the style and affordability consumers are looking for. Another way we deliver newness and value is through our Target Plus marketplace, where we have set ambitious goals to grow GMV to $5 billion by 2030 by offering even more brands and products guests want and expect from Target. We're looking to achieve this across all our core categories, with particular focus on home and apparel, where breadth of assortment matters most to consumers.\nThis quarter alone, we grew Target Plus GMV by more than 20%, adding hundreds of new partners to the platform, driving traffic, and increasing conversion online. Another way we deliver value to our guests is through Target Circle, and they responded enthusiastically to our recent Target Circle week, which offered compelling promotions on great products. Beyond the short-term traffic and sales benefit, these events help position Target as a value player at a time when that's more important than ever. Before turning to our plans for Q2, I want to pause and re-emphasize that while we are encouraged by these bright spots, our overall results are not delivering at the level we want. We have work to do, and our teams are aligned and committed to improving our performance and returning this company to growth over time.\nLooking ahead to the Q2 and beyond, a key focus will be navigating the ever-changing tariff landscape as we work to deliver on our business goals while doing what we do best: providing outstanding product at incredible prices. Our teams have been hard at work to minimize tariff headwinds through multiple strategies, including negotiating with our vendor partners, reevaluating assortment decisions, changing country of production where we are able, adjusting order timing, and where necessary, adjusting prices. We're building these plans with a premium on flexibility, allowing our team to read and react to changing tariff impacts and consumer trends as we navigate through the uncertainty. All in, these efforts are expected to offset the vast majority of the incremental tariff exposure, thanks to the incredible work of our team.\nBut even as we plan for these current pressures to continue, we're also placing smart bets in key areas focused on the latest styles, trends, and cultural moments. Given our strong affinity with the Nintendo brand, we're excited for this summer's arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. We're one of the top retailers in the US for this launch and can't wait to bring joy to families with this highly anticipated release. Given our brand purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life, throughout the summer season, we'll be leaning in, offering style-forward, mix-and-match, red, white, and blue outfit options for the whole family and more than 10,000 new summer items starting at just $1 and most of the assortment under $20. And by the end of Q2, the focus shifts to the return-to-school routines.\nWith back-to-school and college representing the second biggest season of the year, we're planning to deliver our unique mix of style and affordability. In our back-to-school assortment, we're standing tall for value, ensuring every student gets the supplies they need for a successful school year. And for our college-bound guests, we're creating an easy-to-shop assortment of on-trend, affordable, mix-and-match items to personalize their dorm rooms. Finally, as we focus on building engagement with new and existing Target Circle 360 members, we're implementing changes to make same-day delivery even more affordable through an industry-leading offering. As you know, for items delivered same day from Target, we've never marked up prices, and now we're extending that policy for all other retailers on the platform.\nBeginning this week, we've introduced no-price markups on same-day delivery for the more than 100 retailers available on Shipt’s Marketplace. Many membership programs provide access to only one retailer, and others offer deliveries from multiple retailers but charge additional fees. With Target Circle 360, members get unlimited same-day delivery with a personal shopper and access to Shipt’s Marketplace of more than 100 other retailers like Petco, CVS, Lowe's, Publix, and more.\nBefore I turn things over to Michael, I want to acknowledge just how hard the Target team works to serve our guests, to care for each other, and to bring the Target brand to life. You truly are the best team in retail, and I particularly want to say thank you for your tireless efforts to navigate the complexities and the challenges of the current environment. Thank you for all you do for Target and for the millions of families we are proud to serve. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nThanks, Rick. I'd like to start this morning where Rick left off with a huge thank you to our team. From our sourcing offices overseas to the teams in our stores and supply chain facilities and everyone at our headquarters, the current environment is incredibly challenging, and you all continue to navigate it with determination, agility, and an unwavering focus on serving our guests. Thank you for all that you do every day. Despite the challenges currently facing our business, our teams are making meaningful progress against the priorities we laid out in our recent financial community meeting, including improved in-stocks and inventory reliability, faster and more efficient digital fulfillment, continued investments in both the in-store and digital shopping experience, and bringing the best of Target to more communities.\nFirst, regarding inventory reliability, we remain focused on improving overall in-stock levels with a particular focus on top-selling items and peak shopping periods. And while there's still work to do, we're making real progress. In virtually every way we measure inventory availability, from the overall purchasability of our total assortment to the in-stock position on key items, we've seen improvement year over year, building on the increases we've delivered for well over a year now. And thanks to the many efforts of our team, we've continued to make very compelling progress on inventory shrink with far better results earlier in the year than we expected, helping to improve our inventory reliability as well as our profitability. One additional note on inventory, which was up 11% over last year.\nGiven slower-than-expected sales, we are taking actions to right-size inventory, which puts some profit pressure on the business in Q1 and will likely lead to some incremental markdowns and receipt adjustment costs in the Q2 as well. We believe these actions in the first half of this year will rebalance inventory well heading into the back half. Jim will share more on this shortly. Beyond inventory reliability, we also want to ensure that when our guests place digital orders, they are fulfilled quickly and efficiently. I'm pleased that in Q1, our average click-to-deliver speed was nearly 20% faster compared to last year, one of many factors contributing to our strong digital growth.\nOf course, when guests are focused on speed, our same-day services rise to the occasion, one of many reasons they grew another 5% over last year in the Q1. Altogether, with continued growth of our same-day services and the expansion of next-day shipping availability across the country, we fulfilled more than 70% of all Q1 digital orders within a day, a strong base for us to build upon. One of the ways we're increasing shipping speed is by utilizing Shipt's network of independent drivers to deliver packages from sortation centers and, in some cases, directly from stores.\nIn Q1, Shipt drivers fulfilled 24% more packages year over year, speeding up delivery and reducing costs at the same time. We see a lot of room to continue increasing the adoption of services like drive-up and same-day delivery while we also expand next-day shipping to more and more guests over time. Among our same-day services, we're seeing the most rapid growth in same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360, which increased by more than 35% this quarter.\nAs guest engagement with this membership service continues to grow, we're continually looking for ways to deliver even greater differentiation and value. So as Rick shared earlier, we're excited about our latest benefit for Target Circle 360 members: no markups on same-day delivery orders from Target and now the more than 100 retailers included on Shipt’s Marketplace. And we know that the ability to get free deliveries from multiple retailers is valuable to our members. Here's one way to think about it. When we choose where to open physical stores, we're intentional about selecting locations that are convenient for our guests and situated near other prominent retailers. This strategic placement not only increases visibility but also drives relevance and foot traffic by aligning our brand with familiar and complementary shopping destinations. We apply the same philosophy to Target Circle 360.\nBy offering same-day delivery from a wide variety of retailers through Shipt’s Marketplace, we create a digital environment that mirrors the high-traffic, high-relevance experience of a bustling retail center. This proximity, whether physical or virtual, enhances discovery, encourages cross-shopping, and builds affinity and relevance for the Target brand. And of course, we continue to invest in our physical stores, opening new locations and updating existing ones, not just to bring our latest strategies and ideas to life but also to support the continued expansion of our digital business. Now, we often get questions about how we allocate investments between our stores and our supply chain facilities.\nAnd while we do invest in both types of assets separately, it's important to note that an investment in our stores is also an investment in our supply chain due to our unique stores-as-hubs model. This model works because of our differentiated assortment strategy and our proximity to consumers, allowing our stores to play a dual role: serving as an inspiring shopping destination and as the primary source for fulfilling online orders. As a result, in Q1, 96% of our net sales volume was fulfilled by our stores. This past quarter, we added three new store locations around the country, and we're on track to open around 20 for the year. Additionally, given the strong returns on investment we see, we've launched another wave of store remodel projects this spring.\nIn fact, for the store remodels we've completed in recent years, we've seen strong comp lifts following the completion of these projects of 2% to 4% in the year following a remodel and a nearly 3% incremental lift in year two as well, another indication that our guests love newness, including in the store shopping experience. And in both our new and existing locations, our store teams want to provide a warm, friendly, and helpful experience on every guest visit. It's why we're encouraged to see increasing Net Promoter Scores on top of already high ratings on metrics including the ability to find products, overall wait time at checkout, and interactions with our team both while shopping and at our check lanes.\nBut as I said at our financial community meeting, and I'll say again this morning, we won't confuse progress with potential. We have work to do. As we announced earlier this morning, we're taking action to return our business to growth with greater speed and intention. As you heard from Brian, I'll be leading a newly created acceleration office for the enterprise aimed at removing friction and enabling the team to make faster decisions in support of our growth. To be clear, we still firmly believe in our differentiated strategy, but in today's environment, we need to become more agile and move with greater speed. Through this office, I'll partner with leaders across the organization to more boldly embrace and harness the power of technology and AI beyond what we are already deploying.\nAs a natural extension of our roadmap for growth, our priority will be enabling more efficient and cost-effective ways to work. But this work goes beyond improving efficiency and includes finding ways to use assets more effectively and more intentionally prioritizing the work of our team, allowing them to move faster than we have in the past. For example, we have some compelling technology projects in flight that will modernize and streamline core inventory management and allocation processes. Our aim is to move them forward with pace. I'll have far more details to share over time, but for now, I want to emphasize that our team is fully committed to this work so we can more quickly deliver on the long-term aspirations we have for our business.\nAs I get ready to turn the call over to Jim, I want to reiterate a point I made a few months ago and again this morning. We are pleased with the progress we've made in support of the long-term growth we know we can achieve, but we know we can do more faster. And there's no shortage of urgency and passion from this team to return to growth and solidify our position as a leader in American retail. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Lee\n\nCFO, Target\n\nThanks, Michael. As Brian mentioned earlier, we faced several sources of pressure on the top line this quarter. Sales declined 2.8% as a comparable sales decline of 3.8% was partially offset by the benefit of new store sales, and double-digit growth in non-merchandise sales. Among the drivers of our comp sales, traffic declined 2.4% while average ticket was down 1.4%. Q1 GAAP EPS was $2.27 and included $0.97 of benefit from the favorable resolution of interchange fee litigation for which we were the plaintiff. Adjusted EPS, which excludes that 97-cent benefit, was $1.30 compared to $2.03 last year.\nOn the gross margin line, our Q1 rate of 28.2% was about 60 basis points lower than last year, reflecting about a point of pressure in merchandising driven primarily by higher markdowns, along with about 80 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain, partially offset by about 120 basis points of favorability from lower inventory shrink. On the SG&A line, our reported rate of 19.3% was about 170 basis points lower than last year as the gains from the litigation settlements were recognized on this line. Excluding those gains, our underlying first quarter SG&A rate was 21.7%, about 70 basis points higher than last year as pressure from sales deleverage and continued team investments were partially offset by the benefit of our cost improvement efforts.\nI want to pause and acknowledge the team's disciplined focus on productivity as underlying SG&A expenses, excluding the gains from litigation, grew less than 1% compared with last year, even as we continued investing in team member pay and benefits. Our Q1 D&A rate of 2.7% was about 20 basis points higher than a year ago, reflecting a year-over-year increase in depreciation on capital projects as we ramp up activity from last year's pace. Altogether, our Q1 operating margin rate was 6.2%, including about 250 basis points of benefit from the legal settlements. Turning now to capital deployment, our priorities remain the same as they've been for decades. Our first priority is to invest fully in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and increase it annually.\nAnd third, we deploy any excess cash for share repurchases within the limits of our investment-grade credit ratings. CapEx in Q1 was $790 million, and based on updated estimates of project timing, we're now expecting our full-year CapEx will be near the lower end of the $4 to 5 billion range we laid out for the year. Regarding the second priority, we paid $510 million in dividends in Q1, and we'll recommend that the board authorize a small increase in the quarterly dividend later this year. And finally, we deployed about $250 million for share repurchase in Q1, retiring 2.2 million of our shares. However, with increasing uncertainty regarding the magnitude and timing of potential tariffs, we did not repurchase any shares in April.\nRecent news of moderating tariff rates has been very encouraging and may open the door for additional repurchase activity later in the year. Of course, the magnitude and timing of repurchases will be governed by our long-held capital priorities and ratings goals. As we look ahead, we remain confident in the underlying health of our business and our strategy, and we have a clear plan for navigating through this challenging environment. When we provided our initial guidance back in March, we said that we expected disproportionate pressure in the first half of the year, most notably in the first quarter. More specifically, we said that we expected to see Q1 pressure from team member investments, healthcare, general liability, and startup costs from our capital investments.\nTogether, these items accounted for about $0.50 of year-over-year pressure on our Q1 Adjusted EPS. In addition, we faced pressure from lower-than-expected sales, which resulted in higher-than-expected markdowns. Offsetting these pressures were significant savings from lower inventory shrink and the benefit of cost efficiency and productivity efforts on the SG&A line. We expect many of those Q1 themes to persist in the Q2, with headwinds including continued sales pressure, tariff impacts, and some additional costs to adjust inventory and receipts, with continued benefits from lower shrink and productivity gains. In the back half of the year, we will be lapping easier comparisons from 2024 and expect to have inventory and receipt adjustment costs behind us.\nFor the full year, we believe it's prudent to plan for a low single-digit decline in our sales in line with our Q1 performance. Based on these lower expected sales, we anticipate downward pressure on profitability with meaningful offsets from lower shrink and cost initiatives. Altogether, we've updated our adjusted EPS guidance to an expected range of about $7 to $9 for the full year. This wider range reflects the expected impact of tariffs and heightened uncertainty regarding the economy and consumer spending. In terms of GAAP EPS, our updated range is about a dollar higher from $8 to $10 due to gains we recognize from the litigation settlements.\nImportantly, our updated full-year adjusted EPS range includes a number of near-term costs that we don't expect to repeat in future years, including actions in response to tariff announcements, and inventory and receipt adjustment costs on softer-than-expected sales. The expected impact of these headwinds is similar in magnitude to the offsetting GAAP EPS benefit from the litigation settlements. As such, we believe this year's expected GAAP EPS range is a better reflection of the ongoing profitability of our business.\nIn the near term, given the challenges we're facing, we're managing the business with two overarching priorities for the year. The first is to ensure that we deliver solid performance in 2025, with shrink and productivity improvements offsetting the impact of softer-than-expected sales, while best positioning our business for meaningfully better results in 2026 and beyond. We'll do this by focusing on the appropriate growth drivers, managing our costs to match the pace of sales, and ensuring we exit 2025 in a healthy position in terms of profit margins and inventory levels. The other priority is to continue investing in our business, including in our stores, distribution centers, and in technology, including AI, to ensure we're positioned to deliver the long-term profitable growth we know our business can deliver over time.\nI want to join the other speakers this morning in thanking our team, both for their commitment to serving our guests and their disciplined focus on productivity and efficiency in a highly challenging environment. I also want to reiterate some of the bright spots you've heard about this morning, including digital growth of around 5%, led by 36% growth in same-day delivery, encouraging performance during seasonal moments like Valentine's Day, Easter, and most recently, Mother's Day, holding or gaining share in just under half of the categories we track, the best performance of a designer partnership in a decade, and continued strong returns on our investments in new stores, remodels, and technology. We're looking to build on these bright spots in the quarters and years ahead while increasing our speed and agility under Michael's leadership of the acceleration office.\nAnd while a volatile trade environment will likely remain a challenge for a while longer, we're fortunate to have a strong and experienced global sourcing team and a healthy balance sheet that will allow us to weather significant volatility and continue to invest in our business, while others in a weaker position may struggle. We're confident that if we continue to focus on the long game, we will benefit from meaningful growth and market share opportunities in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThanks, Jim. Before we turn to your questions, I want to emphasize a few things you've heard from us today. First, while we're not satisfied with our current performance, we are confident in our strategy and our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth by bringing together our cross-category mix of national brands, own brands, and unique partnerships. With an experience that prioritizes ease, value, and a personal touch, we are delivering the everyday discovery and delight that makes Target Target, while modernizing our approach for today's consumer. This is what we leaned into our competitive strengths to build the industry-leading fulfillment model we have today, one that continues to drive strong digital sales and growth in same-day services like drive-up and same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360.\nWe are leaning into those same strengths to further differentiate our assortment and experiences with investments in Target Circle, Roundel, Target Plus, and more. Which leads me to my second point. We are committed to delivering on our strategic priorities faster. With the Enterprise Acceleration Office, we're changing how we operate to create the conditions for our team to advance our priorities more quickly and remain adaptable to the changing landscape for our business. This will not only help us meet the demands of today's environment, but enhance our performance for years to come. And finally, I want to emphasize that Target is well-prepared to navigate the near-term challenges of today while continuing to invest in the future.\nWe are in the fortunate position of having the scale, relationships, and balance sheet to weather uncertainty with a focus on delivering value to our guests. At the same time, we'll keep investing in our stores, supply chain, and technology so that we are well-positioned to serve guests both today and over time. And our unwavering commitment to bringing joy to everyone every day will continue to guide everything we do. All of this is possible because of our team, and I appreciate all they've done and continue to do to support our guests and each other.\nSo today, even as I'm not satisfied with our Q1 results, I'm confident in our strategy, the actions we're taking to accelerate that strategy, and the ability of our team to move our business forward and emerge a stronger company than before. With that, we'll open up the line for Q&A. Now, Rick, Michael, Jim, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. To withdraw your request, press star two. Our first question will come from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Thanks and good morning, everybody. So my first question is a little bit on the guidance. Is your expectation that comps turn positive in the back half or by the Q4? And on the gross margin line, will the inventory adjustment cost essentially be behind you, such that in the back half, the shrink tailwinds in advertising and so forth will allow gross margin to be up? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nJim, go ahead.\n\nJim Lee\n\nCFO, Target\n\nYeah, sure, Chris. On the comps, as I indicated, we expect to have low single-digit declines for the balance of the year, and that would include Q4. And as Michael mentioned on the call, the inventory and receipt adjustment costs we expect to occur mostly in the first half of the year, and then we'll get through that by the second half of the year.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot you. And then on the shrink line, that 120, it seems like that would suggest you're pretty close to getting back to 2019 in terms of recapturing all the shrink. Is that 120 a good number to think about for the rest of the year, or was this some sort of catch-up adjustment that happened in Q1 that doesn't persist into the balance of the year? Thank you.\n\nJim Lee\n\nCFO, Target\n\nChris, you got that right. I think there's an element of catch-up as we do the store counts that gets to the 120 basis points of shrink upside. For the balance of the year, you can expect that we'll recover the vast majority of the shrink that we saw, the headwinds we saw over the last couple of years.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI guess any quantification of what that is?\n\nJim Lee\n\nCFO, Target\n\nAs you recall, we've tried to claw back 120 basis points of headwinds. We clawed back about 40 last year, and we look like we'll recover the vast majority of that of the balance.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Have a great rest of spring. Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask about tariffs. Rick mentioned that your efforts are expected to offset the vast majority of the incremental tariff exposure. But can you talk a little bit more about how you're going about that and what your view is on prices in the back half, and any demand elasticity? And when it comes to what we see in the stores for a holiday, would you expect it to look much different versus previous years?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nRick, do you want to provide some color on tariffs?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nSure, I'd be happy to. And I think I'd start by saying, as we think through and navigate tariffs, the first thing that we're committing to is to deliver high-quality product at affordable prices. And that really is our North Star. And our teams have been working very hard to offset the vast majority of the tariffs. And we're doing that because, are able to do that because of Target's size and scale, our multi-category business, which gives us flexibility, the productive partnerships that we have built with our vendors and suppliers, and then our best-in-class global sourcing team has put us in a good position to be able to navigate these tariffs. Now, the strategies that the teams are employing as we speak include diversifying the country of production. Half of what we sell comes from the US.\nBut beyond that, we have the most control of where we produce when it comes to our own brands. And with our own brands, we have been on a multi-year journey to diversify countries of production. So going back to 2017, we were 60% coming out of China. We've brought that down to 30%, and we are well on our way to be less than 25% by the end of next year. We are expanding into new countries, Asia, as well as the Western Hemisphere. But I think it's important to note that we're also exploring opportunities here in the US. The other strategy that the team's employing is evolving our assortment. We talked a little bit about this in the prepared comments. But Bullseye's Playground, I think, is a great example. It's at the front of the store.\nIt's the section where guests come in and they look to discover fun, seasonal, low-priced items. We have made a commitment to keep those at $1, $3, and $5. It's important to the brand, but it's important to the guest. To do that, we've evolved the assortment, and we've brought in some new trending beauty items, and we've also brought in some new seasonal food and beverage items. The last point I would say is we are partnering very closely with our vendors and our suppliers to ensure that we are able to provide the best value that we can for the consumer. Through all those strategies, we feel that we can offset the vast majority of the tariff impact.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nIt almost builds on several of Rick's comments. I think we all know the tariff environment right now is still very uncertain. And we're certainly working and looking for greater clarity around trade agreements and what the long-term tariff rates will be. But I want to recognize the work that Rick's team has done, Michael's team, Jim's team, in an environment where you can imagine lots of scenario planning, but with a focus on delivering what's best for our consumer in this environment, making sure we leverage our multi-category portfolio, our own brands, the experience of our sourcing team, and making sure that we're delivering newness and value, and remaining price competitive in an environment that's rapidly changing. So we'll continue to provide updates as we go forward, as we mitigate through the tariff uncertainty.\nBut I think the teams have done a tremendous job in making sure we start with the consumer, we continue to deliver great product, great value, and remain price competitive in this environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to in-store comp trends. So as you look forward, what are some of the key efforts, tactics to help drive stronger traffic in-store trends? And then as you look at your business today, how do you feel about your price gaps and price positioning?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nI'm happy to start. Rupesh, as we sit here today, and you heard this from Michael, you heard this from Rick, we start with a focus on good retail fundamentals. We've got to make sure in this environment we are consistent, reliable. That's code for making sure we're in stock every time you shop. We've got to make sure we provide a great in-store experience. That starts with great assortments, great newness, and great value. We've got to be really laser-focused on providing a great in-store experience every time our guests shop. So Michael, Rick, their entire teams, we are focused on this each and every day. It starts with great retail fundamentals, making sure we're focused on managing inventory effectively, continue to provide the great service our guests are looking for. It's that combination, as Rick talked about.\nWe've got to make sure style, trend, fashion, that Target magic is something we lead with. We complement that with great essentials, great food and beverage, and great execution each and every day.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nYeah. I mean, just to build on that a little bit, Brian, we have said that we weren't happy with our performance in Q1, but there were some bright spots. And when we saw that we brought style, trend, and high-quality product at an affordable price, the consumer responded. And we saw that with Kate Spade and delivering the biggest designer collaboration that we've had in over a decade. We also saw that when it came to Valentine's Day, Easter, and more recently Mother's Day, that Target continues to be the go-to destination for seasons. So we're excited for our plans for Q2 because we're going to take those learnings and we're going to lean into that and drive traffic and sales in Q2. We are going to celebrate 100 days of summer from Memorial Day all the way to Labor Day.\nWe're going to be launching 10,000 new items starting at $1 with the majority under $20. We're going to be sharing our take on Americana, Americana done the Target way, red, white, and blue for the whole apparel, for the whole family. That looks terrific. We'll have in-store events every Saturday in June. We're going to have increases in summer media to drive traffic to those events and to drive traffic to the store and to our site. Of course, we've got a couple of really big launches this summer that we're excited about. The first will be Nintendo Switch 2. Based on the pre-orders, there's a ton of excitement for this. We plan to be the retail destination for all things Nintendo Switch. The other big launch that we have is Champion. Champion is really the epitome of Target.\nIt's stylish sportswear for the whole family at really affordable prices. We think that's going to be a big hit with the consumer as well. We're taking the learnings from Q1, and we're leaning in big time in Q2 to drive traffic and to drive improved performance.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nI might just build on that a little bit as well to emphasize the point Brian started with. Those fundamentals matter. I mean, we know some of what makes the Target experience special is a great in-store experience. The team navigated a lot of challenges in Q1. Amidst that tough backdrop, we made progress on some of the goals that we set out at our financial community meeting. In virtually every way we measure in stores, we're stronger this year than we were last year. We look really closely at what our guests are telling us they're seeing in terms of experience. We saw some nice steps forward in the measures we use from a Net Promoter Score perspective to see progress there.\nThen we're laying good foundation that will serve us well in the balance of this year and beyond in places where we're getting faster with shipping. That 20% increase year over year in our click-to-deliver speed, that's going to be a benefit our guests are going to see for months and months to come. So a huge thanks to the team for making that progress. We said at the start of the year, we had some work to do to get to a higher bar on some of those fundamentals. We took a nice step forward in the Q1, and we're not done.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target",
    "content2": "I think there was part of the question was also price gaps. There's a lot covered in the question, but we want to go back and cover that. What I would say on price gaps is, first and foremost, we are very committed to delivering value to the guests and to deliver competitive pricing. We watch competitive pricing very closely, and we watch price gaps. For now, we are comfortable with where our price gaps are. But I do think it is important to think of value more broadly than just price. We think about it in a lot of different ways. One way in particular is with Target Circle 360, is how we deliver value with promotions. One of the things we're really excited about right now is a new benefit that we're adding to Target Circle 360.\nNow, we have never had markups for same-day delivery of Target orders. But now we're going to offer no markups for hundreds of retailers on the Shipt platform. This is going to offer incredible value as well as ease and convenience for our members. So it's just important to think about value more broadly. We like to think of the Target value as price plus style and ease and convenience.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThank you for our caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. In order to address some of the challenges, it seems necessary to diagnose the problem. Is it right to characterize that the challenge that Target has experienced in the last few years is that other retailers have caught up and addressed some of the differentiation and qualities that have made Target unique? As Target has tried to catch up, its execution has become less consistent. Now, to try and address these issues, the focus is on improving execution. Is that right? And is it enough? Thank you very much. Then I have a follow-up.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nMichael, it's a great question. I think we've talked about that quite a bit this morning. And you've heard Michael talk about it. It starts with retail fundamentals. We know we've got to be reliable. We've got to be consistent. We've got to make sure we are managing inventory effectively in this environment. We've got to continue to make progress with shrink. Those are fundamentals each and every day that are embedded in our business. Rick's talked about the importance of blending newness with great assortments, bringing that style, that trend, that Target magic forward each and every day. That's part of the value equation we've got to be delivering. We know we've got to continue to invest and accelerate our digital performance. Michael's talked about the additional speed we've added. Rick's talked about the additional benefits we're adding to Target Circle 360. Those are fundamental.\nWe've got to continue to make sure we're investing and growing our retail media business, Target Plus, and embedding technology, Michael, in everything we do. So you know as I do, retail is a world of fast followers. We've got to continue to set the pace. MOs, key seasonal moments, those limited-time offers, the newness we can bring to our assortment, that's what separates Target from our competition. But each and every day, we've got to be reliable. We've got to be consistent. We've got to make it easy and exciting for our guests to shop. And those are the things we wake up every day focused on.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target\n\nI mean, we know that when we deliver the Target magic, the consumer responds. If you think about this past quarter, we competed in 35 categories. Of those 35 categories, we gained or held share in 15. So we aim our goal is to do better than that, is to hold or gain share in the majority. But we did hold and gain in 15 categories that cut across both everyday categories like beverages, produce, floral, but also discretionary categories like women's swim, performance, toddler apparel. The common theme is when we deliver newness at a great value, we see strong performance. So I'll give you some examples that we're really excited about. In our home business, we launched Parachute, which is a DTC brand, a more premium brand. It is doing really well. We just launched new fabric, new colors, new prints in Parachute.\nIt's also doing well. We launched Disney and Marvel collections for Pillowfort. And again, very positive response from the consumer. So when we can continue to deliver that on-trend, style-forward product at an affordable price, we see the consumer respond, even in some of these discretionary categories which are challenged. So that's what we're going to be leaning into and doing more. And I'll give you one more example because it's a favorite one of mine. Just in time for Mother's Day, we launched Good Little Garden, which is a floral brand. And the business took off, double-digit growth, $6 bouquets. And we're seeing double-digit growth, and it's continuing well beyond Mother's Day. And that's what we just have to continue to do more of, is bring that Target magic.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target\n\nMaybe just to add one more thought there. You heard Brian use the word pace. And just to connect to the acceleration office that we're standing up, the word acceleration is quite intentionally picked. You can hear what powers the strategy, the newness Rick talked about, the fundamentals that Brian and I have talked about. We've got a strategy that's built for growth. We need to move down that path faster and with more pace. And so the work that we'll be doing with the acceleration office and more to come as we get into that work will be about streamlining how we operate and fast-tracking critical work in areas like technology that'll help us accelerate with pace down that strategy.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nMichael, I'll finish with a point that you've heard Rick talk about before, you've heard Cara Sylvester talk about. And I do think it's one of the things that drives differentiation at Target and always has. And it is that magic mix of great national brands, our very unique own brand portfolio that now exceeds $31 billion, and the fact that we're a destination for those emerging brands that our guests love to discover at Target. Those are areas we'll always lean into. But that magic mix of our national brands, our unique own brands with many billion-dollar brands in our portfolio, and the fact that we're a destination for those new discovery brands, those are things we've got to constantly be focusing on because that's what separates Target from so many of our competitors.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nUnderstood. If I could just add one quick follow-up question. The big debate on the heels of your result this morning is whether Target properly de-risked the outlook for the remainder of the year. It seems like the message is we just straight-lined what happened in the first quarter to the rest of the year. But the environment may not be as favorable as it was in the rest of the year. And there may be more investment necessary over the next couple of quarters. So how would you frame the downside or at least the potential that the guidance has sufficiently been de-risked? Thank you very much.\n\nJim Lee\n\nCFO, Target\n\nMichael, it's Jim here. Yeah, I think you framed it up correct. As we look at the balance of the year, we have taken a cautious outlook for our sales outlook as we look at low single-digit declines for balance of the year. But the headwinds or, sorry, the tailwinds we're seeing from shrink and productivity and what we'll expect to see from the Enterprise Acceleration Office and just moving faster is going to give us the oxygen to ensure that we continue to invest behind our brands and invest in our capital priorities as well.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nOperator, we have time for one last question this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on guidance and tariffs. I just want to make sure that we're clear on what's in the guidance. Are you saying that $7 to $9 includes the 30% tariff on China, that most of the offset can take place without pricing, and that your confidence in hitting that target, that guidance is very high? I think what we're trying to do is just make sure we properly understand and assess the risk related to pricing, elasticities, and any potential markdowns if you need to take greater pricing action.\n\n[Company Representative] (Target)\n\nCompany Representative, Target\n\nAnd it's a broad-based question, but I'll start, and then Jim can certainly add some additional color. As we sit here today, we have been certainly contemplating the impact of tariffs on our business. And the current tariff rates are built into the scenarios we've been working with. We've been looking about inventory management over the balance of the year, how we'll play pricing and promotion. That's all bundled into our current guidance. And I think we've taken a very conservative approach as we think about inventory management, how we're going to price and promote in this environment. But obviously, there's still lots of uncertainty. But the wide range of our guidance for the full year, I think, gives us the flexibility to make sure that we can take the actions that are built into our plan.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nAnd to build on that, the range of $7 to $9 includes both uncertainty around consumer confidence and on discretionary in particular, and potential impacts from tariffs. We have been playing, as Rick mentioned in detail, we've been ensuring we're really agile and flexible across a range of scenarios on tariffs. And we feel pretty comfortable that we can mitigate the vast majority of those impacts across sort of a wide range of those outcomes.\n\n[Company Representative] (Target)\n\nCompany Representative, Target\n\nAll right. Operator, that concludes our Q1 call. I appreciate everyone joining us today. We look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nGoodbye.",

I want to start by thanking all of you for spending some time with us today. Brian will kick off in a minute, but first I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Second, in today's remarks we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share, reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations, and SEC filings which are posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to get things started.\nHave got no husband, no baby, and some free time. So let's go to Target. Singing I'm in the store. Put it in my little basket that someone turns into a phone cart. Don't judge me. One of the best lessons to me this holiday season is Target pickup. Target has so many amazing things right now. Christmas section is fully stocked. The good deal did not stop there. Unboxed this designer look for less with me. It is nearly identical but a fraction of the cost. Things started off strong as soon as I walked in, and I also grabbed these shoes which are absolutely gorgeous. Target Valentine's Day line this year is so cute. Let me show you what I got. They just released a ton of new arrivals for spring. I'm going to show you guys a few of my favorites. Look at the skirt I got there. Look at the sweatshirt. You can go to Target, buy amazing stuff at affordable prices. These are great when you are doing games for social skills. This and that, this and that.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone and thanks for being here today. As we put together this morning's presentation, we thought carefully about the themes we've been hearing from investors so we can directly address what's on your mind. As we walk through progress to date and plans to come, you'll hear us answer three important questions. First, what is Target's unique place in retail? Second, how will Target build more engagement with even more consumers? And finally, how will we translate that engagement to more traffic, sales, and profitability over the next five years?\nWe believe the answer to those questions lie in the distinct role Target plays in consumers' lives. We're not like other retailers, which is precisely what consumers have told us they value about Target. We're the place they go to discover on-trend affordable products that they can't find anywhere else. And this year, that translated to 350 million more guest trips compared to 2019 or, the place they know will be a welcome break in their day. Whether they're strolling the aisles or scrolling their feed, this is how we've grown by nearly $30 billion in the span of five years. And in a world where shopping has become less inspiring, consumers expect us to be the place they can recapture the joy of retail. Which is why we expect to invest $4 to 5 billion in stores, supply chain, and technology this year.\nIn a world where we operate today, our guests are looking for Tarzhay. Consumers coined that term decades ago to define how we elevate the everything every day to something special, how we add unexpected fun into shopping that would be otherwise routine. And across categories and platforms, we stay true to that Tarzhay spirit by helping guests check off the essentials while discovering what's new and exciting. Target has always believed that shopping should be more than transactional. It should be an inviting experience that encourages people to stay, browse, discover, and buy, while making it easy for those looking to quickly get what they want and get on with their day. We remain anchored in the vision of what shopping should be, but we're not beholden to what we've achieved in that vision in the past.\nIn fact, we're leveraging the strengths we've gained from decades of growth and making changes in how we operate to carry forward the magic of Tarzhay for today's consumer. In doing so, we're blazing a trail for long-term growth. Our expectation is to drive more than $15 billion in revenue growth over the next five years. To get there, we have to hold a gross share across the majority of our categories. With most of our categories, we've seen very positive momentum in this regard. We had an outstanding year in beauty, which saw nearly 7% sales growth and share gains.\nApparel too grew share over the last three quarters, and over the holiday season we gained share in home in areas of hard lines like books and toys. Those tailwinds give us confidence in the year ahead in the overall long-term trajectory of our business. At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on near term sales trends. The sales decline in February we reported this morning reflects a mix of factors. Consumers continue to show a willingness to splurge on newness. We saw this play out around Valentine's Day when we saw record high sales. Yet, as we've discussed before, persistent economic uncertainty has consumers taking a conscious approach to spending, particularly in discretionary categories.\nDespite these near-term challenges, we are investing in multiple ways to hold and grow, share across our merchandising portfolio and reach our goal of more than $15 billion of growth in the years to come. New stores and remodels, supply chain enhancements, digital capabilities, newness across our assortment, partnerships with well-loved brands, momentum and loyalty, same-day delivery, our media business, and more. Today you'll hear about the investments we're making across the business to manage known environmental risks and lean into strengths in areas we can firmly control.\nThis roadmap for growth begins with today's Tarzhay, which lives at the intersection of product and experience and delivers everyday discovery and delight. Let's start with product. From the staples that serve as affordable basket builders to those unexpected finds that keep guests coming back to see what's new. Target's standout blend of brands and categories is well known. That strategic mix of products. What makes our assortment different? It's a key factor in driving traffic in our stores and online. That's why we continue to believe in the power of our discretionary categories to give consumers even more reasons to choose Target. You'll hear more from Rick on this today. But as merchants, we're focused on listening to consumers and keeping a pulse on what's relevant and trending. And we not only adapt to trends, we make them. Our own. Target's ties to fashion, entertainment, sports culture.\nThey run deep, enabling us to deliver an assortment and the experiences that raise the bar on what it means to delight consumers. Now, nothing better exemplifies this than our Taylor Swift exclusives. The record-breaking event made Black Friday buzzworthy again. Guests lined up outside our stores and drove huge online demand. That made the Eras Tour book the highest selling music book of all time with nearly 1 million units sold in the first week alone. As much fun as it was to see the crowds and deliver this one-of-a-kind experience for our guests, we're not content with one big moment per year. We have a steady stream of newness that flows into our assortment. So guests always have something to discover as they shop.\nIn January alone, when millions of guests were looking to jumpstart their 2025 routines, we introduced 2,000 new wellness products, 600 of which can be found only at Target, representing a mix of own brands, national brands, and emerging brands. Here are just a few examples. Blogilates for Target, an exclusive activewear collection developed with social media influencer Cassey Ho, or BERO, the new non-alcoholic beer brand co-founded by actor Tom Holland. We added new items to our own brand, Auden, and introduced Peloton apparel to our Target Plus marketplace. That last mention is important because it reflects the steady expansion of our Target Plus portfolio to include products from more than 1,500 trusted partners. Target Plus is a great example of how we're taking a fresh look at areas of our business where we believe are ripe for growth.\nBy ramping up our investment last year, we've grown Target Plus to a $1 billion marketplace that's growing at a double-digit pace. We're doing it in a way that's true to Target, giving consumers more choice within the broader umbrella of the trusted Target brand. No compromise in quality or experience, just more Target for guests to enjoy. The investment and stewardship we extend to Target Plus applies to the full scope of Target's guest experiences. We have always been students of design and focus on the elements that make for a standout shopping experience. Quality, selection, presentation, and service. That's why you'll hear how we're investing in stores, supply chain, and digital to elevate the total guest experience.\nOur stores have always been a consistent investment priority for years because they serve a dual role as shopping destinations and fulfillment hubs. Those investments have contributed to traffic gains and double-digit growth in services like Drive Up and same-day delivery with Target Circle 360. Now we're focused on making our stores hub model work even harder. In 2025, our level of investment in stores will accelerate as we open more than 20 new stores and remodel many more across the chain, and behind the scenes, we'll continue to bring our supply chain and stores closer together, using our proximity to guests to move inventory with more speed, efficiency, and flexibility than ever before. In tandem with our investments in physical shopping spaces are the investments we're making in our digital experience.\nThink socially inspired and AI enhanced. Target's digital ecosystem is all about anticipating consumer preferences and making the path to purchase easy and fun. Our digital investment is always on and you'll see us pushing even further into creating an immersive experience using search, social, and data-driven personalization. This gives consumers even more ways to discover the magic of our assortment and engage with our brand. One of the very best representations of how we tailor our experience to the needs of our guests is Target Circle. When we launched our reimagined loyalty program last year, we started from a place of consumer feedback. What do they love about shopping at Target? What could we do better?\nWhat would build stronger connections with our brand? The result was a refreshed, free-to-join program open to all, customized with benefits that match how consumers like to shop. We started 2024 with one of the nation's leading loyalty programs and added 13 million members over the course of the year. Many of those members layered on extra benefits like our Target Circle Card, which offers an extra 5% savings every day, and Target Circle 360, that offers same-day delivery services as part of an annual subscription.\nWe're thrilled with the energy and engagement we've seen so far, and you'll hear from others. Target Circle is a critical lever for delivering a more personalized experience for our guests. As membership grows, we gather more insights about how guests prefer to save and shop with us. We apply those learnings to everything from marketing and digital design to assortment decisions and operational improvements. It's how we'll drive relevance and even deeper loyalty. You'll see this come to life through our in-house media company Roundel. Delivering nearly $2 billion in value last year, Roundel continues to generate significant profitable growth. Advertisers and vendors consistently cite the ease with which we are able to deliver creative campaigns that provide a strong return on investment.\nWith recent changes that bring Roundel and our social commerce teams closer together, we see the potential to double the size of our media business over the next five years. Accompany these investments and our team's commitment to deliver retail fundamentals that make or break how guests experience Target. We know when items are out of stock, or shipments are late, or lines are long. We disappoint shoppers and sacrifice sales. You'll hear today how we're making progress in these areas so we can reliably serve our guests.\nReliability is a theme you'll hear throughout today's presentation. Reliably in stock so shoppers can count on us for everything they need. Reliably easy so shopping is more fun and less of a burden. Reliably affordable so we're fully embracing our expect more, pay less promise and reliably Target with newness and selection you can't find anywhere else. In every aspect of our business, we're investing and evolving to deliver a reliable, joyful experience to our guests.\nToday's Tarzhay is fueled by a differentiated strategy that leans in delivering everyday discovery and delight and speaks directly to consumers' preferences and areas of growth potential. Our investments to execute with more speed, efficiency, and reliability. It's why we're so confident in Target's future growth and profitability. So now it's my turn to turn it over to the team to provide more details. So Michael, over to you.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, thanks Brian. I'm happy to take the baton and share a bit more about how we create the discovery and delight behind today's Tarzhay. And make no mistake, at the heart of that magic is incredible, on-trend, affordable product. That combination of newness and style that we deliver through our assortment makes us who we are. It's our own brands that you can only find at Target. It's our well-loved assortment of national brand partners, both big established brands and those smaller emerging brands. And it's those key limited-time partnerships that you'll find online and in our stores.\nThere are some forever truths in retail. One of them, retail is about product. The best product at the best value wins. When you can find that fantastic combination of newness, style, and value at Target, we win. There's a second retail truth. Experience is critical. In operations, we're focused on how we bring those products to life, how we help our guests discover them in an elevated and easy way. That's uniquely Target. We know that today consumers increasingly shop digitally. That's why we've invested in a powerful digital experience to help them find product more often than not in the palm of their hand, and social, and on our app, positioning Target to win in a world where the consumer purchase funnel is changing. It's working.\nWe have a $20 billion digital business that's hitting on all cylinders with nearly 9% growth in Q4. But at Target, we couple digital strength with a strong belief that the brick and mortar experience matters. A differentiated in store experience that's powered by our incredible team is critical to bringing product and discovery to life for our guests. It's that seamless combination of that elevated discovery experience across stores and digital that'll power the more than $15 billion of growth that Brian shared we expect in the next five years.\nAnd so in the next 15 minutes, I'll explore some of the ways we're delighting consumers with an on-trend assortment: how we're making it even easier for them to discover those great products whenever and however they want. And then how we're delivering ease, speed, and reliability for a consumer whose expectations continue to rise. So let's start by taking a look at the retail landscape. What we see is an addressable market that's huge. Even as a $100 billion retailer, we make up less than 3% of a $4.2 trillion market. In fact, together with the other nine biggest retailers, we make up less than 40% of that market. What's that tell us? There's a lot of market share up for grabs, and we're well positioned to continue to grow our share of the pie on the strength of a strategy that's uniquely ours.\nI'll go back to my opening remarks to highlight our first area of focus on our path to growth, delighting consumers with on-trend assortment packed with style, newness, and value. One of my favorite examples is our All In Motion line of activewear. It's become a staple for all five members of the Fiddelke household because it's comfortable, fashionable, and performs well at a fraction of the cost of the other brands. Now maybe this is just the inherent finance guy in me, but before my two daughters fell in love with All In Motion, I'd wince at the cost of an athleisure outfit for them. Those leggings cost how much and they're gonna fit you for how long? But now they specifically ask for All In Motion over those more expensive brands, which I have to say is a proud dad moment for me.\nAnd a lot of guests have responded to the quality and value with the same enthusiasm. All in Motion is more than a $1 billion brand and grew over 10% in 2024. It's only at Target, of course, part of a long list of exclusive brands that consumers love. Combined with our well-loved national brands and the way our team leans into seasonal moments and special partnerships, we have a team who makes moments memorable and turns products into must-haves, and that's a winning formula for relevance and growth. You'll hear more from Rick on this shortly.\nSo regardless of how guests come across those got-to-have-it items as part of their discovery process, whether browsing our store while sipping a Starbucks, scrolling our app over Saturday morning coffee, or clicking to buy via social from their couch, camp chair, or anywhere in between, we're making it easier for them to shop whenever and however they want through an elevated experience that only Target can deliver. That discovery experience is our second area of focus as we work to earn an even greater share of the market opportunity I laid out at the top. We're investing in stores to bring the best of Target closer to more consumers, making it even easier for them to fall in love with our products and experience and to visit Target more frequently. Three out of four Americans live within 10mi of a Target store.\nWe call that a good base on which to build. Last year we shared plans to add 300 stores over 10 years, and we feel great about the fact that in 2024 we opened 23 of those new stores and plan to open another 20 this year, while remodeling many more across the country. Increasingly, these new locations will be full-size Targets, giving us the space and flexibility to offer the very best Target experience. Consumers are overjoyed to have these stores in their backyards, as we see in our new store performance metrics, and we continue to gain traction with consumers as a destination for discovery. You can see that traction in our 2% plus traffic growth in Q4 and our 20% uptick in traffic since 2019, numbers that translate into 350 million more guest trips to Target in 2024 than 2019. Let me say that again, 350 million more guest trips. While we're not satisfied with our growth over the last two years, rising traffic clearly demonstrates the power of our strategy to drive continued relevance and growth over time.\nIn adding stores, we're not just making it easier to discover and take advantage of the Target store experience, but we're adding horsepower to the engine for our digital business because our stores are the fulfillment power plant behind Drive Up, same-day delivery via Target Circle 360, and fast brown box shipping for those times when a guest shopping mission isn't an in-store trip. That interplay between stores and digital is critically important to our strategy. As Cara will discuss in a bit, they aren't separate businesses, they're the business. When we make it easy for guests to shop digitally, to swing by our Drive Up lane on the way home from soccer practice, or schedule doorstep delivery via Target Circle 360, guests repay that ease and convenience by spending a lot more at Target, 20+% more after they start using Drive Up or same-day delivery. Perhaps surprisingly, those guests spend more in store as well.\nSo our third area of focus on our roadmap for growth underpins the others we have to deliver. We come at this challenge from an enviable position. Guests love our stores, an assortment full of newness and value, an elevated shopping experience. That's a key reason why consumer consumers pick Target, and at the heart of it, the best team in retail. Our team's crushing it with real progress made in 2024. But as we assess where we're at, we know two things can be true. We start with a great guest experience, and we aren't where we aspire to be. In a world where consumer expectations continue to rise, we have to deliver at even higher levels on things like ease, speed, and reliable in stocks.\nWe know there's no Tarzhay magic if you can't find the item you were looking for because we were out of stock or we didn't delight you. In-store inventory reliability is an area where we've made considerable progress. In fact, our out of stocks were lower in every quarter of last year than the year before, and the year before that. But we're not settling for progress. We're confident that we will continue to improve in 2025 and beyond. Along with Chief Supply Chain and Logistics Officer Gretchen McCarthy and her team, we have a lot of work in flight to support this goal, and I'll highlight a few of the key elements.\nFirst, we're changing how we measure success to give us an even better read on exactly how we're performing. To illustrate what I mean, the graph I just showed highlights very real improvement for us on average for the enterprise. But if you're a guest shopping on Sunday night who discovers that we're out of stock on the item you came to get, you don't care about the enterprise average. You just want to know why we don't have your milk. And so we've rolled out a new suite of measures to help us get more granular in our assessment of our in-stock performance. These metrics tell us, with greater precision than ever, by channel and by hour how we're actually showing up for our guests.\nWe're doubling down on this work with a focus on the items that matter most, think the thousands of items that are most frequently purchased, where it's most critical that we're at the top of our game in every store on every day, open to close. We have the entire enterprise rallied around this work, including implementing changes like designing our merchandising displays to have more capacity for those critical items. Now I want to pause here for a moment to offer a bit of context regarding our inventory levels at the end of the year. Q4 ending inventory at cost was up a little over 7% to last year due to several factors. First, we pulled forward receipts to introduce greater newness in key categories like apparel and hard lines. Second, we added two new food distribution centers and made some intentional investments to improve product availability, as you just heard me share. And third, we also saw some receipt timing volatility. We'll continue to monitor our inventory levels closely, always with an eye to having the right assortment at the right time.\nAnd again, this is why we're focused on shorter lead times. Because shorter lead times not only help us reduce inventory risk, they also help keep us in step with the latest trends, something I know Rick will talk more about. As part of our work to improve our end-to-end replenishment execution, we're also midstream on a multi-year journey to modernize with tools powered by AI our core inventory management systems. These are the tools that enable more accurate forecasting, help us better position inventory to drive in-stock speed, and reduce costs. These new systems are now used by about 40% of the assortment. That's more than double the percentage that used them in 2023. Progress we expect to continue in 2025 and beyond.\nOf course, that's only one ingredient in an exceptional guest experience. Delivering an elevated store experience is another, and that's a place where we have momentum on which to build. Take our guest's experience at checkout. We've invested in more staffing in our belted checkout lanes and made changes to speed up the self-checkout process, and our guests are telling us it's working. I'll highlight one of many examples. Our guest satisfaction for speed of checkout has risen to its highest level in more than three years. We know how hard it is to move those numbers and couldn't be prouder of our team's progress. But, and I'll say it again, our aspirations don't end there. Let's take a closer look at that graph here.\nAgain, these measures of progress represent averages and that means in some stores on some days we're truly delighting our guests, while in other stores on other days we can be falling short of expectations. That's why in 2025 you'll see me and our new Chief Stores Officer Adrienne Costanzo focused on this progress to help our team deliver a more consistently excellent guest experience. Now, we know we won't be perfect in every store at every hour of every day, but I know I speak for Adrian when I say we aspire to be, and I'm confident will build on this momentum with another step forward in 2025.\nWe're at our best when process improvements like those we've seen at checkout give our team time to add that extra personal touch through interactions with our guests. After all, our team is the best expression of our brand and when we make it easier for them to prioritize time with our guests, it leads to higher guest satisfaction and loyalty. And speaking of loyalty, our team members were instrumental in helping attract 13 million new Target Circle members in 2024. In the words of California Store Director Andy Fung, whose store was a standout in signing up new Target Circle members, it's all about demonstrating care and making connections with guests. I love that Andy. And knowing a great guest experience starts with a great team member experience, we continue to make investments in our team that allow them to show up even better for our guests, including technology advancements aimed at improving the team member and guest experience, from the Gen AI powered Store Companion used to answer hundreds of thousands of questions last year to advancements that make our self checkout lanes easier for visually impaired guests to navigate.\nAnd while we of course love that in-store trip and will continue to invest in elevating the store experience, sometimes a store trip isn't in the cards. For a busy family, the mission of the moment is all about speed and ease. For us, speed starts with our same-day shopping options. There's nothing faster than Drive Up or same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360, both of which meet guest needs within a few hours. Guests love these services, something that shows in their continued growth and sky-high net promoter scores. And if you need a box shipped to your home, we've got you covered too. Brown-box shipping is specifically a place within our supply chain where we're making meaningful progress on speed and where we expect more to come.\nWe're over 11% faster in average delivery time in 2024, nearly doubling our packages delivered next day over last year, a key factor in driving the healthy growth in total shipped package volume which has more than doubled since 2019. We know speed matters to our guests and that with increased speed comes more sales. We've shared how sortation centers have helped us drive speed and efficiency and we expect them to continue to grow volume while making us faster and less expensive. But we also plan to speed up delivery to guests that don't happen to have a sortation center in their backyard in 2024. We've been testing how to leverage our Shipt capabilities to enable store to guest brown box delivery in markets without sortation centers by allowing drivers with Shipt to work delivery routes handed off directly from stores.\nWhile we're in the early stages of expanding this test to more markets, we're very encouraged by the early results as it's making us faster and more cost efficient. It's yet another example of the power of our stores as hubs strategy coupled with the delivery powered by shoppers and drivers with Shipt, and it's one of the many reasons we're excited about our work across our network to speed up package delivery in 2025 and beyond. As you can see, we plan to accelerate this year in more ways than one, and I want to thank our more than 400,000 incredible team members who bring this experience to life every day for our guests and whose focus and dedication continues to raise the bar on guest experience.\nYou've heard a lot from me today, so I'll leave you with what's most important and I'll do that by going back to those 350 million guest trips. What do those guest visits tell us? They demonstrate the power of our strategy. The 350 million more guest trips last year than in 2019 show how our strategy continues to gain relevance and how it will power our next $15 billion in growth. We're clear-eyed about our strategy and what it will take to realize those expectations. It starts with delighting consumers with incredible product. We then bring that incredible product to life with an elevated discovery experience that for us is equal parts digital, in store.\nAs you might expect the COO to say, the fundamentals matter. All that strategy is just words on a page. If we aren't delivering a great shopping experience every day, you're going to see us make progress in our inventory reliability and modernize our core supply chain while reducing lead times; you'll see us bring greater consistency to our store experience and continue to improve our package delivery speed. I'm confident in our ability to deliver on that progress, to be faster, more reliable, and more consistent than before in 2025 and in the years to come as we continue to elevate the discovery and delight behind today's Tarzhay. It's my pleasure now to introduce Rick who will take you deeper into the product and merchandising piece of the strategy. Rick.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Michael. I'm excited to be here and to share a glimpse into what's coming at Target. It's all grounded in an idea you've heard this morning. Everyday discovery and delight, which is at the heart of today's Tarzhay. For consumers, Tarzhay is a term they created, a statement of love for this brand and the unique spin we put on the intersection of product experience. For our team, delivering today's Tarzhay is a responsibility. In our discretionary categories, Home, Apparel, Hardlines. In our frequency categories, Food and Beverage, and Essentials, and in Beauty, which sits at the intersection of frequency and discretionary. Because there's not one entry point into the Target experience, there are six and countless paths to reach them.\nWhich means our team is relentless in looking for ways to spur discovery and make every shopping trip special through a combination of creativity and being at the forefront of style and trend. Because ease, affordability, and reliability are things we must achieve to stay relevant. But to truly win, we have to chart a course that is distinctly Target. So across our business, six categories that don't necessarily have a lot in common actually serve the same purpose for us, creating the kind of everyday discovery and delight that sets Target apart.\nOur commitment to the consumer and to differentiation in a competitive environment comes through in each of the three components of our assortment strategy that includes national brands that consumers love and a $31 billion owned brand portfolio. More than 40 beloved brands you can only find at Target, roughly one quarter of which are delivering at least a billion dollars a year in sales. Like Cat & Jack, one of the top kids apparel brands in America. Threshold, Good & Gather, and up&up, all of which are approaching or exceeding $3 billion in annual sales. Then there's our special partnerships with national brands and world famous designers as well as small independent brands that consumers love discovering at Target. There's a lot of power for us in this mix, but we know we can't stand still. We have to earn every trip.\nWe grew traffic in stores and digital last year, and we're committed to building on that. That means as we look across our business, we're having honest conversations about where we need to make investments, build capabilities, and deliver improved performance. And exciting conversations about how we can leverage our signature strengths to set Target apart now. We've grown our food and beverage essentials and beauty categories by nearly $20 billion since 2019, making Target the fifth largest frequency player in US retail. And as we look to drive these businesses forward, we're focused on two key priorities. The first is continued improvement in reliability, particularly within food and beverage. This is a business that's grown by almost $9 billion over the last five years. And during that time, Target has become the fifth biggest digital grocer in America.\nSo to keep up with a surge in demand, we've opened three new food distribution centers over the last two years, expanding our network to eight facilities nationwide. We have another one opening in 2026. While we've made big strides with in stocks, we know that high in stocks on average are only part of the equation. There's still an important opportunity for us during peak shopping periods, including Sunday afternoon and weekday evenings, because these are times where being out of stock on a key item can cost sales on related items or even the entire trip. Across our frequency businesses and beauty, we're focused on delivering the kind of consistent newness that has helped transform these categories.\nThat'll be led by our flagship food and beverage owned brand, Good & Gather, which is one of the biggest and fastest growing grocery owned brands in the US and on the brink of becoming Target's first $4 billion owned brand. This year we'll add 600 new items across Good & Gather and our powerhouse snack and dessert brand Favorite Day. To put that in perspective, for many CPG brands, a dozen new items represent a big year. But for our food and beverage team, that's what we'll average in one week. I am proud to share that. Today we're bringing the design style partnerships that Target is known for to food and beverage through a series of Good & Gather collaborations, the first with James Beard Award-winning Chef Ann Kim. It's at almost 1,800 stores nationwide.\nNext week, starting at just under $7, we'll have seven items from Chef Ann with flavors representing her Korean heritage, including four frozen pizzas in styles that she's made famous in her Minneapolis restaurant, Pizzeria Lola. This is another example of delivering everyday discovery and delight in our grocery aisles. A big step forward in our journey to make Target a retailer that doesn't just sell food, but celebrates food, and within Essentials, we've seen how taking a fresh look at a legacy brand can make a big difference for consumers. Last year we relaunched up&up, reformulating about 40% of the assortment to make it even better for consumers and adding hundreds of new items that we knew guests wanted.\nToday, with more than 2,000 items, up&up is closing in on becoming a $3 billion brand, part of an everyday essentials assortment that also includes Dealworthy, a lowest priced brand we launched last year that spans several categories, store-wide, and Everspring. Our elevated sustainable offering, new brands, and brand refreshes are a key tool for helping us meet consumer needs. Which is why our relaunch of Boots & Barkley, our pet accessories brand, is so exciting. Pet care is a big growth opportunity. New product just set in stores on Sunday, and it's everything an animal lover could want.\nWe'll continue delivering newness across essentials, adding 14 new brands in nutrition this spring to build on consumers' interest in wellness and more than 2,200 new baby and toddler items, 50% of which will be exclusive to Target, including 200 new items from our baby-owned brand Cloud Island. Now we've nearly doubled the size of our beauty business since 2019. Amazing in-store presentation and a great digital experience. Our partnership with Ulta Beauty and our assortment that includes some of the leading brands in the industry have combined to make Target an undisputed beauty destination, and we are not resting on our laurels. That's why we just announced the addition of 2,000 new products to our assortment. 90% of which will be priced under $20. That includes an expansion in our offering and brands like EOS, NYX, Native, Alodia, Camille Rose, and the addition of nearly 50 new brands like Bubble and DAISE, plus more newness within Ulta Beauty at Target to further cement Target's status as a go-to for all things beauty.\nNow, when we consider our discretionary categories hardlines, home and apparel. These are the businesses that made Target famous, and while there's no denying after massive growth during the pandemic they've been challenged in recent years, they're still generating more than $50 billion in sales. They're a huge part of what differentiates Target, and we saw meaningful acceleration across our discretionary portfolio in Q4.T o turn that acceleration into sustained growth, there are three big opportunities in front of us. First, we're being bold in transforming our hardlines and home businesses based on consumer insights and changing trends. Second, we're making changes to get faster, cutting the time it takes to move products from sketchpad to factory to a consumer's basket. And finally, we're moving with a sense of urgency to deliver the kind of compelling newness that makes Target a place for discovery, delight, and joy.\nWhen it comes to being bold. I love how our Hardlines team is embracing the spirit of what they're calling Fun 101 as they reimagine what this business can do for consumers. Words matter, and what Fun 101 is all about is realizing the untapped potential of a category that includes toys, video games, music, and books, sporting goods, and technology. We have significant strengths in businesses like toys and video games, and nobody does pop culture better than Target. At the same time, we're excited about the growing opportunity in sports and entertainment and lifestyle tech. By putting all of this together, we will transform our Hardlines business and make Target a year-round destination for everything you need to create fun moments for yourself and your loved ones.\nUltimately, this will impact how we show up in store and online, and it's already having an impact on our approach to product. Just consider a few examples like how we're making Target a go-to for big moments in culture. You saw that on Black Friday with a huge Taylor Swift release that Brian mentioned. We were one of the top retailers for Wicked with 60% of our Wicked assortment exclusive to Target. In January, Target was the place to be for the launch of Rebecca Yarros's latest book, Onyx Storm. Books are so important to the families we serve and I love how our team has responded. We're gaining share because we've made Target a destination for the top titles and that work paid off.\nWith Onyx Storm, we were the number one retailer on its release date with a 30% share en route to blowing past all of our goals for the launch. We're also betting big on emerging brands like the Next Gaming Cube, a system that's great for the entire family, including children who aren't ready for the more advanced controllers. By partnering early with Nex before they really took off in the fall, we had the inventory needed to support a surge in demand in November and in December. And we're also leaning into sports, particularly in getting children ready for their first sport, building on the role we play for families in other areas of our assortment. That's a small sample of what fun 101 means, and I love how it's distinctly Target. It has so much potential to grow this entire business.\nIn home we have been on a journey, and as you know, this is an industry that's been challenged over recent years, but we are not using that as an excuse. We must do better, and we believe Target can be the destination for great home style to help create spaces and moments families will love. So we're building a channel strategy for home that gives consumers the range of choice they want along with the joy that comes with shopping at Target. That starts with doubling down on Target's legacy when it comes to style, design, and affordability.\nSo through our design capabilities, we are focusing on the brands and products where we have seen Target make the biggest difference for consumers, helping them layer in thoughtful trend-forward updates over time, like Threshold and Hearth & Hand with Magnolia, beloved brands that are part of millions of homes across the US. We are also incredibly excited about what we've seen since relaunching our Casaluna bedding brand this year. With new prints, patterns, and bamboo materials, the product is beautiful, and great design is also driving improved performance.\nOver the last couple of months of the year, Casaluna sales were up nearly 6%, and over the last two years our new kitchenware brand Figment has become a guest favorite thanks to incredible style and can't-miss pricing. It is competing directly against some of the biggest players in the industry. We're also committed to being first to mass like we've done with great brands like Stanley and Nespresso, and influential designers like Shea McGee. We're going big on seasons, holidays, and the role we play in major life moments like Back-to-College where we'll deliver even more of the newness and elevated experiences that separate Target.\nAt the same time, we continue to expand our third-party marketplace, Target Plus, which is contributing to the acceleration of home and represents a significant opportunity to grow this business. What sets Target Plus apart from other marketplaces is that it's consumer led. Rather than opening the doors to any seller, we're focused on building relevance and trust by working with partners that complement our assortment and also help us provide more of the breadth consumers are looking for, ensuring we're strong option in categories where we wouldn't otherwise have a big presence that includes great brands like Dupray and Modern Lux. And there's a lot more potential for Target Plus to grow our home business while freeing up our teams to focus on creating the kind of Tarzhay experience consumers can't find anywhere else.\nNow I want to talk a little bit about our apparel business. Comp sales and apparel were up by more than 3% in the fourth quarter, and driving share gains across almost all demographic groups, including families and those making more than $100,000 a year. A lot has gone into this, but I am especially proud of what our team is doing when it comes to increasing our speed to market. This helps ensure consumers can find what they want when they want it. We saw that last year when the Mob Wives leopard print aesthetic took off on TikTok, loosely inspired by the 25th anniversary of The Sopranos. Within days we were able to work with our vendors to get product available online, and within weeks we had product in store.\nIn today's environment, this kind of speed goes hand in hand with being a discovery destination and driving some of the experience enhancements you'll hear about from Cara. In our own brands, our team can get product from design to a shopper's basket in a little less than eight weeks on our fastest calendar. Speed is about more than just strengthening our ability to jump on the latest trend of what's going viral right now. By reducing our product development calendar by at least 20% across our entire assortment, particularly in home and apparel, we're adding in speed and flexibility. That gives us more time to react to changes in the market and changes in consumer needs when it comes to newness, colors, and sizes.\nOur own brand sourcing and global supply planning teams do this by working closely with our vendor partners and strategically managing raw materials, production capacity, and lead times so we're getting the right items to our guests at the right time while still upholding the high expectations consumers have for Target. When it comes to quality, sustainability, and responsible sourcing, delivering on both speed and flexibility drives the kind of relevance that boosts top line and that kind of rigor and discipline also drives bottom line performance. A great example of this is the work on All in Motion. You already heard how Michael and his family love this brand and they are not alone. Consumers couldn't get enough of our everyday soft fabric and steady drumbeat of new silhouettes and styles in 2024.\nSo our team responded chasing into an additional eight million units, which helped All in Motion deliver a more than 10% comp sales increase last year. When we think about flexibility, that includes our country of production strategy for the products we directly source and the multi-year effort we've made to diversify countries of origin. Our primary focus is on delivering the quality products and competitive prices that our guests deserve. It's important to know that around half of what we sell is made in the US. In terms of our own brand production, we've reduced what we source from China from roughly 60% in 2017 to around 30% today, and on our way to less than 25% by the end of next year, a goal we expect to achieve four years ahead of our schedule.\nWe've been especially effective in our apparel production and just 17% penetration in China thanks to success in shifting production to countries across the globe. That includes a strong effort to move production to Western Hemisphere countries like Guatemala and Honduras, which has added the benefit of helping us get product from factories to US consumers even faster. So we're excited to continue pursuing opportunities in the Western Hemisphere across all own brand categories and in the US where possible.\nFinally, there is so much newness across discretionary like our new Pillowfort collections featuring Disney and Marvel setting in stores in the spring. Or the way our Goodfellow menswear team is moving from rolling out new items in February and September to launching new on trend items almost monthly. Or the exciting Warby Parker partnership we just announced with shop-in-shops that will begin opening in the back half of the year.\nI can't underscore enough how just excited the entire Target team is about our upcoming partnership with Champion. Because when you combine Champion's legacy in sportswear with Target style authority, the result is amazing. This multi-year partnership will begin setting in stores in August and will include a lifestyle collection featuring unique apparel, sporting goods, and bags. Ultimately this will bolster our style authority and complement our existing assortment of national brands and own brands. And most importantly, I know consumers will absolutely love it. So I want to extend a special thank you to Jamie Salter and everyone at Authentic Brands Group and Champion for all of your hard work in making this one-of-a-kind partnership possible.\nOkay, before I hand off to Cara, I want to reiterate that everything we do starts with listening to consumers, learning from what works and what doesn't, and making improvements every day. No matter why, when, or how you're shopping, it's easy, inspiring, and affordable. That's how we create everyday discovery and delight. And that's the thinking behind the phrase today's Tarzhay. Because winning in this retail environment is not about what we've done. It's about what we're creating every week, every quarter, every year to drive this business forward. I'm proud of the resiliency, consumer centricity, and creativity of our team and that they bring to everything that they're doing. I can't wait to see what they're going to come up with next to give more consumers more reasons to choose Target every day. Thank you. Now over to Cara.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. It is great to be back with you again to share our plans to continue building momentum in our business. As you heard earlier from Brian, we aspire to bring together the best of what consumers want in a shopping experience in a way that is uniquely Target. Many other retail experiences offer trade-offs. You can have a good value, but not the best shopping experience. You can have unlimited choices, but difficulty searching and feeling inspired. You can have quality, but at steep prices. Not with us. At Target, we don't believe in trade-offs. We believe in the power of and for our guests. You heard from Rick that consumers want on-trend quality products, and they want them at affordable prices. That's been part of our expect more, pay less DNA for decades.\nConsumers want convenience and a great shopping experience, whether you choose to shop in stores or online. We intentionally design an elevated experience to be Target, filled with discovery, inspiration, and ease. Consumers also want a compelling array of product choices, and they want to know that we stand behind each and every product that we sell. But we know it isn't just about what we sell; it's also so much about how we sell it. From TV ads, to how we show up on social platforms, to the way we design our stores, our website, and app, we know that experience is crucial, and we want to immerse consumers in a joyful and inspiring retail journey every time. After all, in addition to our on-trend design-forward products, Target also became famous for our aspirational in-store experience.\nIt's how we earn the moniker Tarzhay from our guests, and it's why they continue to hold us to the incredibly high standard that we also hold for ourselves. And those expectations, they aren't exclusive to our stores. Consumers not only want but expect Target to provide that same level of discovery and inspiration while scrolling our app as they get when strolling our physical aisles. So that's a key focus as we continue to take that Tarzhay feeling that guests have loved for decades and keep it fresh and relevant today by investing in capabilities to become America's favorite discovery destination. This approach uniquely blends physical and digital retail along with social in a way that only Target can. To us, it isn't just about a set of fulfillment options.\nDigital is the new front door to our experience, a way to come alongside our guests when they want and need us most. Sometimes that's providing mom the much needed inspiration on how to pull off that perfect yet affordable kid's birthday party. Just a few clicks and everything she needs is added to her cart for a Drive Up order, ready in a few hours. At other times, it's Target Circle 360 saving the day, helping dad with all he needs to make dinner tonight brought straight to his front door from one of Shipt's 300,000 shoppers nationwide. So while others may view digital as if it's a separate business, a profit headwind to overcome, or simply a way to sell ads, we view it first as another opportunity to do what we do best. Bring that Target magic to consumers.\nNow. This experience actually starts before they ever step foot through our physical or digital front door. It starts from their couch as they enjoy ads that are distinctly Target and drive the awareness and brand love that we've seen strive for. From the iconic Target lady to our easy on the eyes holiday team member Chris, who is lovingly referred to as Hot Santa on social, these campaigns, they're more than entertaining. They reinforce the love that consumers feel for our brand, helping keep Target top of mind long after the commercial ends. And it's working. For example, Target Santa stole the show across media outlets and this holiday season with more than 70 million social mentions, making it one of the top searches on TikTok the week of Black Friday.\nThrough cultural relevance and a style that is uniquely Target, we're creating an unmatched emotional bond with our guests that translates to traffic and sales growth. But these bonds, they only last if we consistently delight and inspire our guests. So over the last year, we've continued to invest in many enhancements and innovation with the spirit of continuing to do just that. First, we always want to get the fundamentals right. For example, we've been improving our AI-powered algorithms to enhance the logic behind our online product recommendations, our search functionality, and substitutions. And while guests may not even realize that we've made these changes, A/B testing has shown that these have already led to hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental sales.\nBut beyond the fundamentals, we're also always innovating, leaning in with a test and learn approach to design our digital experience to be truly distinctive. For proof, look no further than our industry-leading Drive Up service. We were one of the first retailers to offer Drive Up, and it didn't take long before it became one of the most beloved services that we offer. Even though this service has delivered consistently high growth and high Net Promoter Scores, that hasn't stopped us from innovating to make it even better, adding features like Starbucks, or returns right to your car. Recently we became the first retailer to integrate our app into Apple CarPlay, and of course the service is also available through Android Auto. Using these car-based technologies, guests can now let their local Target team know they're on their way to pick up their Drive Up order.\nThey can navigate hands free to the store and alert the team when they've arrived. The convenience, the ease, and the reliability of our digital experience has supported tremendous growth, with overall digital sales now representing about 20% of our total volume, and we're punching well above our weight in categories like food and beverage, helping with dinner tonight, or even just stocking the pantry without ever having to get out of your car. Car Drive Up and same day delivery have been game changers for so many of our guests and have helped propel us to be one of the nation's top five grocers, well ahead of many traditional grocery stores in the US. We're also innovating in support of product discovery and making changes that are more revolutionary, including how we're infusing GenAI technology and social media signals into our digital experience.\nWe've integrated the power of GenAI throughout our digital experience in many compelling ways, including summarizing guest product reviews to better help other guests make purchase decisions, enhancing content to make our product detail pages richer and more compelling, and building tools like our GenAI-powered Gift Finder that help guests find the perfect present for their loved ones over the holiday just by answering a few simple questions before arriving at our digital or physical front door. We know that social media plays an outsized role in today's shopping journey. Consumers seamlessly shift between discovering trends and making purchases, which means shopping is no longer a distinct transaction. It's an always-on experience woven into everyday browsing and social interactions. This provides countless opportunities to engage consumers in new ways and provides outsized potential for Target. Why?\nBecause of all big box retailers, Target is the most engaged with brand on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Number one. Social platforms are already among the fastest growing drivers of traffic to our digital platforms and with far greater engagement compared to our peers. We know there are massive opportunities ahead of us, and because we know where consumers are starting their shopping journey, we can use AI to identify emerging trends from these social platforms to more quickly amplify relevant products we carry. You heard the example from Rick on the Mob Wives trend that we saw a few months ago, and as this trend began to go viral on social platforms, we were able to quickly amplify all things Leopard print across our platforms right as it was trending, capitalizing on this cultural moment as it occurred rather than reading and reacting after the fact.\nAgain, it isn't about stores or digital or social. It's all of them working together. We're connecting our digital experiences with our already beloved store experience unlike anyone else. So we know that consumers, they don't just set their phones down when they shop in a physical store. In fact, more than 1/3 of guests with the Target app use it while shopping in our stores. This not only gives us additional ways to merge our in-store and digital shopping experience, it also leads to more opportunities to drive sales through compelling product recommendations and promotions. Why? Guests who use the Target app while in our stores already spend more per transaction, nearly 50% more in fact, with room to grow this further. So recently we rolled out new functionality that transforms your phone into a personal shopping assistant used to enhance the in-store experience. This functionality helps guests navigate within the store and allows them to easily find everything they're looking for through guided virtual pathing.\nSo no more guessing what aisle a product is in or even where that aisle is located. We can also recommend products that complement what you're searching or buying for. What makes me even more excited is not just what we are doing, but the endless possibilities of what we can do. Soon, we're currently developing ways to utilize the app to search current Target Circle offers, navigating Bargain Hunters to where in the store these deals can be found, or imagine a situation where knowing where you're located in our store, we can customize your app experience to tailor the content based on what you're currently browsing.\nFor example, if a guest is standing in one of our beauty aisles, we could show them trending and viral beauty brands as well as work with key vendor partners to offer real time personalized promotions to drive trial conversion and inspiration. And of course, digital commerce is seeing rapid growth from online marketplaces, and we've been extending our assortment through our marketplace Target Plus. Based on continued guest feedback, testing, and iterating, we've been on a journey to scale up our marketplace offerings with a wider array of brands, price points, and products in a logistically feasible and cost-effective way. And with our partnership with Shopify, we're able to more quickly identify new and emerging brands for our marketplace as well as onboard partners and products faster and easier than ever before.\nThis is contributing meaningfully to our digital traffic. In the last year alone, Target Plus represented around 10% of our external search volume. Now, to be clear, we still believe our intentional invitation-only approach is the right strategy both now and in the long haul for Target. But that hasn't prevented us from massive growth. Target Plus now generates over $1 billion in GMV, having grown more than 35% in the past year alone. This includes growth of nearly 40% in home categories, more than 60% in essentials and beauty, and more than 170% in food. This momentum isn't slowing down. In fact, we expect Target Plus to deliver upwards of $4.5 billion in annual GMV within the next five years. Yes, our strategy is different, but we believe the trust consumers have for the Target brand is a real competitive advantage and that trust should extend to our marketplace offerings too.\nSo I want to pause here for a moment and address another frequently asked question on if we would prefer to drive demand into our stores rather than online due to the incremental costs associated with digital fulfillment. Now to be clear, we think consumers should get to decide where and how they shop, not a retailer. And while our in store shopping is what made Target famous, and yes, it's the most profitable on average, our digital channel is profitable as well and continuing to get even more efficient over time. And that's without adding the benefits of Roundel and Target Plus. Jim will share more on this a bit later, but what's missing from this question is why we love seeing consumers engage with us online.\nBeyond the economics of an individual purchase is the power that each of those interactions has to deepen a consumer's connection to our brand. An opportunity that we don't take lightly. With every positive experience, we increase the affinity a guest has with our brand. They become part of the total Target ecosystem. It's why guests using our same-day services tend to spend more overall with Target, more than 20% more on average, including more in our stores. So now let's spend some time talking about our loyalty platform, Target Circle. Last year, we were sharing our relaunch plans for an already beloved program. And today I can tell you that the relaunch worked as planned, growing the love for Target Circle with new and existing members. But we aren't standing still. In fact, we have plans to make Target Circle bigger and better than ever. Bigger being the operative word. Here's a sneak peek of a spot that will air later this month.\nThat looks good. This looks good. Very, very good. Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday. Honey, maybe we should get another one. You want to get two more? Yeah, it's buy one, get one half off. Cool, Mom, stick up a sale. I can see that. Get seven days of big deals. It's Target Circle week.\nSo the marketer and me cannot help but smile watching that ad. We are going bigger because we're relentlessly focused on growing engagement with our brand and rewarding consumers for choosing Target. Our members say they love it, both with their words and with their actions. Last year, active Target Circle members spent three times more on average compared with non-members. Target Circle Card cardholders spent around six times more. Target Circle 360 members spent an average of eight times more, shopping us six times more often than non-members. But a common question I get is something like this. Cara, there's so many loyalty programs out there. Why should consumers sign up for another with Target Circle? So let me unpack this a bit.\nThe base program is completely free, providing access to automatic deals and personalized offers just for you. Simply put, you save more money just by signing up. A reminder that if you're a Target Circle Card holder, you save an extra 5% every day. Target Circle 360 members get all the benefits of our base program, plus same-day delivery from Target and other retailers. Clearly, consumers see the value of a membership in Target Circle 360, given that our membership count is more than four times greater compared to a year ago. Now I want to focus on all the ways we've differentiated our membership program, both in how it exists today and how we'll continue to make it better going forward. As with everything we do, it starts by listening to what guests tell us they want first.\nWe know that our guests love to shop across many of their favorite stores. Other membership programs only provide access to one retailer. With Target Circle 360, you already get unlimited same-day delivery with a personal shopper at Target and more than 100 other retailers. Powered by Shipt for just $99 per year and only $49 per year if you're a Target Circle Card holder. Our guests are also early adopters and love trying new things. So new this year, Target Circle 360 members will receive exciting gifts and offerings that they can choose from every month, adding an element of exclusivity and surprise for our most loyal guests. Target Circle 360 members will also get the VIP red carpet treatment with early access to exciting deals, limited-time offerings, and partnerships ahead of other guests.\nFinally, our data shows how often guests are using same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360 while traveling. So whether stocking the hotel room with snacks or quickly getting those items they forgot to pack, we know our guests love to travel and we want to help take the stress out of it. So we are incredibly excited to announce a partnership with Marriott Bonvoy coming later this fall/spring to make traveling even easier and more rewarding for Target Circle 360 members. More details to come very soon. These are just a few of the continued investments that we're making to elevate our loyalty offering, and it shows the importance of how we're thinking about differentiating our same-day delivery service too.\nIn the same way that we first became famous for our in-store experience and later led the industry with Drive Up, well, we aspire to grow same-day delivery to be another unmistakably Target offering that becomes synonymous with the elevated joy, the value, and experience that we're known for. With the signature service as a core benefit over the next three years, we believe our Target Circle 360 membership count has the potential to more than triple with opportunities to grow even further over time.\nAnd as you've heard me share before, the insights that we gain from our Target Circle members help power our media business, Roundel. These insights allow us to introduce the right brand partners and products to the right guests, creating connections that are beneficial for all involved. And we're doing it in unique ways, both on platforms that we own and those that we don't. Our approach is built for long-term success by creating value-driven placements that enhance, not disrupt, the overall experience.\nIf our aim is to put the guest at the center of every investment that we make, then our approach to digital advertising should be no different. For example, with Target product ads by Roundel, sync sponsored ads on our website and app, we help partners place ads where guests are already browsing and with shoppers who are likely to purchase. Based on our rich data and insights, this leads to very high conversion rates and return on ad spend. The result? These ad sales alone have grown more than 35% last year. Another key source of Roundel's power lies in the qualities of our audiences. Target guests who are trend forward, deeply engaged, and enjoy shopping, the richness of our guest base and the trust they have for our brand. This is why we're seeing outsized growth.\nIt's also why we have so much confidence in Roundel's ability to scale for years to come. We continue to innovate and prove our value to existing partners who spend more with us every year. We're also making it easier for smaller emerging brands to utilize the power of Roundel's reach. And in the last year we've grown this partner segment by more than 40%. At nearly $2 billion in value for Target, we see the potential for Roundel to double its size over the next five years.\nI want to pause here to address the notion that these digital offerings are alternative revenue streams or ancillary businesses. Others may talk about them this way, but at Target they're part of our holistic ecosystem and one only provides value because of how it works with the rest of the portfolio. The reason why Target Circle is a beloved loyalty platform is because it's attached to a brand that consumers love. Roundel is powered by the robust insights that come from Target Circle, and as we grow our offerings on Target Plus, well, that allows Roundel to onboard new advertising partners more quickly too. Our ecosystem is not a collection of individual capabilities or offerings, but parts of a whole that interact harmoniously to serve our guests each and every day.\nSo over the past year we've continued to invest in opportunities to be the best version of ourselves for our guests today and tomorrow, and that isn't slowing down. We'll continue to find ways to unapologetically set ourselves apart, to offer an experience that is uniquely Target, and to continue to provide more than consumers even knew they could expect from us. With that, I'll welcome Jim to the stage for his first financial community meeting.\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Cara. I've been at Target for about six months now, and while I've already had the chance to meet some of you, I'm looking forward to spending many more times with you in the year ahead. Since I arrived, I developed a much deeper appreciation for the strength of the Target business model and the team that supports it. In particular, I want to thank my members of my talented finance team who focus on being outstanding business partners while ensuring we make the right long term financial decisions. I was excited to come to Target because of the amazing brand backed by assets and scale that we can apply throughout our business, including nearly 2,000 stores served by more than 60 supply chain facilities and an experienced global sourcing organization with offices around the world.\nA large and diversified owned brand portfolio generating more than $31 billion in annual sales. A unique and balanced mix of six core merchandise categories spanning both wants and daily needs, each of which generates well over $10 billion in annual sales. A full suite of digital fulfillment capabilities that together account for more than $20 billion in annual sales, with one of the fastest growing marketplaces in Target Plus and one of the biggest loyalty programs in the country, Target Circle, which helps to fuel Roundel, one of the largest retail advertising businesses in the US. With all these assets supporting our differentiated strategy, Target has a compelling growth opportunity in the years ahead, and I'm looking forward to sharing our progress with you over time.\nAs you know, we faced some unexpected challenges in 2024, and we're encouraged that we ended the year with stronger than expected Q4 performance. When we first provided fourth quarter top line guidance last November, we expected comparable sales in a range around flat. This morning we reported a 1.5% increase in Q4 comp sales consistent with our January update. When we guided Q4 EPS back in November, we specified a range of $1.85 to 2.45, and this morning we reported Q4 GAAP and adjusted EPS of $2.41 near the very high end of that range. It's also notable that despite the volatility we saw on a quarterly basis, our full year results ended up within the top and bottom line ranges that Michael provided at the beginning of the year.\nWhile last year's EPS was slightly lower than in 2023, that year also included a 53rd week when we adjust for our estimate of the benefit of that extra week. On an apples-to-apples basis, 2024 net sales grew by about 1% over 2023, and full year EPS grew by about 3%. Among other highlights in 2024 was a healthy increase in guest traffic in both our stores and our digital channels. Within digital, we saw double-digit growth in both Drive Up and same-day delivery, powered by Target Circle 360. We also saw more than 35% growth in third-party GMV on Target Plus last year, with more than 40% growth in Q4. Roundel also had another strong year with growth in the mid-teens.\nBeyond getting to know the Target team, I've also gained a deeper appreciation for the ways that Target is unique within the US market. For example, as Tara highlighted earlier, our approach to digital commerce is distinctly different from other retailers, and I want to dig into that because things might look similar on the surface. For instance, when you look across the top of this slide, you see a complete omnichannel retailer offering in-store shopping and a full suite of digital fulfillment options. But what makes Target unique is the way those fulfillment options work together to increase guest engagement more broadly. As Michael mentioned earlier, when guests try our Drive Up and same-day delivery services, they increase their overall spending by an average of more than 20%, including more spending in our stores.\nYou don't hear that from others and it's a tangible example of the power of and that Cara described earlier. Another important aspect of our digital strategy is the way we choose our assortment and how that plays into our supply chain strategy. In managing our assortment, we focus first on selecting the right set of items in the categories our guests expect from us. Then we determine the appropriate channel by item and category. Because of this selective approach, most of our first party digital sales come from items we offer both online and in our stores. This fits perfectly with our Stores-as-Hubs model, allowing us to leverage our stores, assets, inventory, and team to fulfill a very high percentage of our first party demand, more than 97% in 2024.\nIt's a model that delivers speed and efficiency in a capital-light manner, and importantly, it's scalable as our digital sales have more than tripled over the last five years on largely the same asset base. Of course, beyond the direct impact and benefit of first-party sales, the digital channel also powers our Roundel ad business and our Target Plus marketplace. Target Plus is an agile capital-light option for selling a wide range of products from distinctive brands without the need to buy, store, and move the inventory ourselves. As a result, Target Plus is especially well suited for items that turn slowly, items that occupy a lot of physical space, and ones for which demand tends to be variable and less predictable.\nWhile Target Plus is a relatively small contributor to our P&L today, there's a compelling opportunity to rapidly expand our Target Plus assortment, benefiting both our top line and bottom line in 2025 and beyond. So now I want to touch on the profitability of our digital business because the answer is different from what many people believe. Last year, even if we narrowly focused on the direct impact of digital sales, the digital channel at Target delivered incremental profit dollars to our business. Now to be clear, the profit rate in the digital channel is lower than our stores, but digital growth is good for our bottom line, and we have clear plans in place to further improve our digital profitability over time. I also want to note this analysis of digital profitability doesn't rely on the sizable indirect benefits we gain from our digital platform, including revenue from Roundel and Target Plus, and, importantly, the growth in store sales we see when a guest tries one of our digital services.\nTo emphasize that point, our first party digital business delivers incremental profit to our bottom line, even if we exclude the indirect benefits from Roundel and Target Plus. Beyond digital profitability, I want to also unpack a few of our financial metrics behind our six core merchandising categories because understanding these dynamics is critical to understanding our business. At the top of this slide you can see the percentage of our sales in each of our six core categories. A balanced mix you don't see anywhere else. Retail. The next line compares the gross margin rates in each of these categories, ranging from the lowest rate in hard lines to more than double that rate in apparel. This wide range is an important part of understanding our financial results because variability in category growth rates can have a very meaningful impact on our gross margin rate.\nAnd over the last five years, the range of margin mix impacts has been quite wide, from as much as a 160 basis points headwind in the first quarter of 2020 to 150 basis points tailwind a year later. Next on the slide, you can see our own brand mix, which runs from more than 75% in apparel to the low single digits to single digits in beauty and hard lines. Obviously this metric is important strategically, but it also has implications for our financial results. Own brands are a key part of our differentiation, and they typically earn higher gross margin rates than our national brands. They also involve longer lead times, giving us less flexibility to react to changes in sales trends. That last point relates to the next row on the table showing the relative space occupied by these categories in the supply chain.\nTogether, these two metrics help to illustrate a challenge that we encountered in Q3 of last year, when a meaningful slowdown in home put extra pressure on our supply chain and stores. At the same time, they were handling peak volume in advance of the holidays. As a result, and as Rick covered earlier, the team has been working to reduce lead times in our longest lead apparel and home categories. This effort will be an ongoing journey, but we've already made progress, most notably in apparel, and over time this work will benefit our business in many ways, especially when volatility is high. More specifically, with shorter lead times, we can react more quickly when consumer demand rises to replenish more quickly and maximize sales. Conversely, when demand softens unexpectedly, shorter lead times allow us to adjust inventories more quickly and reduce markdown exposure.\nIn addition, this work can help our supply chain by reducing peaks, valleys, and storage needs when there's a volatility in demand. Beyond our work on lead times, the team is leaning into Target Plus as a way to augment our assortment without taking on the inventory, risk, and capacity needs of our First Party business. While there's potential across our entire assortment, we see a big opportunity in home where an extended assortment on Target Plus can enhance the relevance of our assortment, especially for items that are bulky and not well suited for guests to bring home in their car. Finally, as you see at the bottom of the slide, you can see the relative variability in sales trends in each of these core categories over time.\nNot surprisingly, variability is highest on the discretionary side of our assortment where guests can rapidly adjust their short term spending as conditions change. With about half of our sales in these categories, we naturally have more variability in our business than if we only sold our frequency categories. But importantly, we're also compensated for that variability as our highest margin categories are also on the discretionary side of our business.\nWith that as context, I want to move to our longer term financial aspirations which remain largely consistent with what we shared before. Michael outlined the addressable market opportunity earlier and with our scale, assets, and strategy, we're looking to address that opportunity by maintaining or growing share in categories that we sell, resulting in an average of low to mid single digit top line growth over time. And notably over the last five years, Target's average top line growth has exceeded that pace, resulting in total growth of about 36%, a number that compares favorably to the retail sector, and consumer spending over that period. But growth rates varied widely over that period, with nearly half of that, nearly all that growth in the first two years and flattish trends since then.\nThis reflects our strong mix of discretionary categories and the dramatic swings in consumer spending that happens during the pandemic and the period of high inflation that followed. Today, while consumer spending trends are not yet back to normal, we're seeing some encouraging trends in our discretionary business, including three consecutive quarters of share gains in apparel, improving share trends in our home business, and holiday season share gains in both sporting goods and toys within hardlines. When combined with steady growth in our frequency categories and ongoing share gains in beauty, we feel well positioned to deliver long term top line growth.\nTurning to profitability, we expect to grow our operating margin rate over time based on multiple profit enhancing opportunities ahead of us. Among those tailwinds, we expect continued outsized growth from Roundel and Target Plus, both of which are accretive to our operating margin rate. We're expecting more good news from shrink in 2025 and beyond. As you recall, from 2019 through 2023 our operating margin absorbed about 120 basis points of pressure from higher inventory shrink. Last year we recovered about 1/3 of that pressure as a lower financial impact from shrink was an approximate 40 basis point tailwind to our full year operating margin rate. Given recent trends and the increased focus on retail crime we've seen at the federal, state, and local level, we expect to benefit from further shrink improvement in 2025 and beyond.\nBeyond shrink, we expect to benefit from ongoing efficiency efforts throughout our business. In the last two years since we launched the work, we've already attained the initial goal of more than $2 billion in savings. That doesn't mean we're going to stop. Rather, it will become an ongoing mindset across our business to find savings opportunities we can take to the bottom line or reinvest in support of our guest experience, lower prices, and our team. Altogether. With these margin opportunities, we believe we're positioned to deliver mid- to high-single-digit annual EPS growth over the next several years.\nWith our scale, if we hold or gain share in each across our merchandise categories, we can expand the size of our business by more than $15 billion over five years, an amount that's larger than many of our retail peers. Now I want to turn to our outlook for 2025 on the top line. This year we're continuing to plan cautiously and are looking to grow our net sales in a range around 1% with expected comparable sales around flat. We're planning to deliver a modest increase in our operating margin rate this year as profit tailwinds offset continued investments in long-term profitable growth.\nFor the year, we're expecting an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%, which includes the implementation of new global minimum tax rates rules. Altogether, we're expecting 2025 in adjusted EPS of $8.80 to 9.80. Regarding capital deployment, I'll first reiterate our long-standing priorities. We first look to invest fully in our business in products that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of more than 50 years of annual increase. And finally, we look to return any excess cash beyond those first two uses through share repurchases over time within the constraints of our middle A credit ratings.\nRegarding the first priority, we continue to expect CapEx of $4 to 5 billion this year. The bulk of these investments will be focused on stores, including both new locations and existing ones. In addition, we're making robust investments in both supply chain and technology to support the initiatives our team highlighted earlier. Regarding the dividend, we plan to recommend that the Board approve a low single digit increase in the quarterly dividend later this year. Finally, beyond those first two uses, we expect to have capacity for share repurchases within the limits of our credit ratings.\nAs always, the timing and magnitude will depend on business results and our assessment of the external environment. In particular, we plan to maintain some extra flexibility in the near term to help us navigate uncertain uncertainty regarding tariffs with a sourcing organization that's decades old. Our team has a lot of experience in navigating this type of volatility. They're monitoring the situation carefully and we expect to successfully navigate through any changes just like we have in the past. However, given near term uncertainty, we'll be looking to maintain a larger than normal cushion on the balance sheet.\nAs always, our team will focus first on minimizing any impact on our guests as we manage our business to deliver on our financial goals. Finally, I want to spend a minute on our guidance practices and our decision to move away from quarterly guidance. This change reflects our expectation of continued elevated volatility, which limits the effectiveness of quarterly forecasts. As an example, consider the impact of warm weather on apparel sales in last year's third quarter. Namely, our apparel comp moved from more than 3% growth in Q2 to down nearly 1% in Q3, back up to 3.5% growth in Q4.\nEven as we move to annual guidance, we'll have the opportunity to revisit our full year outlook after every quarter and assess whether any changes might be appropriate. And of course, we can comment on timing considerations and prior year comparisons. I'd like to comment on our top line results so far this quarter as sales have become more volatile since the recent holiday season. More specifically, in February, we saw record sales performance on Valentine's Day, but overall top line performance for the month was soft as cold weather affected apparel sales and consumer confidence declines, impacting our discretionary assortment more broadly. Looking ahead, we expect to see a moderation in this trend as apparel sales respond to warmer weather around the country.\nGiven our performance around Valentine's Day, we're looking forward to the Easter holiday where we'll feature a seasonal assortment ranging from candy to toys, home decor, and apparel, and of course, everything needed for Easter dinner. Beyond the impact of these early top line trends, we're expecting some outsized profit pressures in this year's first quarter compared with the rest of the year. These include tariff uncertainty, expected startup costs from a ramp up in new stores and remodel projects, and the timing of certain SG&A and tax expenses within the year. In contrast, we'll face easier profit comparisons in the back half of the year, including the Q3 benefit from lapping last year's unexpected supply chain costs, which we don't expect to repeat in 2025.\nAs I get ready to hand things back to Brian, I want to start by thanking the entire Target team for their tireless efforts to support our guests, our business, and each other. Our teams have managed through several years of elevated volatility and they've never lost their focus on serving our guests. I also want to thank everyone who's here today for your continued interest in Target. In the same way that volatility presents a challenge for our team, we know it's challenging for investors. Today we are laser focused on reducing volatility in our business as we focus on controlling what we can control. And with the potential for reduced volatility combined with growth prospects ahead of us, there's a compelling opportunity to reward shareholders over time. With that, I'll turn things back over to Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, thank you Jim. In a minute I'll invite the team back to the stage to answer your questions. But before I do, let me recap a few key points, points starting with the three questions I posed at the beginning of the meeting. What is Target's unique place in retail? How will Target build more engagement with even more consumers? And how will that engagement translate to traffic, sales, and profitability over the next five years? As we shared with you today, we are very confident in our path forward because we have the scale, the strategy, and the capabilities to make Target a long-term winner in retail. It always starts with product. We've grown sales across all six categories or assortment resulting in overall growth of nearly $30 billion over the last five years. We're the fifth largest frequency player in US retail.\nWe're accelerating investments in our discretionary categories to build on to more than $50 billion in annual sales in hard lines, home, and apparel. We're giving guests access to thousands of trusted products and brands through our billion-dollar marketplace, Target Plus, a marketplace. We expect to reach $5 billion in GMV over the next five years. We pair this newness with relevance, and value in our assortment and an experience that makes it easy and fun for consumers to shop in the way that works best for them. As a result, guests made 350 million more trips to Target last year than they did in 2019.\nThose trips are part of an ecosystem of marketing, advertising, loyalty, benefits, and digital and in-store experiences that make every trip tailored to the needs and preferences of our guests. That level of personalization and flexibility is a win-win for our guests and our business. Our industry-leading same-day services are growing at a double-digit pace and even more growth potential ahead. Target Circle 360 membership quadrupled since launch and we've added benefits like a partnership with Marriott to maintain that momentum and our media business. Roundel continues to generate nearly $2 billion in value for Target while creating connections with consumers and brands that we believe will allow it to double in size in the next five years. All this comes together in a roadmap for growth that we expect to deliver more than $15 billion in sales growth over the next five years.\nToday's Tarzhay. It's here that the consistent drumbeat of every discovery and delight we offer to consumers. It stays true to who we've always been, keeps pace with consumer trends, and leverages our connection to culture, creates great trends on our own, while always thinking long-term about the unique role Target plays in retail and in the lives of millions of consumers we serve each and every day. Thank you once again for being here today. Now I'll invite Michael, Rick, Cara, and Jim to join me on the stage to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now transition into taking questions from our audience. If you have a question, please raise your hand.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAll right. Absolutely. Love the show of hands as we started to walk the back of the stage. Michael Lasser, I think I saw your hand go up very first. I'll give you the first question today.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Hardlines, Broadlines, and Food Retail, UBS\n\nThank you very much, Brian. Michael Lasser from UBS. It seemed like one of the messages today that Target offered is we can still generate growth but also increase the predictability and lower the volatility of the business based on some of the investments that we're making in systems, team members, and infrastructure. So, A, is that right? And B, when are we going to, when is it realistic for outsiders to start to see that play out in the P&L because it has been quite volatile over the last few years. I'll add my second question. Speaking of volatility, the tariff situation remains quite fluid based on what you know today. How did you factor that into your guidance for 2025? Thank you very much.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael. It's a great place to start. And those are two powerful takeaways that focus on consistency and reliability. You've heard it from Michael. You heard it throughout our discussions and today. Certainly, Jim and I have spent a lot of time talking about consistency going forward. Michael, I'm going to let you start and talk about the focus on reliability. And Jim, let's kind of share some thoughts on the importance of consistency as we go forward.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, it's a good question, Michael. And think about it and we think about it is consistent progress over time. And you could hear us building on momentum in some cases where we talked about, you know, we've had availability inventory reliability improvements for eight quarters in a row now, and we want to build on that with more progress as we move through the quarters of 2025. You heard Rick share, as we're shortening lead times, discretionary categories are going to come inherently with more volatility than food staples. But when we can pull 20% of our lead times out of a category like apparel, and that's some of the thinking that's gone into our lead times that are powering the receipts that we take in through 2025 in that category, we'd expect that to help us reduce that volatility over time.\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. If I add, I think clearly it's important for us as we focus on delivering value for the long term, but we clearly understand the value of consistency as well. I think you'll see an ongoing journey as we're trying to reduce volatility. It'll take some time and there's certainly stepping stones along the way, but it'll take some time to get to the end goal. But that's our focus and also our focus is going to be on controlling what we can control. There's elements out there that are uncontrollable, but we're going to focus on what we can do the best and be as efficient as we can be.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, turning to your question about tariffs, and obviously we've spent a lot of time as a team talking about tariffs. We've got a very experienced team in place. We've been here before. We've managed through tariffs in the past. But Rick, you talked on stage today about some of the changes we've been making. Obviously, speed and flexibility is important in this environment. Why don't you start, Michael? Why don't you build on some of the changes and the thoughts we have around tariffs right now?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, and I think I'd start with the team. We have a really incredible team, both in global sourcing as well as design. You know, decades of experience and under their leadership they've been very proactive and been thinking about this for years now and have been working to diversify our country of production. And so we have been pulling, moving things out of China to other places around the world, looking at, going across Asia as well as Western Hemisphere, Guatemala, and Honduras. So we have a much more diverse set of countries from which we produce. And I think that's just going to give us more flexibility and help us be more agile. You use the word, I think you used the word dynamic or fluid to describe tariffs and we see it very much the same way.\nWe just need to make sure that we have options and that we're being flexible. As we're going through this and navigating sort of the changes, that we continue to put the consumer first and that we're thinking through, how are we going to navigate this while delivering the value that we've committed to deliver to the consumer?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, before I turn it over to you, to be really clear, for everyone that's here today, when we think about tariff and tariff implications, we always start with the impact on consumers and the families we serve and how in an environment like this we continue to make sure we're providing the affordability and value they're looking for. Michael, I know that's been part of our conversation for a long time now as we think about the impact of tariffs.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, absolutely. I think Rick said it well. I mean it starts with a great team and a huge thanks to the team that works through what we expect to kind of navigate as we move through 2025. But to connect that question to the one we just had before, you also heard Rick describe and we diversify our countries of production, especially in the Western hemisphere. We actually get the benefit of speed too. And so that helps us read trend. It helps us reduce volatility from an inventory perspective in those businesses.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nLet me start over here, Simeon.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi everyone. Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. I want to point it to Jim and then bring everyone back in. There was a 6% margin target, EBIT margin target at one point. We didn't hear about that today. There was maybe a mid single digital reference to long-term EPS growth. Can you talk about the either reinvestment rate of the business or providing you more flexibility. And then, Brian, more broadly, is there a greater reinvestment as you look at this business given the factors that retailers are facing? Thanks.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nJim. I'll let you start.\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYep. I mean, in terms referencing the 6%, one is continuous productivity, and think about continually fueling our investments for our business. As Michael stated last year, I mean of the six that we look for what's the optimal rate of which we can maximize our profit dollar growth over time. We certainly think we have tailwinds and continued operating profit margin that we expect to maintain this year and years going forward. We expect to make that progress with, in addition to newness and affordability, merchandising, and a lot of things we do in our core digital growth and high growth platforms like Roundel and Target Plus, are going to be accretive, and we also have the continued tailwinds from shrink as well.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation",
    "content3": "Simeon, on the investment side, I'll go all the way back to the tax rate adjustments back in 2017. Since that time we've invested well over $50 billion of capital in our business, in our stores, supply chain, and technology. We've been investing in building new capabilities and Cara can talk about the capabilities that we built from a marketing standpoint. Investing in new initiatives. Rick, investing in tools to make sure we're better merchants. So we've been investing in our business for a number of years and it's a combination of strategy, scale, and capabilities that for me is so important as we sit here today and gives us so much confidence in the future.\nBut Cara, why don't you talk about some of the investments we've made in marketing because I know Michael, we talk a lot about stores, and I know you've been tracking the investments we've made in stores and the new stores, new full-size stores we're building, and the work on supply chain and remodels. But why don't you give the group an example of some of the investments we've been making from a marketing and loyalty and capability standpoint.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nI was going to say, and just piggybacking off of the conversation around how we think through. You mentioned digital is an always on investment as we think through the power of what investing in stores has done for us to be able to propel to our digital business to where it is today. And we think through this intersection of digital stores and social as being really the sweet spot for how we connect with consumers. And so our investments in marketing have come alongside that. There's no better example of today's Tarzhay than if you look at how we show up on social. As an example, I mentioned the power of the Target brand being the number one engaged with brand. That's both based on how we put things out into the world, newness, content.\nIt's also how consumers talk about us and the power of how they talk through that. So if I think about where we're then leveraging that power of those marketing investments to make our digital experiences smarter, to make those more targeted by thinking through, you know, modern retailer today, physical, no one has a better store experience than us. Social, we have the power of the brand. You have the investments that we've made consistently in digital. I think that really sets us up for success going forward.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRick, one of the things that we know we've been investing in, and you talked about it today from the stage is our own brand portfolio. We talk about a $31 billion own brand portfolio, close to a dozen billion-dollar brands. $4 billion. They're on their way to be $3 or 4 billion-dollar brands. We've been making big investments in our own brand portfolio and those capabilities. And I know you and your team run it like a consumer-packaged goods company. Why don't you give the group a sense for the way we're investing in our own brands and the capabilities behind those brands?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSure, I would love to. I mean, first of all, the fact that we refer to them as own brands says something. We don't think of them as private label. We don't think of them as labels. They are brands that have positioning, that have meaning, that have a clear consumer target and bring differentiation to the marketplace. To do that, we have to continue to not just launch brands, but we have to manage brands and make sure that we're bringing innovation and news to those brands. And I think the couple examples I would highlight is up&up. It's a brand that's been around for a long time, has lots and lots of items, but it needed a refresh.\nAnd so we went in and invested in the brand, redesigned all the packaging, graphics, took about 40% of the line, and did product improvements, new fragrances, more sustainable packaging. And we're really excited about that. And that's what we think you need to do to keep brands contemporary and relevant. The other example I would just give you really quickly is All in Motion. All in Motion. As you know, it's our performance brand for the whole family, and we continue to invest in that brand with new fabrications, new colors, new silhouettes, and that news and that investment in the brand is paying off, and we are seeing double digit growth on All in Motion in the fourth quarter, and it's actually been growing for quite some time now. And so those are just two examples across frequency and discretion. Discretionary. When you think about the brand portfolio that we have, we're investing in all of those brands to keep them relevant and to keep them growing.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, we've been investing in stores and, obviously, supply chain. Maybe expand on some of the investments, including the capabilities that we've been enhancing to run our stores and our DCs even more efficiently?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, you heard me refer today to some of the technology investments we continue to make. I mean, some of that system modernization and supply chain is at the core of how we buy and replenish product. We've been on a multi-year journey that I'm excited about what the progress in 2025 will be to bring more of those capabilities to more of the assortment. Then another place where I get excited. You could probably pick it up in today's presentation of where we're innovating is when it comes to the speed that we can drive in our stores as hubs model, and some of you have had the chance to visit us or tour a sortation center, and you can see what those facilities have done for us.\nBut what we think we can pull off in some of the markets that don't have a sortation center that can make us even faster with package delivery, and make us more efficient. Another great example of kind of a sustained focus on how we get more efficient over time. I get excited about what 2025 will hold there.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSimeon, I'll end with one other area that we've made big investments in the last few years, and we couldn't cover everything today. I know we covered a lot of ground, but Rick talked about the dramatic growth we've seen in food and beverage over the last few years. That is a byproduct of consistent investments in our food supply chain, in our sourcing capabilities, in our in-store experience, in our team at store level that's managing food each and every day. Those have been a big part of the acceleration we've seen in food and food. And Cara, you talked about the fact that we're now one of the biggest digital food retailers in the United States. It's a byproduct of consistent investments behind those key drivers in our business. Go right up here in the middle.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. Good morning, and thanks for the presentation.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMorning Chris.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nWell, I'll give both questions like Michael did. So my first question is longer term. You know, Target Plus going from $1 to 5 billion. It's a big number. That's big growth. Is that what's driving that? Is that a way to think about how the assortment is going to expand over time? Obviously there's a marketing push there as well. And would you ever consider sort of a fulfilled by Target kind of model, and then more in the near term as you think about the pressures that you're talking about? In Q1, inventory is up 7%. I know you talked about it a little bit. To what extent are you baking in some excess clearance of promotional pressure? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nCara. Why don't you start?\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSure. I think on the Target Plus front, I think it's always important to start with why we have a differentiated strategy. Consumers don't expect Target to carry every single item that's out there. They do expect us to carry on trend affordable, high quality products, and they expect us to stand behind each and every one. That being said, that strategy does not prohibit us from growth. We grew Target Plus by 35% in this past year, accelerated in the fourth quarter by complementing the assortment strategy that Rick talked about in apparel. You saw from Jim, 75% own brand. Target Plus allows us to add key national brands like the Peloton fitness apparel or Crocs footwear in home. Breadth of style is critically important. We are a style authority, so Target Plus allows us to actually capitalize on all of those trends.\nSo we hit the $1 billion mark. We have our eyes set on the next milestone, which is $5 billion in five years. It is a big number. That's just the milestone. That's not the end game. We see consistent growth because we've continued to lean in, be consumer led. We've tested and iterated to get to this point. We see great growth ahead.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nChristian said, we talked a lot about February and a number of different factors. We talked about extreme cold. I was reminded this morning there were floods and fires across the country in February. Consumer confidence has dipped. We've all seen those numbers. There are some other factors as consumers think about the potential impact on tariffs and what it will mean for them. But Rick, you had some real important highlights as we think about February, and importantly, we've got spring and Easter in front of us. So why don't you talk about kind of where we are and kind of the next step forward as we go into March and April, and then Jim, you can talk about how we factored these tariff components into our guidance.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSure, I'd be happy to. I mean, and I think, Jim, you mentioned this February was volatile and there was a lot of things going on out in the macro environment. But there were some things that give us encouragement, some proof points that give us some optimization going into the spring. The first one that I would highlight is although consumers are strapped, they're on a budget, they're under financial pressure, they still are prioritizing and leaning in to those special holiday moments. We saw that in Valentine's Day. We had record sales in Valentine's Day. That bodes really well for Easter. So we are encouraged by that and looking forward to Easter. The second thing I would say is we talked about the consumer being very resourceful, looking for lowest prices, the best deals. We saw that play out with Circle Week in the fall.\nIt was our biggest fall promotion that we have ever had. We're coming up on Circle Week in a few weeks. There's a lot of reason to believe that from a consumer perspective that that will be really relevant and that they will, that will lean in there. The third thing that gives us confidence going into spring is the weather has been very volatile. In certain markets where we've seen the weather break at least for a week or so, what we've seen is our apparel, particularly our most weather impacted apparel categories, see an acceleration in trend up to almost 600 basis points. And we're seeing that across swim, kids, and men's, which tend to be the most weather impacted apparel categories. And that gives us confidence that we've got the right styles, we've got the right colors, we have the right content for spring.\nSo the weather will change. It will change. And when it does, we feel like we're going to be really prepared to have great style, great design at affordable prices, which has really been the equation for success in the apparel business.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nJim?\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, in terms of all the things that are happening in the market. So our full year guidance will reflect sort of a wide range of potential scenarios and uncertainty that we see in the marketplace right now. So that certainly covers tariffs and certain things. As I mentioned, we're going to be focusing on controlling what we can control. What we don't know is potential consumer demand. That's across the board, based on how tariffs ripple across the economy, for instance. But we have that wide range for the reason, as I mentioned earlier, like moving off of quarterly guidance to annual guidance just reflects the fact that we are in a position of elevated volatility.So there's going to be swings up and down across the quarters and we think that's the prudent play.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRight. We're going to come back to the slide.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director and Head of Consumer and Retail Research, Melius Research\n\nHi, Karen Short from Melius Research. Thanks for taking the questions and thanks for today. So my question is or two how much are you expecting in savings and how much will that benefit the actual full year guidance? And then the second question is when you look at Q2 to Q4 can you just talk about the puts and takes in terms of gross margins and SGA and you know, how do you think about the cadence of EPS Q2 to Q4?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, I might ask you to start with the plans we've had in place for a number of years now around efficiency driving effectiveness throughout the organization and how we've embedded that in kind of everything we do.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, Jim said it. Well, I mean, you can think of that as always on going forward, and I think you can see even in our guidance for the year to be expanding operating margin on a flat comp implies some healthy efficiency gains from within the business. So we expect the team to lean in and deliver those just like we laid out with our guidance. But it shows up all over the place. It shows up in the fulfillment example, and if you go back on what's been driving some of those efficiency gains going before, reducing the number of split package shipments has made us more profitable when we ship product to the sortation centers. We saw our sortation center packages delivered by drivers using the Shipt capability up over 30% last year.\nSo that just means a lot more packages delivered in a more cost-efficient manner. Those are the types of efficiencies among many others. I mean, I get the pleasure every week of seeing a scorecard that lets us know operationally how we are performing in our stores. That scorecard was screaming greener and greener as we moved through last year. When we're on our best practices, it sets us up to achieve the consistency you heard me talk about, we want to drive in 2025, but it also drives efficiency within the business. We know when we're executing well, we're making it most efficient for our teams.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRick, I know your teams are focused on efficiency and everything they do from assortment planning, pricing, and promotion, how you're running the business. If you shared a few examples, and then it's so important that we've been leading and really infusing GenAI, and how we're handling marketing and building loyalty. Sharing some of those examples would be really helpful for the group.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean where we are focused on in merchandising is how do we modernize merchandising and what we call the roundtable, the cross-functional team that comes together. What we've recognized is the world has changed, speed is critical, trends happen really fast. Something goes viral on TikTok and it could be the leopard print or it could be something else, and we have to be on top of that and we have to be able to move quickly, and that's going to require a new way of doing work and a new way of doing business.\nSo that we've initiated that process now, and our hope is through this calendar year to kind of really redefine how merchants show up, how they spend their time, and the goal of it really is to kind of take some of that non value added work off of the plate so that merchants can lean in externally and be more creative and looking for new opportunities. So that's, that's really what we're focused on.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nI would just comment on how we leverage again the consistent investments in technology and AI to really power our digital platform, to power loyalty as well, and our ad business, Roundel. If I talk through sort of traditional AI, I mentioned that we made a ton of investments and improvements in our algorithms this year; we're seeing really great results from that. It's also important to point out that AI powers Target Circle, and so as we think through our ability to have our large multimillion dollar or multimillion member base, we now are able to actually give personalized promotions which leverage science so that we're more efficient and more profitable as we think through our ability to drive a better guest experience but also make it more efficient for Target.\nThen I hit on some of the places where we're then layering out with GenAI, and GenAI is exciting because it's human-based technology can make the experience richer. It also can just be more efficient for us as humans to be able to consume information and make purchase decisions.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSo, you think about kind of start of year, back half of the year, maybe we'll just keep it at an EPS level. How are we feeling about the business and what kind of guidance do you want to provide?\n\nJim Lee\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I think part of my commentary was about also we'll have easier profit comparisons in the second half of the year overlapping the Q3 supply chain challenges. There's also a timing aspect I think Cara, you mentioned there's a timing aspect of SG&A when they'll hit our P&L this year. So it'd be much more front loaded in the first half versus the second half.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nGreat. All right, why don't we go back a couple of rows, and I'm sorry, we're staring into the lights now so I'm just going to let them right there. That sounds great. Thank you.\n\nCristina Morales\n\nAnalyst, Signum Research\n\nHi. Thank you. This is Cristina Morales from Signum Research. My question is regarding growth. How do you expect to gain more market share? Is it in store base, Drive Up, more digitally? How do you expect to gain that share?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRick, I might ask you to start, but I know Kira has a point of view on this as well. We've spent a lot of time thinking about share opportunities across our entire portfolio. The changes that are taking place in retail, physical opportunities, digital opportunities, how we leverage some of the capabilities we've been investing in for years. Why don't you start, Rick?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, and I would start with, you know, a comment that Cara made in her presentation. We're starting with a consumer and we're starting with where the consumer wants to shop. That's what we'll be when we get the consumer to be more of an omnichannel consumer shopping multiple different fulfillment nodes, multiple fulfillment types. We see them spend a whole lot more. So you'll see us actually try to facilitate more of that for people who are shopping in store, getting them to shop digital, people who are shopping digital to try to do a Drive Up or to try to come into store to the degree that we can bring people into the Target ecosystem and have them use different services and participate in different programs like Circle to become stickier and stickier and they become more loyal and loyal.\nSo we don't really think about it as like, let's prioritize different options as much as let's get the consumer in and have them use multiple different types so they ultimately become more loyal.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nI would just add on. I think Rick said it really well. Shopping has evolved quite significantly, and so how consumers are actually interacting with our different fulfillment services is very different today than it was even just a few years ago. I think if we think about how we design our experience, we want to create and continue to invest in that signature in-store experience. Physical retail. You heard this from all of us. We really believe in the power. When people think Target, they think let me grab that Starbucks and roam the aisle and see what's new. We love that that's evolved though in terms of what they're putting in their cart when they're in stores versus maybe what they did in their Drive Up order.\nSo, in-store experience, truly signature Drive Up experience, truly signature same-day delivery experience, and I would also truly signature social experience. As we think through those four areas, the intersection of them, we really want to ensure that those are the places that we're doubling down and investing in to connect with consumers go forward.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI'll go back to a slide that Michael had in his presentation. Now $4.2 trillion of US retail dollars, and of the top 10 players, they represent under 40%. We're a 3 share today. But over years and years, we've been investing in this amazing product assortment, this unique combination of amazing national brand partners, this robust $31 billion own brand portfolio, and all the great emerging brands that want to do business with Target and start on our shelves and be part of our digital ecosystem. The work we've been doing from a digital standpoint, thinking about physical, digital, and the components of social and making it really easy for our guests to shop with us, and Michael, we never lose focus on those retail fundamentals. Just making sure that we're more reliable.\nEvery time you shop, we think in a world where there is going to be further fallout in retail. It seems like almost every couple of weeks we see one of our competitors saying they're closing stores, they're rationalizing a portfolio. Those are all share opportunities for us, and we've got 2,000 amazing stores today. We'll be sitting on the stage in a few years' time on how we have 2,300 and we're in different locations. We'll have a bigger and more robust digital business with services like Target Circle 360 that just make it really easy for you to engage in the brand. So we see significant opportunities. We talked about more than $15 billion today. But when we look at the entire retail universe and where we sit today, we think we have some amazing assets and capabilities to leverage and a terrific team. Keep moving down the line.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks, Paul Lejuez, Citi. Let's see, curious around that flat comp that you talked about for FY 2025. Which categories do you expect to be above? Which ones do you expect to be below? Also, curious about how you're thinking on food inflation and what are we going to do about eggs?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRick, you want to start with eggs or you want to start with some opportunities for growth?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP and Chief Commerical Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I think as we looked to 2025 and what we decided to do was to take a conservative posture given all of the volatility, particularly in some of the discretionary businesses. What we said is let's plan conservatively and then let's see how things unfold with the consumer, their mindset, their behaviors, and then to the degree that we need to chase into volume we can do that. We think on our frequency businesses it's a little bit more predictable, tariffs aside, and they've been giving like delivering single-digit growth, and so we anticipate that that will continue going forward. So it's a little bit of a punchy posturing on trying to be conservative given the volatility that we see.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMaggie, I want to make sure if you have a question. I've seen you sit there patiently. I don't want to put you on the spot, but I give you a chance to answer it. No. Then I see a hand on the aisle right here in white. If we could hand her the mic.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Retail, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much. Zhihan Ma from Bernstein. A quick follow-up question on e-commerce. I think Jim, you mentioned that it's already profitable except for Target Circle 360 and all of the memberships as well. What are the levers you can pull to improve the core e-commerce profitability from here, and on top of that, on the Circle 360 program? What makes you differentiate it given that people are only going to have maybe a few paid memberships a year? Thank you.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nI'm happy to start on the profit journey we've been on. It was fun to hear Jim unpack some of what we see today, and we think we're just getting started there. We see opportunity to get more efficient in all those paths of fulfillment over time. The most expensive thing to do will always be to ship a package or ship a brown box. You've heard us describe a couple of times today some of what we're excited about that we think can add speed and reduce cost in package fulfillment. But we're also hard at work on how we make the other parts of the experience more efficient. Some of the tools and technology that we built in a hurry as Drive Up exploded in the early days of the pandemic.\nWe're going back to now with an eye to how can we take Footsteps out for our store team to allow those processes to function even faster. That'll be work that we continue to make progress on in 2025. And so I get excited about our starting point. Sure. But even more exciting about the efficiency that we think with our scale we can drive in all that, all those different modes of fulfillment.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nI'm happy to hit on the Target Circle 360 question, and I think it's also important to start with Target Circle because we've seen incredible response. We've been able to attract 13 million new members. We see some of our highest traffic weeks of the year upcoming. Really excited about Target Circle week. But importantly, we're making it really easy. It's free to join, and it's easy to save more money, which is really compelling to consumers right now. Beyond that, we've been really pleased with what's been happening with Target Circle 360. As I shared in my remarks, we know that guests shop a lot of different stores in retail. You saw that 4.2 trillion market share. People shop a lot of different places.\nFor us today with 360, the ability to get same day delivery from Target, but also 100 other retailers with our partners at Shipt, is differentiated today in the marketplace. We're also going to continue to be really consumer focused and focused on what Target guests want from Target. I mentioned a few of the things that we're going to continue to add. We are not looking to compare ourselves. We're actually looking to look to our member base to say what can we do to actually make it easier for them to get the best of Target every time they interact with us?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI see the clock is run out. I do want to thank everyone for joining us as we wrap up today. You know, I'd share with you personally. I've been sitting in this chair for 11 years now, and we've gone through different cycles. We've lived through pandemics. We've seen record-high, 30-year-high inflation, no changes in the consumer environment. But sitting here today, I would tell all of you, I don't think I've ever been more excited nor more confident about the direction we're headed. We shared a lot of that with you today. But I always start, Rick, with product, and I think we have this very unique assortment of amazing national brand partners, our own brands, emerging brands, and then those partnerships that we announced just this week.\nYou know what we do at Disney and Marvel, what we're going to do with Champion going forward. We're a destination for partnership. We're a place people want to do business. Kerry, you've talked a lot today about the work we've done from a digital standpoint, how we're integrating social in everything we do, the excitement we have about the future of Roundel, Target Plus, what we can do with Target Circle 360.\nAnd then Michael, just the fundamentals we constantly come back to and running 2,000 great stores with more to come, making sure that we continue to become more reliable, more consistent. We see tremendous upside as a team. And I can't tell you how much pride I have in the team that's here and the 400,000 team members that wake up every day thinking about how they serve our guests throughout the country. Thanks so much for joining us. We look forward to seeing you throughout the year and appreciate your attention today, so thank you."

Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who will be listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. Finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our investor relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on Q2 and his priorities for Q3 and beyond. Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my remarks today by welcoming Rick Gomez to this call, following his recent move into the role of Chief Commercial Officer. This change was one of several we announced in June, including Christina Hennington's move into the role of Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, and Lisa Roath's transition into the role of Chief Merchandising Officer of Food, Essentials, and Beauty. Lisa has done a fantastic job leading our marketing team, and I've asked her to remain in that role until early 2025. This will provide adequate time for us to complete an external search for her successor before Lisa brings her impressive commercial leadership experience back into the merchandising team. These changes follow our January announcement that Michael would move into the pivotal role of our Chief Operating Officer.\nMichael took on the CFO role just before the pandemic, and he's done an outstanding job leading the company through a period of unprecedented growth and volatility. The search for Michael's replacement as CFO is ongoing, and I share Michael's excitement for the time when he's able to fully focus on his new role leading all of our operational functions. Of course, we were pleased this month to welcome Amy Tu into the role of Chief Legal and Compliance Officer. During her career, Amy has served in key leadership roles for several Fortune 100 companies, and I'm excited to welcome her to the Target team. Amy is taking the place of Don Liu on our team as he prepares for his retirement. I want to pause and thank Don for his many years of thoughtful and conscientious service to Target and our stakeholders.\nHe is an outstanding leader who has served as a trusted partner to me, to our board, and our entire leadership team during his tenure here at Target. All of these changes on our team are just the latest evidence of our focus on developing enterprise leaders, ones who go well beyond subject matter expertise to develop strong leadership skills with a foundation based on a comprehensive understanding of our business and how we fit into the broader landscape. As you've seen from our second quarter results, the strength of our entire team was clearly evident in our financial performance, which came in well above our expectations. On the top line, we met our goal of returning to growth but moved well beyond that baseline expectation. More specifically, our Q2 comparable sales grew 2% at the very top end of our guidance range.\nOn the bottom line for the quarter, our EPS of $2.57 was well above the high end of our guidance, representing growth of more than 42% over last year. Among the drivers of our comp sales, we're pleased that our second quarter growth was driven entirely by traffic, reflecting the combined benefits of the multiple guest-focused initiatives we outlined in our financial community meeting back in March. It's also notable that our store and digital channels both saw growth in Q2. Our digital team has done an outstanding job of enhancing our digital experience, and that's showing through in our business results. We saw high single-digit growth in our digital comps in Q2 and even faster growth in same-day services led by Drive Up and Target Circle 360, both of which grew in the low teens.\nSame-day services now account for more than two-thirds of our digital sales, with the biggest contribution from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in Q2 and more than $4 billion so far this year. Our balanced multi-category merchandising assortment continues to resonate with our guests as trends strengthened across the board in Q2, and we were particularly encouraged to see discretionary category trends improve for the fourth consecutive quarter. In apparel, comp sales grew by more than 3%, marking an improvement of more than 5 percentage points when compared with the first quarter. Our apparel team has done a fantastic job of incorporating great design, newness, and value throughout their assortment, most notably in our All in Motion brand, which delivered growth in the low teens.\nBeauty was another standout as the category continued to gain share with comp growth of 9% in Q2, on top of double-digit growth a year ago. On the frequency side of our assortment, both our food and beverage, and essential categories saw traffic growth in the quarter as consumers are responding to our offerings in an environment where they're focused on value. Over the summer, we reduced our prices on about 5,000 frequently purchased items in many markets, and we saw an acceleration in both our unit and dollar sales trends in these businesses. We're also seeing continued momentum in our Target Circle loyalty platform following its relaunch in the first quarter. With over 100 million members, we're always happy to welcome new guests who choose to join, and we added more than 2 million new members in the second quarter.\nBut our aspirations go well beyond growing our membership base. We redesigned Target Circle with the goal of increasing engagement among existing members, and we've already realized the benefits. For example, during our July Target Circle Week, about two thirds of our transactions were made by Target Circle members. Beyond the direct benefit of guest engagement with the platform, Target Circle also helps us gain deep consumer insights, allowing us to extend more personal, customized offers through our Roundel advertising business. Roundel continues to experience rapid growth based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors. In Q2, Roundel delivered double-digit growth to the benefit of both gross margin and the other revenue line of our P&L. For the full year, Roundel is expected to grow in the high teens on top of more than 20% growth in 2023.\nAs we continue to survey consumers and monitor the external environment, our view remains largely the same as we've been sharing for some time. Consumers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of multiple challenges over the last several years, and they remain resilient today. Given the significant headwinds they've faced with inflation over the last few years, consumers continue to focus on value as they work hard to manage their household budgets. And while they continue to turn out and shop around holidays and other seasonal moments, many are delaying purchases until the moment of need. Against that backdrop, our team continues to focus on providing unbeatable value for our guests. And of course, that starts with a focus on low everyday prices, including our recent price reductions on frequently purchased items. But our focus on value only begins with low prices.\nWhether we're highlighting compelling deals for our Target Circle members, offering an additional 5% savings to our Target Circle Card holders, designing and sourcing high-quality owned brands at compelling prices, or delivering ease and convenience with Drive Up and Target Circle 360, our team is continually working to find more ways to deliver more value for our guests. As we look ahead, our team is focused on controlling what we can control. We're committed to staying on offense while maintaining an overall cautious outlook, a stance that has worked well for us over the last few quarters. Throughout the company, we're focused on retail fundamentals and strong execution. This includes our commitment to being in stock and reliable, even as we maintain a prudent inventory position.\nIt also includes our focus on delivering speed and convenience in every fulfillment channel while providing efficient and friendly service to our guests in every store every day. We're also looking to build on the momentum we've been seeing in discretionary categories, where trends have already improved significantly, and we see much more opportunity ahead of us. We're focused on continued expansion of our operating margin rate as we move back towards and potentially beyond the 6% annual rate we were earning before the pandemic. We're committed to continued disciplined capital deployment. Following more than a year of hard work to strengthen our balance sheet, we were pleased to get back to share repurchases in the second quarter, and we expect to have continued capacity within our middle-A ratings in Q3 and beyond.\nOf course, we're focused on continued investment in our team, in their training, development, pay, and benefits. To support our team, we're making smart investments in AI technology to make their work easier and more productive, enabling them to serve our guests with even greater speed and efficiency. All these efforts are in support of our ultimate goal: to deepen the already strong relationship we have established with our guests. What was fantastic to see top-line growth in the second quarter; it was even more gratifying that it was driven by traffic as more guests choose to make more trips to Target following unprecedented growth during the pandemic. Altogether, over the first six months of 2024, our guests have already made nearly 1 billion trips to Target, a number that's grown by more than 20% since 2019.\nWe're grateful for the underlying trust and engagement behind every one of those transactions, and our entire team is focused on delivering continued traffic growth over time. So now, before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to pause and thank our team. Back at our financial community meeting in March, I described how they were united in their commitment to moving from go time to grow time, and they've certainly delivered and more. In an environment where consumers continue to make meaningful trade-offs, our Q2 results demonstrate the power that comes from the right combination of newness, seasonal relevance, and compelling value. Well, that's great to see. The team isn't pausing to celebrate. Rather, they're leaning in as they focus on building additional momentum in the back half of the year and beyond. Our team is the best in retail.\nThey're guest-focused, and they love to win together, and they're just getting started. With that, I'll welcome Rick to his first earnings call.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be joining this call today, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over time. Before we unpack our second quarter results, I'd like to spend some time sharing my priorities as I step into this role, many of which should sound very familiar. First, I want to reinforce the importance of the areas that Christina was focused on: affordability, newness, seasonal relevance, and ease. These are mission-critical. Under Christina's leadership over the years, we've built an incredible foundation which we can build upon. I've also worked with the team on three additional principles to govern how we work.\nFirst, we'll focus on simplifying processes end to end, including how our teams work together as well as with our external partners, with the goal of driving efficiencies and streamlining how work gets done. We should also be relentless in our pursuit of creativity, bringing innovative ideas to market that are original, inspiring, and unmistakably Target. And finally, we shouldn't be just guest-led. We should be consumer-obsessed. We'll do this by consistently listening to what consumers want and need and then working hard to deliver for them. Next, I'll turn to our view of the consumer, which, as you heard from Brian, has remained largely unchanged for some time. American families continue to deal with a lot. These pressures are clearly weighing on them, and they're looking for a refuge from the everyday stress that they're feeling.\nAnd yet, while the economic data remains mix, we see a consumer that is still willing and able to spend. Yes, they're still being choiceful. Yes, they're budget-conscious, and yes, they're hunting for deals and everyday value, but they're also willing to shop when they find that right combination of fashion and newness at the right price. This was on full display in our second quarter results. As Brian mentioned, the team was committed to returning to growth this year, and they did just that in Q2, with comp growth of 2% driven entirely by traffic. Also of note, every one of our core categories saw traffic growth in the quarter.\nSales from Target Circle 360 grew in the low teens this quarter, adding to our confidence that we have a long runway ahead of us to drive awareness and adoption of this differentiated service.\nIn support of this goal, we recently rolled out a new monthly subscription option for Target Circle 360, allowing guests to get the best of Target delivered same day for just $10.99 per month and only $4.99 per month for students. Within our assortment in Q2, we saw notable areas of strength in both discretionary and frequency categories. As Brian highlighted, discretionary trends have been improving for a full year now, and combined discretionary comps were down only slightly in Q2. This momentum was most evident in our apparel assortment, which delivered low single-digit comp growth driven by newness in combination with strong everyday value, both in stores and online. Comps were led by a performance category in the low double digits as guests loved our latest designs and unbeatable prices in our All in Motion brand.\nWomen's apparel saw growth in the low to mid single digits, with particular strength in our young contemporary owned brand, Wild Fable. Our recent relaunch of our intimates and sleepwear brand, Auden, has seen a strong guest reaction out of the gate, offering high-quality and comfortable items at compelling price points like $15 bras and $20 pajama sets. These results demonstrate the broad-based improvements that we're seeing in apparel, a trend we are eager to build on in the coming quarters and years. While our home and hardline trends remain softer than apparel, we've also seen meaningful trend improvement over the last year. In home, Q2 comps accelerated by more than 7 percentage points compared with the first quarter, and early results in the back-to-school season are right on plan. Within home, kitchen continues to stand out, based in part on our recent launch of Figmint, our high-performance kitchenware brand.\nWithin hardlines, while sales and electronics are still under pressure, we've been leaning into other categories with stronger demand, driving a comp trend improvement of around 5 percentage points versus Q1, driven by newness in the category. Key growth areas include our affordable outdoor offerings in many markets like $1 pool noodles and $10 coolers. Recently, we launched more than 1,000 new items in toys, including over 100 new items in our owned brand, Gigglescape, which now includes preschool toys, games, puzzles, and an expansion into plush. And in case there was any question of the love for our brand with young shoppers, some of the fastest-growing sales in toys are from Target-themed items, including plush Bullseye dogs, kid-sized Target checkout lanes, Target-branded Polly Pocket toys, Target-branded Fisher-Price Little People, and so much more.\nBeauty continues to gain meaningful market share with comp growth in the high single digits in Q2, driven by a balanced combination of new offerings, celebrity brands, and seasonal relevance. This has been the summer of sun care with guests looking for familiar, affordable options like up&up sunscreen, as well as newer trending brands such as Vacation. Minis have also been a major growth driver, with travel on the rise and consumers looking for a little bit of affordable indulgence for at-home too. In food, comp sales growth in the low single digits was led by seasonal moments, with hundreds of new items across snacking, grilling, and entertaining, with exclusive to Target items like Bubly Melted Ice Pop flavor, which quickly grew to be the highest-selling item in its category. We help guests celebrate summer with fun new flavors and items.\nIn addition to seasonal moments, we've also pushed ourselves to rethink assortment strategies that have been tried and true for years. For example, we transitioned our candy aisles, leading into some of the most popular trends like better-for-you options, including lower-sugar treats and wellness candies. While this category was already growing, these changes raised the bar, accelerating comp growth into the double digits. In essentials, which also grew in the low single digits overall, sales growth was largely driven by strength in our health category, where protein drinks, powders, and meal supplements are gaining momentum. Additionally, baby care and essentials continued to do well. Across categories, our owned brands grew faster than the total enterprise, showcasing the relevance, quality, and value we provide to consumers.\nIn fact, because of our industry-leading design and sourcing capabilities, we are better positioned to remove unnecessary steps in the process, which allows us to reduce costs and increase speed to market. Throughout Q2, Target Circle members took advantage of enticing promotions, particularly during our latest Target Circle Week. In fact, this year's Target Circle Weeks have generated the highest digital traffic of the year so far. As Brian mentioned, we added more than 2 million new Target Circle members in Q2, while also adding hundreds of thousands of Target Circle Card holders and Target Circle 360 members. Because of the invaluable insights we gained through Target Circle, we were able to offer four times more personalized offers as compared to a year ago. And of course, those same insights fuel our Roundel Media Network, which, as Brian mentioned, continues to benefit our business in multiple ways.\nWhile it's hard to believe that summer is already coming to an end, our focus is quickly turning to fall. This, of course, begins with a continuation of our back-to-school and college seasons, which reached their peak in the front half of Q3. More than 70% of our guests shop us during this timeframe, and we have plenty in store for them to start the school year off with success and style. Knowing affordability is top of mind for consumers. In many markets this year, we're offering 20 of the most popular school supply items that together are priced under $20, including items like Mondo Llama crayons for just $0.25, notebooks for $0.50, and $5 backpacks. For our college-bound guests, we're offering a 20% discount to get their dorm room stocked, styled, and ready for studying.\nAs we do every year, we're acknowledging the true classroom heroes, our teachers, with a special appreciation event offering an additional 20% off must-have supplies. As the fall season continues, we'll be introducing more and more newness across our assortment to celebrate all things autumn. In our performance category, we're offering new assortments from All in Motion, including our first-ever women's leggings destination with new fabrications and a range of colors, sizes, and silhouettes to make all bodies look and feel their best. In our women's categories, we're leaning into our fall fashion assortment, which includes wardrobe options anchored in head-to-toe on-trend neutrals and showcasing the disruptive value of core items for just $15. New this year, we are showing up for the game day in a big way with mix-and-match apparel items in your favorite college team colors to show some school spirit in style.\nBeyond fall fashion, we know consumers are eager for their apple and pumpkin spice favorites, so we're excited to bring back these fall flavors while introducing some new and trending ones as well. Our fall food assortment will offer more than 150 new owned brand items and more than 500 new national brand items, ranging from pumpkin donut holes and jack-o'-lantern sandwich cookies to Pecan-pie ice cream and Good & Gather turkey stuffing-flavored potato chips. From sweet to savory, guests will find all their favorites and be inspired by what will surely become some new favorites too. While Halloween may seem far away, our consumer research and early season sales suggest there's a lot of excitement around this year's celebrations.\nLast year, social media was ablaze with videos of our 8-foot-tall Halloween pumpkin ghoul, Lewis, so we had to bring him back this season along with several new friends, all with their own sassy personalities and catchphrases. We're bringing that owned brand love to our costume assortment too. Of course, we're standing tall for all the biggest characters of the season, but we're also seeing an outsized response to our Target-branded costumes. With 75% of the Halloween assortment new this year, we are confident guests will see Target as the Halloween destination for the season. As it turns out, which has come out for more than Halloween? One of the most anticipated films of the year, Universal Pictures' Wicked, hits theaters this fall, and our assortment will leave guests spellbound with a collection of licensed products that range from toys to apparel to housewares.\nWe have big plans in store, including exclusive items to Target, and we'll have more exciting details to share very soon. Of course, we don't have to wait for a changing of the season to change up our assortment. In beauty, after years of meaningful investments in cosmetics and skincare offerings, we're investing in all things haircare. New from L'Oréal is the biggest innovation in at-home hair coloring in years, Colorsonic. This launch is off to a great start, and we see big things ahead for this brand. More recently, on top of our exciting launch of Jennifer Aniston's LolaVie haircare line, we launched a new partnership with celebrity Blake Lively for her exclusive to Target line, Blake Brown haircare, which quickly became our biggest haircare launch on record. On launch day alone, Blake Brown had the five best-selling haircare items at Target.\nBefore I turn the call over to Michael, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Target team. The past several years have been anything but routine, and this team has handled every change and turn with grace and a commitment to serving the communities in which we operate. Thank you, Team Target, for all that you do for our guests and for each other. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCFO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick. I'd like to join Brian in welcoming you to your first earnings call. I'm excited about all of the long-term growth opportunities we have in front of us as we work together to deliver more for our guests, for our team, and for our shareholders. As Brian mentioned, I'm temporarily wearing two hats right now as I continue in the CFO role while preparing to fully move into the COO role.\nWhile I'm looking forward to the day when I'm only wearing the COO hat, I'm privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented leaders and teams that are operating with a guest-first, long-term focus that's fueling our results. Every day, I see their commitment to caring, growing, and winning together, whether I'm walking a store, a distribution center, or the halls in our headquarters. There's no doubt in my mind that our team members are the number one reason that Target is such a special place to work. As we've been highlighting for some time, the operations team is focused on reinforcing retail fundamentals following an extended period of unprecedented volatility that began more than four years ago. While this effort encompasses many processes and metrics, nothing is more important than staying in stock and being reliable for our guests.\nWhile our in-stock measures have been improving rapidly for some time now, we're going to continue our work to improve them even more. In Q2, total out-of-stocks were more than 500 basis points lower than a year ago. Also important, out-of-stocks on our top items in Q2, the ones with the highest unit velocity, were more than 50% lower than total out-of-stocks and also better than a year ago. Notably, these out-of-stock measures would have been even more favorable if our perishable food distribution facility in Denton, Texas, had not sustained major damage from a severe storm in late May, something I'll return to later in my remarks.\nIt's also notable that our total inventory investment at the end of Q2 was slightly lower than a year ago, meaning that the out-of-stock improvements we've been seeing are the result of operational improvements, not from simply flooding our network with more inventory. Of course, we're always focused on maintaining the right amount of inventory to deliver on our reliability goals, and we're already growing our inventory in categories where demand is strong. But overall, our business has been able to sustain stronger inventory turns than we've seen historically, something you'd expect to happen given the gains in sales per store we've seen over the last five years. Another area of focus for our team is the store shopping experience, most notably in the front end at checkout.\nWith the recent changes we've made to streamline self-checkout, while ensuring we maintain adequate staffing at our full-service lanes, we're seeing notably faster checkout times in our self-service lanes. In addition, with more people using our full-service lanes, our team has been engaging with nearly 15% more guests at checkout compared with last year. With all of these changes, we've seen a continued substantial improvement in our Net Promoter Scores regarding the purchase experience, with scores related to wait times and interactions at checkout the strongest we've seen in six years. We're also making investments in technology to make it easier for our team members to serve our guests.\nEarlier this year, we integrated GenAI into the handheld devices in our stores, providing our team with rapid access to best practice documentation and the ability to quickly receive straightforward responses to common questions like, \"How do I sign a guest up for a Target Circle Card?\" and, \"How do I restart the cash register in the event of a power outage?\" Since the full chain rollout of this new tool, our team members have leveraged the technology more than 50,000 times, getting answers and a highly efficient average chat time of less than one minute. We'll continue to refine this tool over time based on feedback from our team, but many are already telling us that it's enhanced their everyday work experience, making it easier and faster for them to help our guests.\nIn addition, leaders in our stores are telling us they expect this new tool will be particularly helpful as we bring on new permanent and seasonal team members in advance of this year's holiday season, helping them to become more productive more quickly than in the past. Of course, while well-documented, efficient, and repeatable processes are critical to maintaining quality in a large operation, it's just as important to help our team to stay nimble and able to react to unforeseen events. Our team had to deal with several weather-related challenges in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our Denton, Texas Perishable Food Distribution Center sustained significant physical damage from a storm in late May, resulting in a prolonged site closure and significant product loss at that location.\nFollowing the storm, the team reacted quickly to minimize the impact, temporarily realigning perishable food replenishment for 220 locations with other distribution nodes, while our construction and distribution teams rushed to get the facility repaired and operational before the end of the quarter. Later in the quarter, in early July, Hurricane Beryl hit landfall in Southern Texas, and our team responded quickly to help their neighbors in affected communities. When power was lost in multiple locations, our team successfully kept stores open using generators, providing food, supplies, and a safe place for community members to take shelter and charge their electronic devices. Our team helped to organize and deliver donations of critical supplies to their neighbors while helping to clear debris from nearby roads and homes.\nAnd as always, our team members took care of each other, from cooking meals for displaced colleagues to making sure everyone had access to emergency supplies and shelter. To support these heroic efforts in the field, we maintain a robust infrastructure supported by a core team at our headquarters that's ready to provide communications and support when disasters happen. As part of these preparations, we reserve and pre-position thousands of pallets of critical supplies throughout our distribution network, which can be quickly deployed to affected areas when events occur. We also maintain a command center at our headquarters that's equipped to monitor weather and other conditions in the areas where we operate, helping our field teams to prepare and react quickly to minimize the impact when adverse events affect our communities, colleagues, and our business.\nOf course, we're proud to continue offering financial support in affected communities, having already made proactive donations of $2.5 million so far this year in support of our domestic and global disaster relief partners. Following Hurricane Beryl, our donations helped the American Red Cross stand up more than 10 evacuation centers in Houston. We also supported Team Rubicon as they worked to clear fallen trees, helped homeowners navigate FEMA applications for disaster assistance, aided the Footprint Project in providing solar generators to power homes and medical machines, and provided food, medicine, and other critical supplies to the hardest-hit neighborhoods. So much of our Target Forward sustainability strategy is dedicated to working across the business to address community needs and drive meaningful and positive impact.\nThrough Target's philanthropy and volunteerism, and by integrating business assets to meet the needs of our communities, we aim to be present in ways that help all families thrive, knowing the guests and communities we serve are critical to the success of our business. So I want to pause and thank our entire team for their tireless efforts, both every day and especially during times of need. You serve as the face of the company in all of the communities where we live and work, and you're the biggest reason consumers love our brand. I'm proud to work with you and grateful for everything you do to support our business, our communities, and your fellow team members. So now, I want to pivot and provide a quick update on our sortation center strategy, which continues to benefit our business in multiple ways.\nA critical aspect of this strategy is faster delivery speeds, as local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than a day faster than our network average. But notably, that increase in speed doesn't require more dollars, as our unit delivery costs from a sort center are about 20% lower than our network average. On top of that direct benefit, opening a sortation center in a market frees up processing space in the stores it serves, while delivering labor savings in those locations as well. With all of these benefits, you can see why we're excited to continue expanding the reach of this capability. Just this month, we're opening our 11th sort center in the Detroit market, where it's expected to serve more than three million consumers. By 2028, this facility is expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily while operating in a smaller-than-average footprint.\nBeyond growth in the number of these facilities, our existing sort centers continue to ramp up their capacity, and we're finding new ways to integrate them into our broader network. For example, our recently opened Flow Center in Chicago will be feeding the Detroit sortation center, increasing the number of packages eligible for next-day delivery in that market. Altogether this year, our sortation centers have processed 19% more packages than a year ago. So now, I want to turn to our second quarter financial results. As Brian highlighted earlier, the 2% increase in our Q2 comp sales was driven entirely by traffic. This traffic increase was partially offset by a decline in average ticket, which included a decrease in our average selling price when compared with a year ago.\nAs Brian mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments, leading to strength around the Memorial Day holiday, as well as the Fourth of July, and our most recent Target Circle Week later in the quarter. Within the quarter, comp sales were strongest in June and July, and trends were very similar between those two months on a reported basis. Most importantly, traffic grew in all three months of the quarter. Beyond our comp sales, second quarter total revenue growth of 2.7% reflected the benefit from sales in non-mature stores and double-digit growth in other revenue driven primarily by strong growth in our Roundel ad business. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 28.9% was about 190 basis points higher than a year ago. About 90 basis points of this improvement was driven by our merchandising strategies, which included the ongoing benefit of our efficiency work.\nWe also saw about 40 basis points of benefit from category sales mix, which was largely offset by cost pressures from digital fulfillment and supply chain. Finally, our gross margin rate reflected about 90 basis points of benefit from lower inventory shrink, compared with a 20 basis point benefit in the first quarter. While our guidance assumed that the year-over-year benefit from shrink would increase this quarter, we've seen better-than-expected results in our most recent store inventory counts, resulting in a bigger-than-expected financial benefit in Q2. Based on these updated counts, we're now expecting our Q3 gross margin rate will also benefit from lower shrink costs, but expect the magnitude of that benefit will be less than half of what we just experienced in the second quarter.\nFor Q4, given the financial benefit we were already seeing a year ago, we're expecting shrink costs will be approximately flat to last year. While it's encouraging to see this progress, we'll continue our work to move shrink rates down to more sustainable levels in the years ahead, given the steep increase in shrink that our business has absorbed over the last five years. Our second quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.2% was about 30 basis points higher than a year ago. This increase reflected cost increases in multiple parts of our business, along with continued investments in our team, which were partially offset by lower remodel expenses, savings from our efficiency work, and continued disciplined cost management throughout the enterprise.\nOverall, our Q2 operating margin rate of 6.4% was about 160 basis points higher than last year, as we continue to build back our profitability from the significant headwinds we've encountered over the last couple of years. Regarding our inventory, we continue to feel good about our position. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 ending inventory on the balance sheet was slightly lower than a year ago. However, given all of the volatility we've experienced since the pandemic began, one-year comparisons can be hard to interpret. As such, we still find it useful to compare relative growth rates back to 2019. If you perform that comparison for the second quarter, you'll see that both our sales and ending inventory have grown about 38% over those five years, reinforcing our view that we're positioned appropriately as we enter the back half of the year.\nNow I'd like to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our long-standing priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we look to support the dividend and build on our more than 50-year record of increasing the annual dividend. And finally, we look to return any excess cash that's available after these first two uses by engaging in share repurchases over time within the limits of our investment-grade credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we've allocated $1.3 billion to capital expenditures through the first half of the year and continue to expect full-year CapEx in the $3 to 4 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we returned $509 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in Q2, representing growth of about $10 million over last year.\nFinally, we returned to share repurchases in the second quarter, allocating $155 million to retire 1.1 million shares of our stock. Given the work of our team to strengthen our balance sheet over the last 18 months and the simultaneous improvements we've seen in our profitability and cash flow, we were happy to get back to repurchases this quarter. We expect to have continued repurchase capacity in the back half of 2024 and in the years ahead. So now, I want to end my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which is an important measure of the quality of both our financial results and our capital investments. Through the 12 months ending in the second quarter, our after-tax ROIC of 16.6% was nearly 3 percentage points higher than a year ago.\nWhile this is already a very strong after-tax return, our long-term financial plans envision continued growth of this metric into the high teens over time. Now I'd like to turn to our expectations for Q3 and the full year. While our performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities, the macroeconomic backdrop, consumer data, and our business remains unusually high. Against that backdrop, our experience over the last several years has shown us that a prudent outlook while maintaining the team's agility is the best way to position our business. As such, we've taken a measured approach to our forward-looking guidance, and our team remains ready to respond if the pace of our business turns out to be stronger.\nWith these considerations as context, we're planning for Q3 comparable sales growth in the 0% to 2% range and GAAP and adjusted EPS of $2.10 to 2.40. While our full-year comp guidance range remains the same at 0% to 2% growth and the breadth of possibilities remains quite wide, our baseline plan for the fall season would put us in the lower half of that range for the full year. However, in light of the strong financial performance our business has already delivered in the first half of the year, we've raised our full-year GAAP and adjusted EPS range to $9 to 9.70, compared with our prior range of $8.60 to 9.60. At our financial community meeting earlier this year, we provided insight into our financial aspirations over the next 10 years.\nAt their core, those aspirations are based on two basic assumptions: healthy growth on the top line and reaching the appropriate level of profitability on the bottom line. In the second quarter, in an environment where consumers are focused on value and making tough trade-offs in their spending decisions, our team delivered newness, value, and reliability to our guests, resulting in top-line growth beyond our baseline expectations and even faster growth in guest traffic. Importantly, even in a challenging environment, we also expanded our Q2 operating margin rate. We are really proud of these results, which reflect the hard work and dedication of our outstanding team. At the same time, this quarter was only the first step on a much longer journey, and we have a lot more work ahead of us.\nMore specifically, with 2019 as a baseline, the second quarter was the first time in a while in which our EPS grew faster than the top line, with total revenue growth of 38% over that five-year period and EPS growth of more than 41%. Our guidance for the remainder of the year implies further expansion of both of those metrics. Based on our growth initiatives, ongoing efficiency work, and continued opportunity to reduce the impact of inventory shrink, we expect to see additional progress in the years ahead. We have a clear vision of how we're going to get there and the right team in place to make it happen. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to spend a minute on a concept we've touched on before, which is the way we uniquely leverage the power of and in our business. The reason Target is so unique and why we've developed such a special bond with consumers is because we offer something different than everyone else in the marketplace. We offer great prices, convenience, compelling promotions, and a great shopping experience. Our nearly 2,000 stores are accessible to the vast majority of the US population, and we have a comprehensive suite of fast and convenient digital fulfillment options. For a destination in discretionary categories like apparel, home, and hardlines, in frequency categories like essentials and food and beverage, and in beauty, which perfectly straddles both.\nWe offer a broad range of items, serve as a convenient one-stop shop, and we're well-known for curating our merchandise assortment. We are a style leader. We're known for celebrating seasonal moments, and we offer reliability on everyday wants and needs. When we're at our best, we achieve a proper balance between all of those aspects of our go-to-market strategy, and the second quarter was a textbook example of Target being Target. I'm incredibly proud of our team for delivering better-than-expected results in an environment where consumers are facing multiple challenges. Knowing there's more work to be done, our team is on their front foot and ready to deliver more for our guests in the third quarter and beyond. Our team's positive energy is contagious, and I look forward to working with them as they continue to move Target forward in the quarters and years ahead.\nSo with that, we'll move to Q&A. Rick, Michael, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. To withdraw your request, press star two. Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned that you haven't seen a notable change in the consumer versus what you've seen year to date. Can you help us understand or reconcile your ability to get to the high end of the guidance range for Q2, maintain the guidance range for Q3, but also flag that you are likely to get to the lower end for the same store sales guidance range for the year?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCFO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Kate. I think the headline is at the start of your question. We see a consumer that's largely consistent with how we would have described the consumer over the last couple of quarters. A consumer that's been resilient overall in their spending in spite of significant inflation over the last couple of years. A consumer that's choiceful. And so our combination of getting newness and value right in the second quarter led to the performance that was at the top end of our expectations. And as we look at the balance of the year, we've got more of the year in front of us than is behind us, and we think it's prudent to take a measured view against the kind of consumer behaviors we'll be watching over the balance of the year. But importantly, that guidance is still centered on growth.\nWe expect to continue to grow in Q3. We expect to have a growth story for the year, and you can see us playing offense appropriately against that goal, but being measured in our outlook. We think that's the right way to position the business.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nKate, just to build on Michael's comments, I think in this environment where there is so much consumer uncertainty, we're taking the appropriate approach to guidance in the third quarter. But as you heard from Rick and from Michael, we're continuing to play to win, and we feel very good about how we're prepared for the big seasonal moments. We're in back to school right now and back to college. We're excited about Halloween, and Rick and his team are planning for some unique moments during the holiday season. So I don't want anyone to be confused with what we think is the appropriate outlook for the third quarter, but the fact that we're going to continue to play offense.\nWe're going to look to drive traffic into our stores and business to our site and make sure we deliver great value along with newness for our guests throughout the season.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So I just wanted to go back to the operating margin performance during the quarter. We saw a very strong delivery during the quarter. How do you feel about the sustainability of the improvement and then over time getting back to that 6% plus margins on an annual basis?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCFO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. As we laid out at the start of the year, this year was going to be about progress to that better margin performance over time. Two quarters in, I just can't thank the team enough for their work to put us solidly on the path of the improvement that we laid out for the year. If you unpack the quarter, I hit on some of this in my remarks, but it always starts with the top line. So to grow the top line at a 2% comp, to see a category like apparel—so we like the margins in apparel—to see that category return to growth helped us from a mixed perspective. Great work by the team to continue to find efficiency within the business. We expected a more promotional environment this year. We've certainly seen that so far.\nYou can see the strength on the margin line due to the team's really hard work to continue to squeeze efficiencies out of the business in ways big and small. And we're pleased with the progress we're making on shrink. Now, there's some noise quarter to quarter about how that will come through. So I tried to unpack some of those details in my prepared remarks. But the net punchline there is we're ahead of where we expected to be in terms of progress on shrink too. And so all of that's adding up to an earnings result we're certainly pleased with. And our work going forward will be to continue that momentum in Q3 and Q4.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRupesh, I'd just amplify a couple of the comments that you've heard us make over the last few quarters and really recognize the focus the team's placed on retail fundamentals. Michael talked about the progress in reliability, improving our in-stocks. Rick's talked about the improvement in value and the commitments we've made to making sure we provide value to our guests no matter where they're shopping and how they're shopping. I think that focus on controlling the things we can control is really helping us improve our operating margin performance. The team has been very focused on retail fundamentals execution each and every day, both from a physical standpoint and a digital standpoint. I think you're seeing the benefits of that pay off.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. I'll pass it along.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning. So my first question is, can you talk more specifically about what drove the strength in the merchandise margin strategies in the second quarter? And what are you embedding in the back half in terms of sustainability?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCFO and COO, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. There's a lot that goes into that margin line on any quarter. And so the headlines are some we've touched on a little bit already. We've definitely seen a more promotional environment. But against that backdrop, the teams have worked hard to find efficiencies within the business. And that can show up in ways big and small. To give a tangible example, one of the things that we've continued to see progress with is the most expensive thing we do in fulfilling product is shipping a brown box. And we've seen significant improvement in the cost per unit of that activity as teams have worked to better align inventory with where we see demand. So we have to split shipments less frequently.\nThe core productivity within those processes, big improvements in our stores team delivering that product more efficiently as we pick and pack in the stores. And so that work adds up, and the teams have been at it for multiple quarters now, and we're seeing it pay off.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Then on the top line, I was just curious how you forecast the business. Obviously, the consumer has been a lot more volatile, a lot more event-driven. There seems like there was some pause in the back half of July. As you plan the business, do you look at seasonal revenues building off the second quarter? Are you looking at stacks? Are you looking at trends versus 2019? Just some insight there in terms of how you forecast the business.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nChris, I think you've covered many of the things we look at on an ongoing basis. I think we factor all those different variables into our outlook for the period and the quarter.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on a near-term question first. Sounds like comps June and July were relatively steady. I don't know if you've talked about product for back to school. Curious about how the consumer is behaving. And then connected to it, any expectation when discretionary comps may inflect to positive?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Simeon, as we sit here today, obviously, we're in the heart of back to school season, kind of the early chapters of back to college. And as Rick talked about, excited about the upcoming Halloween season. I think as we sit here today, we feel well prepared for those big seasonal moments. And we'll continue to make sure we lean in with a great physical and digital experience.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nMaybe one follow-up. Can I ask about the price investments, the 5,000 items that have been lowered? If so, I assume you're pleased with some of the elasticity. Does it make you think about price positioning broadly? Are there opportunities to enhance the price position in other places? Thanks.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. I mean, Simeon, I think as we sit here today, we feel really good about the way that consumers reacted to the price investments we've made on those 5,000 frequently purchased items. But it really goes beyond those investments. If you're a Target Circle member, you're getting personalized offers every time you shop. If you're using a Target Circle Card, you have the opportunity for that 5% discount. If you're taking advantage of the amazing value we provide through our owned brands, that's just one more way to find value when you're shopping with Target. So it's really a bundle of all those things that we do each and every day to strengthen the relationship we have with the guests and provide them with the value they're looking for in this economic environment.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, and the outstanding quarter. I was hoping maybe from Brian or others you could talk about a couple of things. Target Circle penetration, it hasn't been going up. Is that expected to change? Also, Same-Day Delivery is still, I guess, Target Circle 360, as you call it, is still not growing as fast as Drive Up. Is that expected to change? Would changing these things potentially be a sales driver? Then is there any margin implication from that on the offset?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Robbie, you've got three or four questions there. I'm going to let Michael start, and I'll pick it up from there.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nCFO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Importantly, Robbie, I'll kind of take your second point first. We're really pleased with our Circle 360 Same-Day Delivery business. Both it and Drive Up grew in the low teens. And so we've seen some acceleration in that business on the heels of our relaunch of Circle. And so we're encouraged by that. And importantly, for both of those services, we've talked about this before, but I think it warrants a reemphasis. The thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 Same-Day Delivery is they spend meaningfully more at Target in total, and their in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services. And so we continue to watch that relationship closely. And growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet with the consumers that use those services.\nSpeaking to Circle more specifically, and I believe your question was focused on Circle Card penetration, we see a lot of opportunity over time with the relaunch of Circle to bring some investment back to growing our card business. One of the things that that relaunch of Circle provides is it brings the core-based Circle program where guests can find incredible value through the personalized offers that they receive every day, with the Circle Card program where you can save an extra 5% if you're a Circle Card member, with the Circle 360 program if you want the best of Target brought to your doorstep. The integration of those programs, we think, provides a good jumping-off point over time to continue to reinvigorate the Circle Card business. That's going to be a journey of quarters and years.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRobbie, just to clarify a couple of points. From a base Circle program standpoint, we did note that while we start with a base of over 100 million members, during the July Circle Week, we saw 2 million new members join the program. You talked about Drive Up and Target Circle 360. Drive Up has been a very sticky service for us and just continues to grow. During the second quarter, we saw Drive Up grow over 14% and a nice acceleration in Target Circle 360 Same-Day Delivery of almost 14%. So we see tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our Target Circle 360 program. But I'd really highlight Drive Up has been a stellar performance for us for many years now and just continues to grow. It was a $2 billion business for us in the second quarter.\nI think, Michael, year to date, it's almost $4 billion. So it's been a really important service that we know our guests appreciate. But to Michael's point, we know if they're a Drive Up user, they're going to spend time in a Target store. And we really like that combination.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSounds great. Thanks, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\n\nEd Kelly\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on discretionary comps. Still negative here. What do you think's happening with market share at this point? And then maybe can you talk a bit about when you think that category in total may inflect positively?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nEd, I'm going to let Rick talk about some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories. He talked about the strength in apparel and some of the subsets within apparel. But we're also seeing green shoots in other areas. And we certainly think that over time in categories like home, led by kitchen, as these purchase cycles become ones that need to be replaced, you're going to see some strength in those categories. But Rick, why don't you walk, Ed, through some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSure. I'd be happy to give a little color commentary to the trends and what's driving those trends. What we're seeing in discretionary is when we offer on-trend stylish product at a great price, the consumer responds. We're seeing that in apparel. Apparel delivered a 3% comp, so real bright spots was All in Motion, our performance brand, where the team did a fantastic job on fabrication, colors, and fit. $25 leggings was a fan favorite and really demonstrated the power of fashion combined with affordability. Beyond that, beauty is also a standout where we see new really resonating with the guest. I mentioned in my comments, but it's really exciting to see the success of Blake Lively's new hair care line, Blake Brown. We just launched it a few weeks ago, and it is already the most successful hair care launch that we have ever had at Target.\nI think it's just another great example of the consumer is willing to buy when they find that right combination of on-trend stylish product at an affordable price. Even in other businesses, I use home as an example. Consumers want to freshen up their home. They want to freshen up their look, but they need to do it on the budget. Where we see growth is things like candles, decorative accessories, and throw pillows. We're seeing growth there because we're offering an inexpensive way to freshen up the look of your home. Again, it goes back to delivering stylish on-trend product at a great price.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI'll give you one of my favorite examples from earlier this year. It's a collaboration we had with our partners at Authentic Brands, leveraging the Prince brand. While that brand has been known for tennis throughout the years, we brought the Prince category and the Prince brand into pickleball with great new apparel, accessories, and rackets. We've created a destination at Target for all things pickleball. We know families across the country are enjoying that sport. It fits very nicely with our all-family position. It's just one more example of when Target's Target, when we bring great design that's on-trend at a great value, we see the guests reacting really positively. So you'll see Rick and his team continue to make sure that we're bringing that combination of design and on-trend, great value, great newness into those categories to continue to spark greater demand.\nOperator, we have time for one final question today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSenior VP and Equity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, and thank you so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit about your expectations for longer-term mix of food and beverage over time. That's a category where you've continued to grow over the last several years, specifically since the pandemic, especially as you've widened the assortment and the number of items that you've carried in that category. So we'd be really curious to hear your thoughts around the long-term trajectory for that business over time.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nCorey, I'm happy to start. I'm going to turn it over to Rick, who obviously was leading our food and beverage business. We think we have significant opportunity for growth in that space, led by the unique combination, again, of great national brand partnerships, and some really strong owned brands that have connected with the consumer. So we think we're still in the early days of building out our food business. But Rick, you've got so much experience in the space. Why don't you share some of your thoughts?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nI'd be happy to offer a little color commentary on the food and beverage business. As Brian said, we believe there is continued runway for the business to deliver growth, driven by a few things. The first is continued emphasis on affordability. As we talked about, the 5,000 price reductions across everyday items was incredibly well received. We'll continue to lean into value on our food and beverage business, not just through everyday pricing, but also through personalized promotions on Circle, as well as with our owned brand portfolio, which offers incredible value. The second thing that we'll continue to lean into to drive growth for food and beverage will be newness. Just going into the fall season right now, we have a ton of new products coming, over 150 new owned brand products, over 500 new national brand products.\nLeveraging those flavors that everybody loves for the fall, I'm talking about pumpkin spice, apple, pecan pie, that will continue to fuel growth. And then the last opportunity to continue to drive growth on our food and beverage business is around ease and convenience. Consumers have a lot on their plate, and they're looking for simple solutions. And we're very excited about the continued growth that we're seeing on both Drive Up as well as Same-Day Delivery, which is achieving double-digit growth in Q2. And we continue to see runway on that going forward.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOperator, that concludes our second quarter conference call. Appreciate everyone joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again soon.",

With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the Q1 and his priorities for the Q2 and beyond. Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. At our financial community meeting in March, we outlined our long-term vision for profitable growth and the broad range of investments we're making to support those ambitions. We talked about our goal to open more than 300 new stores over the next decade as we continue investing in the vast majority of our existing stores. We discussed the supply chain investments we're making to modernize how we distribute merchandise, including the rollout of additional sortation centers to increase the speed and efficiency of our last-mile delivery. We highlighted investments in technology, including AI and machine learning, to make it easier and more reliable for our team to serve guests in every channel. We previewed the relaunch of our loyalty ecosystem, making it simpler and easier for us to deliver even more value to our guests.\nWe outlined changes to the digital experience and our focus on bringing the joy of discovery to the digital channel, just like we've done in our stores for years. We highlighted the value of Roundel, our advertising business, which helps us deepen the connection between Target, our guests, and our vendors. Roundel is already making a meaningful contribution to our performance, and it's the fastest-growing part of our business. We talked about the value of Target's unique multi-category assortment, including the launch of new own brands like Figmint and Dealworthy, and our work to widen the footprint of national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty. We discussed our commitment to making continued investments in our team, in their pay, benefits, training, and more, because we know when we take care of our team, they can focus on taking care of our guests.\nAlso, in March, we provided our financial guidance for 2024, a year in which we expect Target to get back to growth and build on the enormous gains in guest engagement and top-line sales we've seen over the last five years. And today, with the Q1 behind us, I'm happy to report we're firmly on track to deliver on that guidance. More specifically, our Q1 comp sales were just above the midpoint of our guidance range, and our Q1 EPS was near the upper end of our expectations. And I'll quickly note, while we're not yet satisfied with our current top-line performance and we're far short of where we expect to operate over time, we've seen a sustained improvement in multiple business drivers over the last several quarters. This reinforces our confidence that we're moving in the right direction and we're on track to deliver on our longer-term vision.\nAs we continue to monitor the external environment, our view of the US consumer remains the same as we shared three months ago. More specifically, US consumers continue to exhibit a high degree of resilience in the face of multiple challenges, including a rapid rise in prices and interest rates over the last few years. In addition, business trends continue to reflect a normalization in spending patterns that first emerged more than two years ago, a pattern where consumers are remixing their spending back into services and entertainment outside of their homes after curtailing those activities during the pandemic. This normalization, combined with the cumulative impact of higher prices on consumer budgets, is resulting in continued soft trends in discretionary categories, most notably in home and hard lines.\nToday, even as price levels remain high, inflation rates have moderated significantly over the last few quarters, and we've seen a meaningful improvement in discretionary trends, most notably in apparel, where our performance improved by approximately 4 percentage points in Q1 when compared with last year's Q4. This gives us some optimism that we could see a better balance of spending between discretionary and frequency categories in the years ahead. However, given that we're facing continued uncertainty in the near term, our team remains focused on operational excellence and the agility to respond quickly to changes in the environment. In addition, we're focused on delivering newness to our guests and leaning into seasonal moments, both of which have long served as hallmarks of our brand.\nAmong the highlights in Q1, we were really pleased with the response to our limited-time partnership with the iconic designer, Diane von Furstenberg, and the assortment of pickleball equipment and apparel we offered in partnership with the athletic brand, Prince. Of course, beyond newness and seasons, we continue to focus on delivering unbeatable value to our guests. While our team is always committed to value, it's particularly important in today's environment as consumers look for ways they can stretch their budgets in the face of stubbornly high prices. To help our guests in the face of these pressures, this week we announced that we've made price cuts on 1,500 frequently shopped items in many markets, and we're planning additional price cuts on 1,000 more items this summer.\nThese cuts are focused on everyday items in our food and essential categories and are designed to help our guests make the most of their budgets. Collectively, they'll save our guests millions of dollars this summer, but low prices are only one of the many ways we deliver value. Another way is through our Target Circle loyalty program, which we relaunched in April. At well over 100 million members, Target Circle is already one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States, and we've redesigned the program to deliver even more value while making it easier to use and understand. More specifically, we integrated our credit and debit card programs along with same-day delivery capabilities under a single umbrella, allowing our guests to choose from a range of services and rewards based on their needs and preferences.\nChristina will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we're really pleased with the consumer response we've seen so far. Most notably, we added more than one million new members to Target Circle in the quarter, and we're committed to making sustained investments in this program over the next few years. I want to pause and thank our team for making this relaunch a success. It required a remarkable degree of collaboration and communication across a huge swath of our team, including marketing, stores, digital, financial services, merchandising, technology, and finance teams. In addition to value, our team is focused on convenience and reliability, including through the digital channel, where trends have improved meaningfully over the last few quarters. In the Q1, we saw an increase in digital sales for the first time in more than a year.\nThis growth was driven by our same-day services, Drive Up, in-store pickup, and same-day delivery, which have been rapidly embraced by our guests in recent years. In the Q1, our same-day services saw high single-digit growth over last year, led by Drive Up, which grew in the low teens. This builds on the explosive growth of Drive Up that occurred during the pandemic, which was followed by double-digit increases in both 2022 and 2023. Altogether, at more than $2 billion in Q1, Drive Up sales were more than 30 times larger than we saw in the Q1 of 2019. I want to pause and highlight the outstanding efforts of our operations teams to enhance the guest experience. As Michael will cover in a few minutes, their focus on retail fundamentals is delivering multiple benefits ranging from better in-stocks to rising guest satisfaction.\nOf course, our results continue to highlight the benefit of our stores and sub-model, which offers speed, reliability, and efficiency, regardless of how our guests choose to shop. In Q1, our stores fulfilled nearly 98% of our total sales as we relied on our store assets, inventory, and team to support every one of the fulfillment services we provide. So now, as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take note of how our business has evolved over time, providing perspective that allows us to look beyond the volatility we've seen in recent years. In Q1 2024, our business generated over $24.5 billion in revenue. That represents growth of just under $7 billion, or 39%, compared with Q1 2019, the year before the pandemic began.\nWe've also seen healthy growth on the bottom line, where our business delivered EPS of $2.03 in Q1, which is $0.50, or 33% higher than in 2019. While that pace of bottom-line growth is somewhat slower than we've seen on the top line and below what we'd expect to see over time, it reflects some unique profit rate pressures that we faced during the period, a portion of which we expect to offset over the next several years. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2024, our team is focused on getting back to top-line growth. We expect that will begin in Q2 as we build on the remarkable gains we've seen over time. Like the US consumer, our team has shown remarkable resilience during an extended period of exceptional volatility.\nI'm incredibly proud and appreciative of the passion they demonstrate for our guests, for our brand, and their strong desire to win in the marketplace. Our team has long been the key to Target's success, and they're the number one reason I remain confident in our ability to grow profitably in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, while we are pleased that our Q1 results came in largely as expected, we won't be satisfied until we start growing again, which is our expectation beginning with the Q2. Before I share the strategy and plans that we expect to fuel this growth in Q2 and beyond, I want to spend a bit of time reinforcing what Brian shared regarding our views of the US consumer and economy, as well as providing some additional color on our Q1 results. Our view on the consumer remains largely consistent with our view three months ago. Consumers remain surprisingly resilient despite a challenging backdrop of significantly elevated prices compared to just a few years ago.\nAnd even as inflation moderates and we see sequential improvement in discretionary category trends, higher interest rates, uncertainty around the future of the economy, continued social and political divisiveness, and the upcoming election cycles have consumers concerned about what lies ahead. In fact, consumer confidence took a meaningful dip in April despite a strong job market and normalizing inflation. And beyond the psychological toll of the current environment, the sustained level of elevated prices has had a meaningful impact on budgets and savings for many families. Currently, one in three Americans has maxed out or is nearing the limit on at least one of their credit cards. For these reasons and more, we remain cautious in our near-term growth outlook. Notably, we expect discretionary trends will continue to remain pressured in the short term but to normalize over time.\nTurning to our Q1 results, comparable sales were down 3.7%, driven largely by continued softness in home and hard lines categories, and softening trends in frequency categories, with lower unit volume and less benefit from price as compared to a year ago. Amidst the pressure, beauty continues to be a standout category, delivering growth in the low single digits in the quarter. This growth was led by continued strength in Ulta Beauty at Target, as well as strong performance in personal care and skincare categories. Apparel, while down low single digits for the quarter, saw a nearly 4 percentage point improvement in comparable sales from Q4. The performance in young contemporary categories delivered comps in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, with guests responding favorably to our new spring fashion sets, new offerings within All In Motion owned brand, and our limited-time partnership with Diane von Furstenberg.\nIn fact, our collaboration with DVF was one of the strongest limited-time partnerships we've had in years, driving millions of unique visits to our site daily during launch week and increasing basket size by around 15% on average. This partnership demonstrates our continued ability to bring fashion to all with incredible style and value. Frequency categories saw Comparable Sales declines in the low single digits. Seasonal moments continue to outperform overall trends in frequency categories, particularly in food and beverage, and we saw strong performance in both Valentine's Day and Easter timeframes. Sales in home and hard lines continued to be soft, though there were notable bright spots in both areas. In home, the team has found ways to reduce costs in select home categories, and we've passed those savings along to guests. This has led to an acceleration in unit velocity in these categories.\nIn hard lines, the entertainment category grew high single digits, reflecting notable strength from our exclusive offerings of Taylor Swift's latest album release, The Tortured Poets Department. With an exclusive to Target version of the album and three exclusive CD options, this was the strongest music pre-order in our history, elevated by in-store events, including fun photo ops for the most hardcore Swifties out there, as well as the strong presence of our Taylor exclusives on her social channels. In the sporting goods category, our exclusive to Target partnership with Prince delivered incredible sales momentum in all things pickleball. Beyond the quality and value of this line's equipment and gear, guests are loving the apparel offerings in the line as well. Across our sales channels, sales were the strongest in digital, where Q1 comparable sales grew 1.4%.\nThis was driven largely by continued growth in our same-day services, as well as meaningful improvement in our apparel business this quarter. At our financial community meeting in March, Cara and I shared details about changes we've made to our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle. While it is still very early, we're encouraged by the reaction to our April relaunch of Target Circle. In Q1, we added more than 1 million new Target Circle members, with strong engagement across all three levels of the platform. Our guests tell us they find the program easier to use, appreciate the clarity of the promotions offered, and understand the value provided with their membership.\nSocial sentiment is up compared to a year ago, and mentions of Target Circle on social platforms increased by more than 500% versus last year, boosted by our immensely popular marketing campaign featuring Saturday Night Live alum Kristen Wiig revisiting her role as the Target Lady. In addition to these memorable ads, guests are responding to the automatic application of Target Circle deals when they shop, giving them confidence that they're always getting the best deal on every Target run. Plus, strikethrough pricing on target.com and our app helps guests clearly see the value they're receiving on those offers. We believe that pricing and value transparency will only become more important with time and that we can continue to grow awareness of the great value we offer across our assortment.\nAnd while these enhancements drive performance in both our stores and digital channels, our most recent Target Circle week in April drove outsized benefit to our digital performance. In fact, Q1's Target Circle week drove the highest traffic to our website and app that we've seen in the past year outside of the Q4 holiday season. In addition, of the Target Circle members who shopped us during Target Circle week, more than three quarter redeemed an offer. We're very encouraged by the strong response, and we are just getting started. Beyond Target Circle, our team's work to remodel our digital platforms is paying multiple dividends. Newly developed generative AI and personalization capabilities are expanding the scope and reach of what we can offer our guests in terms of product recommendations, search results, and more.\nWe recently engaged in a pilot with one of our biggest vendors to test our latest personalization capabilities, with guests shopping our personal care categories. We're very encouraged by early test results, which showed a nearly 3x lift in conversion rates from personalized promotions versus mass offers, including higher sales lifts across the rest of the category as well. In addition to driving more personalization, we're also focused on growing relevance, particularly where there may be opportunities in our current online assortment. As we've shared previously, we think our digital marketplace, Target Plus, will play an outsized role in our growth in the quarters and years to come, even as we continue to prioritize the curation of both our assortment and digital partners on the platform. In the past year, we've more than doubled the number of partners and products hosted on Target Plus.\nWe're excited to expand offerings with current partners and introduce new brands to the platform in Q2 and beyond. As we've been saying for years now, the lines between physical and digital shopping continue to blur across retail, and we're taking an industry-leading position to minimize the distinction further. In fact, we view digital as more than just a sales channel. It's also the connective tissue across most of our transactions. Around half of guests that open the Target app on a given day make in-store purchases with us that same day. Guests look to our digital platforms for inspiration, helping to plan their next in-store Target run. They use the app while in our stores to check prices, compare products, and even navigate our stores more seamlessly.\nAnd whether they are choosing to walk through our physical or digital front door, we want to provide the inspiring and welcoming Target experience our guests expect from us. Beyond stores and digital, we're exploring new ways to grow the business outside of these traditional channels. Back in March, we launched a new wholesale collaboration with Canadian retailer Hudson's Bay, bringing our iconic Cat & Jack kids' apparel brand to Canadian families in its stores and online. The launch is off to a great start, with Hudson's Bay customers buying more kids' apparel each shopping trip, leading to a 15% increase in their basket size and Cat & Jack T-shirts and dresses among the top-selling pieces. We're already expanding the collection with even more Cat & Jack items that they'll love in categories like swim, outerwear, and shoes to keep driving traffic and sales.\nWhile it's still early, we're excited about the success of this launch and exploring additional opportunities to bring the love of Target's owned brands to new markets and retail partners. Now let's turn our attention to our expectations for the Q2. Summer is a time for family and friends enjoying the beautiful outdoors and embracing adventures near and far. Q2 represents more than half of the year spent on travel gear, and we have all the must-haves at great prices. From our only at Target Open Story owned brand of packing cubes, luggage, and more to this summer's hottest books for the airplane and the beach, we have you covered no matter where and how you travel. For the outdoor explorer, we are excited about our latest offerings in our owned brand Embark, designed to celebrate family time in the great outdoors.\nWhether roughing it or glamping is your style, our assortment of tents, shelters, sleeping bags, camping chairs, and more provide functionality, quality, and value for those with a bit of wanderlust. And for those looking to celebrate at home, we have the must-haves for every occasion, from this summer's backyard pool parties to the greatest red, white, and blue fashion to celebrate the 4th of July in style. As Brian mentioned earlier, value remains a top priority for consumers, and we recently reduced prices on more than 1,500 items across our assortment in many markets. In this summer, that list will grow to nearly 5,000 frequently shopped items, all at new, lower prices.\nWe also took a hard look at some of the most popular products from last year's summer assortment and reduced retails on a wide range of items, including season-long deals like $1 pool noodles, $5 pool floats, and $15 coolers. Plus, guests can save even more every day when they add personalized promotions available through Target Circle and 5% off every purchase with a Target Circle Card. And of course, our only at Target owned brand offerings deliver unmatched value for our guests, providing the perfect blend of great out-the-door pricing and incredible quality. And just in time for the neighborhood grill-out, we are bringing an abundance of new food offerings to our Good & Gather and Favorite Day owned brands.\nWith more than 125 new items hitting shelves, plus exclusive flavors of hot national brands like Bubly Sparkling Water and Poppi, we expect to be included in a whole lot of barbecues this summer. But summer always goes by quickly, and before we know it, guests will shift their focus from fun in the sun to preparing for a return to school and college. Our brand stands tall for families, so it is no surprise that around 70% of our guests shop in our back-to-school and back-to-college categories. This year, we are going bigger than ever in that critical season. Our goal is to help guests celebrate the joy of going back to school wherever and whenever they want to shop, delivering an easy and convenient omnichannel shopping experience surrounded by relevant and new products at unbeatable value.\nBefore I turn things over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams for yet another quarter of tirelessly supporting our guests, our shareholders, and each other. Although they make it look easy, managing in the current environment is anything but straightforward, and it is their passion and talent that allows us to drive great interactions with our guests, to keep inventory lean and yet improve our in-stock positions, and set us up quarter-after-quarter to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina. As Brian highlighted earlier, we take a long-term approach when making investments in our business with a focus on delighting consumers and our guests both today and in the years ahead. This approach has led to outstanding financial performance over the long term, and we're confident it will continue to serve us well in the months and years ahead. Today, as I step into my new role as COO, I'm bringing this long-term perspective with me as I work with my new team to invest in a reliable and differentiated guest experience.\nIn support of that experience, over the last five quarters, our team has done an outstanding job of maintaining appropriate inventory levels aligned with sales trends in each of our categories. This discipline has led to a notably leaner inventory position overall and, most importantly, much better in-stocks as well. Those improvements continued in the Q1 across multiple measures of reliability. A key indicator of this progress is our overall in-stock position, which improved by more than 3 percentage points versus the prior quarter and even more when compared with a year ago. While this broad measure is critically important, the team also drills down into far more granular metrics, allowing them to focus on the biggest opportunities for improvement.\nFor example, our top item in-stock measure focuses on the 1/3 of our assortment that turns most quickly, and we've seen impressive progress on this measure in recent quarters. More specifically, in Q1, the out-of-stock rate on this group of top items was less than half of what we're seeing overall, having improved by more than 4 percentage points when compared with a year ago. We also have in-stock measures for our highest volume stores and our small-format stores, both of which face unique operating challenges. We also carefully measure in-stocks on our new store portfolio to ensure we make a strong first impression when we open in new neighborhoods. And we focus on our seasonal programs, given the limited time window in which those assortments are offered.\nI'm happy to report that our team delivered improvements in each of these in-stock measures in Q1, enabling the overall improvement I highlighted earlier. A critical factor supporting our reliability is the upstream supply chain, where we've been seeing improvements as well. These include the new upstream distribution facilities we've opened over the last couple of years, which have been seeing improvements in their own reliability measures, even as they continue to ramp their throughput. We've also seen improvements through continued collaboration with our vendor partners, where we're approaching pre-pandemic levels of reliability regarding inbound shipments arriving on time and in full.\nGiven the importance of reliability to our guests, these measures should always remain a primary focus for our team. While we're proud of our recent progress, we know we have more room to improve, and we're committed to extending these gains in the quarters and years ahead. Beyond product availability, our store teams continue to focus on retail fundamentals and operational excellence, ensuring we maintain best practices, particularly when it comes to the guest experience. One change we recently implemented was the decision to limit the number of items at self-checkout in our stores nationwide. This decision was made after rigorous testing last year and is intended to ensure our team can provide the best possible experience at both our full-service checkout lanes and also at self-checkout.\nAs a result, when we made the recent change in our self-checkout lanes, we also engaged with our store teams across the country to ensure they are consistently providing adequate staffing at our full-service lanes. With these recent changes and consistent with results from last year's test, we've seen a rapid rise in guest satisfaction scores relating to both wait times and the quality of interactions with our team at checkout. For both of these metrics, average scores in Q1 were higher than a year ago, and we saw increases in these metrics between the beginning and the end of the quarter as well. We're also pleased with the guest response to our most recently launched Drive Up services, namely the ability for guests to get their favorite Starbucks items with their Drive Up order and the option to make a return from the Drive Up lane.\nWhile we receive high satisfaction scores across all of our same-day services, returns receive the highest rating of any service we provide. And notably, the Net Promoter Score for Drive Up returns moved even higher in the Q1, exceeding the sky-high score this service was receiving a year ago. And finally, I want to highlight the entire team's effort to support the relaunch of Target Circle in early April, with a special shout-out to our store team. From the installation of compelling new signage throughout every sales floor across the country and the focus on providing an engaging experience for guests who wanted to better understand our new program, our team did an outstanding job preparing for and supporting the launch of this new program.\nAnd while it's only one of many ways to measure its success, I'm really proud of our team's role in signing up more than a million new Target Circle members in the Q1. Now, let me turn to our Q1 financial performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. On the top line in Q1, total sales declined 3.2%, reflecting a 3.7% decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the impact of our new stores. Among the drivers of our comparable sales, traffic was down 1.9% in the Q1. The average transaction was also down 1.9% as consumers continue to spend cautiously, particularly in discretionary categories. Total revenue was down 3.1% in the quarter, reflecting a 3.9% increase in other revenue.\nAmong the components of other revenue, a decline in credit card profit sharing was offset primarily by the benefit of more than 20% growth in our Roundel ad business, along with increases in several smaller items, including revenue from Target Plus. Our Q1 gross margin rate was about 140 basis points higher than last year. About 1 percentage point of this improvement was in merchandising, where we continue to benefit from favorable freight rates and other cost savings, which offset higher promotional markdown rate. Also in Q1, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from category mix, and 20 basis points of benefit from inventory shrink. As I mentioned at our financial community meeting in March, we've been encouraged to see a growing focus on retail theft at the federal, state, and local levels, and we continue to take our own steps to reduce theft in our stores.\nBased on our recent physical inventory counts, we continue to believe that shrink rates are positioned to reach a plateau this year, and in Q1, the results of those inventory counts were favorable versus our expectations. As a result, we now expect to see a full-year gross margin rate benefit related to shrink, most notably in the Q2. While this improvement will serve as only a small first step in offsetting the significant headwind we faced in recent years, we're encouraged to see this metric moving in the right direction. On the SG&A line, we saw a rate increase of about 130 basis points in the Q1, reflecting the deleveraging effect of a decline in sales combined with the impact of multiple cost increases, including compensation and benefits for our team and higher marketing expense to support the launch of Target Circle.\nOn the D&A line, we saw a rate increase of about 20 basis points over last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales, along with an increase in dollars driven by a number of recently completed capital projects. Altogether, we're pleased that our operating margin rate was up slightly from a year ago, despite a decline in sales. Our enterprise efficiency efforts played a key role in this outcome, resulting in savings throughout our P&L. These savings helped to offset continued investments in our team and pressure from year-over-year investments in promotions and marketing. While these efficiency efforts were broad-based, they included work within merchandising to implement changes in own brand sourcing and design, resulting in lower product costs and other savings.\nThey also included work that delivered productivity gains across our general merchandise and food distribution networks, improvements in middle-mile fill rates, and changes within our last-mile delivery capability to optimize units per package and save on delivery costs. While there's much more opportunity in front of us, the team is already making progress in reducing complexity on the apparel floor pad and the back rooms of our stores, reducing the cost of digital fulfillment while making our team more efficient overall. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to feel really good about our inventory position, which was 7% lower than a year ago, even as we continue to benefit from the in-stock improvements I already covered.\nWhen we look back to Q1 2019, total inventory has increased about 30% over those five years, while sales in the quarter just ended were about 39% higher than in 2019. Given that this growth in sales was largely driven by an increase in our sales per store, an increase in our inventory turns is something we'd expect to see and something that should be sustainable over time. Now I want to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our priorities, which have been consistent for several decades. First, we look to fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support our dividend and build on our decades-long record of annual dividend growth. And finally, we deploy excess cash to repurchase shares within the limits of our investment-grade credit ratings.\nRegarding the first priority, Q1 CapEx was just under $700 million, and we remain on track to invest a total of $3 to 4 billion for the full year. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $508 million in Q1, up about 2% from a year ago. Later this quarter, we plan to recommend that our board approve a small increase in the quarterly dividend in support of our goal to build on our decades-long record of annual dividend increases and move toward a 40% payout ratio over time. Regarding the third priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in Q1, consistent with the expectation I shared at our financial community meeting. As I mentioned at that time, we focused on strengthening our balance sheet throughout 2023 and saw a rapid recovery in our debt metrics.\nAs I also mentioned that day, given our expectation for Target's financial performance for the remainder of 2024, we may have the ability to resume share repurchase activity later this year while maintaining our debt ratings at the investment-grade level. Now I'll close my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q1, our business delivered an after-tax ROIC of 15.4%, up from 11.4% a year ago. An after-tax return of 15% is strong performance relative to our industry, and we expect to see continued growth in this metric into the high teens over time. Now I want to turn to our expectations for the Q2 and the remainder of the year. In the Q2, we are planning for a comparable sales increase in the 0% to 2% range.\nWhile this is below the growth rate we'd expect to deliver over time, it reflects a continued cautious approach to our near-term outlook, which has served us well in recent quarters. On the bottom line in Q2, we're guiding to a range of $1.95 to 2.35. The midpoint of this EPS range represents a growth rate of approximately 20% over last year as we continue to build on the profit rate expansion we've seen over the last few quarters. For the full year, we're maintaining our prior guidance for a comparable sales increase in the 0% to 2% range and EPS of 8.60 to 9.60. We believe these ranges continue to properly capture the range of scenarios we're contemplating, given how the environment and our business has progressed so far this year.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to thank the team for their continued energy and dedication in what continues to be a very complicated environment. While I'm still digging into my new role leading operations, I've been inspired and impressed by our team's passion, ingenuity, and strong desire to win together. Even as they continue to navigate the near term with agility, the team is also keeping an eye firmly on the future and thinking about how Target will be operating in one, three, five, or even 10 years from now. It's energizing work, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve alongside this amazing team. Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nBefore we turn to your questions, I want to recap what we've covered today, including our view of our business, the environment, and both our near-term and long-term prospects. Our view of the consumer and the environment remains the same as 90 days ago, and we're pleased that Q1 results were firmly in line with our expectations. While we won't be satisfied until we return to growth, we're encouraged by the meaningful progress we've seen in recent quarters. These positive indicators include improving top-line trends, resumption of digital growth in the Q1, led by double-digit growth in Drive Up, continued growth in our beauty category, and a meaningful improvement in our apparel comp in Q1.\nThese trends reinforce our confidence that we're on the right track and positioned to get back to growth in Q2. Our team is doing an outstanding job in a complicated environment, planning prudently while staying agile and responsive. Our guests are responding to newness throughout our assortment and continuing to turn to us as they celebrate important seasonal moments. They appreciate our focus on value, and they're responding well to recent innovations in our loyalty offering and fulfillment services. They're also responding to continuous improvements in our shopping experience as our team doubles down on retail fundamentals like convenience and reliability.\nAt the same time, we're continuing to invest in the long term in new stores and existing stores, the digital shopping experience, our multi-category assortment, supply chain technology, and our rapidly growing Roundel ad business. We're exploring new opportunities, including the potential to expand the scale and reach of our own brands through wholesaling arrangements in markets we don't currently serve. Of course, we're continuing to focus on our team, on their pay, benefits, training, and development, because they're the number one differentiator of our brand. Our efficiency efforts are providing extra fuel for all of these investments.\nAs the team delivers incremental savings based on the rapid growth we've seen over the last half-decade, they've created additional capacity within our P&L to support robust investments in our business while also delivering stronger profitability over the last several quarters. These elements position us for continued progress over the remainder of the year and for profitable growth over time. With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Now, Michael, Christine, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. To withdraw your request, press star two. Our first question comes from Simeon Gutmann with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nSimeon Gutmann\n\nResearch Analysts, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. So my first question is, I guess, bigger picture on 2024. We talked about, I think, leaning into top-line growth. Can you talk about the balance of margin and top-line growth that you initially sought for 2024? Are you finding that you're beginning to lean more in terms of driving the business, the cost of that to drive the sales a little more, or are there just puts and takes and levers that you had all along that we just didn't see?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSimeon, I think sitting here today, we've got a very balanced approach to performance in 2024. We are certainly not satisfied with our results in Q1, although they did meet the expectations we set back in March. We won't be satisfied until we see positive comps, and we've got to make sure we're delivering profitable growth along the way. So as I look at the Q1 of the year, I think we see a number of green shoots emerging.\nWe certainly felt much better about the sequential improvement in traffic, getting back to positive digital growth for the first time in over a year, continued strength in services like Drive Up and categories like beauty, and a very significant trendline improvement in apparel. We talked about a 400 basis point improvement. We feel very good about the initial reaction from our guests to the relaunch of Target Circle. We think that's going to be an important traffic and growth driver over the balance of the year. We continue to see very strong performance from Roundel, now our fastest-growing element in our revenue line.\nSo we want to balance that with a continued focus on operational efficiencies, where we continue to see opportunities for profit improvement, managing inventory very effectively, once again in the quarter down 7%, and an improvement in in-stocks, which is going to be vital to our performance over the balance of the year. So we think we've got a very balanced approach to making sure we're leaning into the top line while continuing to look at opportunities for greater efficiency and managing the fundamentals of the business.\n\nSimeon Gutmann\n\nResearch Analysts, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd then a follow-up more tactically, the SG&A related to Target Circle, does that go away, or you just use the SG&A differently? And then the lower prices, how does that get contemplated? Did you also have flexibility in the guidance when you set it out for the year?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I'm happy to take that one, Simeon. I maybe start by saying our expectations on the top line and the bottom line for the year are unchanged, and we feel really good about the progress made on the profit line in total in Q1 to expand operating profit rate in spite of a tough sales environment is an outcome that we feel puts the year off to a good start. On the SG&A line, as you've heard me say before, you'll see noise on there quarter-over-quarter. One of the things that was an investment in Q1 was investment behind the relaunch of Target Circle, for sure. I feel really good about the way the team is managing cost throughout the business, and that's all factored into our guidance for the year.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSimeon, one other point on Target Circle, and I know I talked about this, we talked about this more broadly in March. While we're excited about the launch or the relaunch that took place in April, this is going to be an ongoing effort each and every week for multiple years as we look to build the base program, build greater guest engagement, expand the use of the Circle Card, and dramatically build membership for Target Circle 360, our approach to same-day delivery. So I think it's got to be really clear that while we're excited about the relaunch and the initial reaction, adding a million new members, this is going to be an ongoing commitment every week of the year as we continue to use Target Circle as a way to build greater engagement with guests.\n\nSimeon Gutmann\n\nResearch Analysts, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good luck.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSimeon, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of US Hardline, Broadline and Food, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. How much of the price investment that Target announced this week is going to be funded by Target versus being funded by the vendor community? And is it right to think that now that shrink has turned the corner, Target is taking this favorable factor and reinvesting at least a portion of it in driving traffic-related items?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nHi, Michael. This is Christina. One of the things that we know for a fact and has been a priority for a very long time is the focus on both Expect More and Pay Less. In fact, that is our brand promise. So value, affordability, and how we deliver that is always and has always been important. And as Brian shared in his preparatory remarks, it is even more important during this time of three years of cumulative inflation in these categories.\nSo our commitment to investing in price on behalf of our guests is to pass savings back along to them to accelerate traffic and unit growth over time. Our partners know our playbook. They understand how we go to market, and they're terrific partners in bringing that experience to light, in bringing us great products, innovation, and contributing to the value equation for Target. They see us do that in our own brands, and they help us do that with their brand portfolio. So this is a long-term commitment on behalf of the guests, and it's consistent with the strategies we've outlined for quarters.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nAnd Michael, I'm happy to touch on your question on shrink. If you step back and look at it total, we're managing all the levers of the P&L every quarter, every year. On shrink, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in Q1. As you heard us say to kick off the year, our hopes for the year were that shrink would flatten this year, and that'd be an important first step on a journey to improving shrink over time. And so far, so good on that front. We're perhaps even a little ahead of where we hoped to be there. And that's step one to get to that plateauing place that we're on a good trajectory for this year. Over time, you can expect we work to make more progress on that line in the years to come.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, we get out in front of some of the questions that might be on investors' minds regarding the price investments we announced earlier this week. This is part of our ongoing focus on retail fundamentals, and you've heard us talk about this for a number of quarters now. Michael talked about the great progress we're making on reliability and in-stocks. We want to make sure we continue to provide a great guest experience, leverage our proximity, and you see the way our guests continue to leverage services like Drive Up. But affordability is an ongoing part of our playbook. It's embedded in our retail fundamentals.\nAnd you see that come to life in how we're merchandising our end caps, where we use both our national and own brands, including the launch of a new brand called Dealworthy, the way we're leveraging Target Circle to make it even easier for our guests to get the best of Target every day. So this is just an extension of our ongoing focus on affordability, which, certainly in this environment, we know value is critically important. As we go into the summer season, and Christina talked about some of the great plans we have in place for the summer, we want to make sure America knows that Target's a great place to shop, and we've got great value every time you engage, whether it's in-store or through our digital channels.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of US Hardline, Broadline and Food, UBS\n\nOkay. My quick follow-up is that the outside perception is that Target sales are healthy when it has promotions like Target Circle Week, but outside of those type of events, trends have been a lot softer. So A, is that the case? And then B, does that mean that Target has been losing consideration on everyday essentials? And so this price investment is obviously aimed at improving those periods where there are not events or holidays, and how quickly do you expect to see a response from that? Thank you so much.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, I'll answer your last portion of that question. We expect to see those trends turn around in Q2, and that will be a quarter where we return to growth, and we'll see that fueled by the investments we're making in great assortment, in value, and in a great guest experience. So we won't be satisfied until we see positive comps in Q2 and over the balance of the year.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of US Hardline, Broadline and Food, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. So my first question is just on the trends during the quarter. If you can just comment on the cadence of trends you saw and then any comment during quarter-to-date, and then do you believe weather had any meaningful impact during the quarter?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks for the question, Rupesh. I wouldn't call out anything notable in terms of trends as we moved through the quarter. We saw a quarter that from the top line to the bottom line played out largely like we expected it would. That's a good foundation for us to build on as we move into the Q2 where we expect to return to growth. You've heard us talk about some of the things that give us confidence in that trajectory.\nBut one, I just want to go back to that I touched on in my remarks, is the work on retail fundamentals our teams have done, an improved in-stock position, a huge shout-out to teams across merchandising, supply chain, and stores that have helped drive that improvement. It's just one more arrow we have in the quiver to show up even stronger in Q2 next year or this year than we did last year.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRupesh, on the weather front, while we certainly see some volatile weather over the Q1, that affects everyone in retail. I feel really good about the way our store teams have responded, how our supply chain responds to some of the disruption we've seen. I think we're well-positioned to continue to maneuver through some of the volatile weather we're seeing across the country.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Then my follow-up question just on the merchandising innovation front. So it sounds like your consumers are responding to newness in the box. Just curious how you're feeling about the level of newness innovation for the balance of the year.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah, great question. Definitely, consumers are responding to newness. When they see innovation, when they see that at an incredible value, that's what's motivating them to buy. And so our acceleration of percent of newness has just built quarter after quarter. And you saw that really materialize in the apparel improvements in the last quarter. That was based on the backs of ready-to-wear, our perhaps most fashion-forward part of our entire assortment, our performance business, our young contemporary business. And those are big own brands that we control, design, and build, All In Motion, Wild Fable, A New Day, etc., punctuated by a great partnership with Diane von Furstenberg. And so that's a great example. We're doing that in every part of the portfolio. And Q2 is where we get really excited about the opportunity around summer.\nSummer is a place where we can take advantage of the breadth of the portfolio, the assortment of goods, of course, apparel, dresses, shorts, etc. But this year, we've added a new twist with our frequency businesses, always standing for sun care, but this year, a big snacking and food destination for summer as well. 125 new items in Favorite Day and Good & Gather to beef up the excitement and relevance during this time. So lots of focus on newness and also looking for that from our partners. The more innovation, the more that they invest behind newness, the better it is for us.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. I'll pass it along.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in your private label business with the two new launches that you've made recently and the existing very impressive portfolio that you have. It would be great to hear a little bit more color about the momentum that you've seen in that business as you put more investments behind this segment. Thank you so much.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Corey, for your question. We refer to it as own brands, and it's a slight nuance, but only because we invest behind our private label solutions, own brands like any other brand, put a lot of attention and care into the quality, the durability, and the value, of course. I think you're probably referring to Dealworthy because we've had a number of different brands and up&up relaunch, but we have a couple more to talk about. So I'm going to assume those were the ones you were questioning. We're really excited about early results. It is, however, early. We have a whole cadence of products that will roll out throughout the year.\nIn some cases, we're only 15% to 25% into the cascade of newness, which is why in the prior question, I was talking about how it will build and build and build quarter by quarter as more of that comes to market. What I'll tell you is where we've made surgical investments in supporting price points that were missing from our assortment, the guest is responding right away. Tech accessories, for instance, we didn't have the right value offering in basic cables, HDMI, phone cases, and things like that. When we introduced the right price points in Dealworthy, the guest noticed immediately, and that drove unit and traffic acceleration in those categories.\nThat's where we're doing business by business. In up&up specifically, we reformulated 40% of the product to add quality to the product. Our star ratings and our reviews on target.com have accelerated meaningfully as the guests have taken notice. So we're excited what that means for the future as that builds throughout the year.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, one of the things that's also clear with Target is that strong inventory management helps to unlock better margins. So could you talk a little bit more about your current inventory positioning and how you expect that to unfold throughout the rest of the year, especially as it relates to margins? Thank you so much.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Corey. And you're spot on. When inventories are in line, we run more efficiently across our entire system, and that's certainly been the case in the last few quarters and is the case now. We feel really good about our inventory position as we step into Q2 here with inventories down 7% at the enterprise level. But most importantly, that efficiency on inventory is coming with a stronger in-stock position. We're always solving for both. And that one-two punch of lower inventories but higher in-stocks is the outcome that we want, and it's the outcome we're getting.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. You may go ahead. Hi. Thanks.\n\nMike Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nI just wanted to follow up on a previous question and ask you about these price investments and how much of that was contemplated 90 days ago when you gave your full-year outlook and how much of it is a reaction to what you're seeing currently. And as part of that, can you outline within your guidance what you expect for gross margins and SG&A within the context of the Comp and EPS guidance? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMike, I'm happy to start. And those actions were part of our full-year guidance and our plans. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit more about the implications of that?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. I think the headline is, as we've got one quarter in the books that played out largely like we thought, if not a little ahead of our midpoint of guidance on the profit side. Our outlook for the balance of the year is unchanged. We're always managing puts and takes across the business, but we knew investment in value was going to be part of the recipe for success this year. You see this week's announcement as an amplification of some of that plan.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOperator, we have time for one final question this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nKate McShane\n\nU.S. Retail Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to ask a little bit about the other revenue streams. If you can provide any more detail about the margin contribution from Roundel or Target Plus or maybe your distribution of Cat & Jack at Hudson's Bay. Did you see any increase in conversion in Shipt subscriptions as a result of the launch of Target Circle 360?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nKate has a great way for us to wrap up our call today. Michael, you want to cover some of those topics?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nSure. Those are all good ones to touch on. I'll do my best and maybe pair off with Christina on a few of those. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we see in our Roundel ad business. It grew another 20% plus this quarter, and I think that speaks to the value that we're providing guests and some of our partners with that offering. That's been a sustained source of growth, and we would expect that to continue to be a source of growth going forward. With Target Plus, you heard us talk about some of the expansion we continue to do there, and that's certainly a contributor to growth within that other revenue line on the quarter as well. So we feel good about how those parts of the business continue to add both to the top line and to the bottom line.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Not a lot to offer besides the fact that you can see the expansion in margin over time, and that comes from creating value with our partners through Roundel. And it isn't just about shifting dollars. It's about accessing new dollars because they see the growth that comes with it and our ability to convert that into sales.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nKate, it gives me an opportunity to recognize a couple of our teams for their work during the quarter. And I'll start with the Roundel team. It just continues to deliver very consistent and meaningful results for us and all the cross-functional efforts around the relaunch of Target Circle. I really want to thank those teams and the entire Target team for their contribution during the quarter and their ongoing commitment to getting us back to growth in Q2. I appreciate everyone joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the Q2.\n\nOperator\n\nGoodbye.",

I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting in person with us. Of course, we're happy that many, many more of you are attending the meeting remotely. Brian's going to kick off the meeting. In a minute, but first, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share.\nReconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations, and SEC filings. Which are posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to get things started.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nWhat a beautiful day to go to Target. Who am I kidding? I'll go to Target any day. When I walk in, I head towards the hand baskets. Then I use my better judgment and I get myself a card. If you know, you know, Target, Target, Target. We're gonna get stuff at Target. This is the best day ever. Wait for me, I got a little rain. We're at Target. We better get a whole fit. This looks so freaking cute. I want it all. I just bought the most incredible pair of jeans. $25. And y'all want to know where they're from? They're from Target. To say I am excited for Target Circle, is an understatement. I'm so excited. Anything you need, you will find it. Oh, they did that. Target Deal Days already got me $11 and up. Oh, I like that. Target has some good deals, huh? You see, this is why I love Target. Here it comes. And this is an understatement.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to providing our perspective on the results we shared this morning. I can't wait for you to hear from several of our top leaders, including Christina Hennington, Rick Gomez, Jill Sando, Cara Sylvester, and Michael Fiddelke. While Michael still has his hands firmly on the wheel as CFO, this is his first FCM in his new role as our Chief Operating Officer. I can tell you we're looking forward to discussing Target's growth horizon and how it transcends volatility over any particular quarter or year. Our preference is always to think long term. It's why for years now we've emphasized the durability of our business model and many of you have validated that orientation in the conversations we've had with you over the years.\nOur session today will focus squarely on the long-term thinking that has driven top and bottom line growth over the last decade and positions us for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. You might be asking, why focus on decades? In part because that feels like a long enough time frame to be meaningful. But it's also because we look at longer horizons when evaluating growth potential for investments like new stores, Supply Chain, and other assets. And it's good to ask what else would need to be true for those investments to succeed. So we'll analyze our 2023 performance in that context. We'll provide insights on how our 2024 plans and guidance fit into that vision, and we'll spend time outlining our plan for sustained growth as well as our capacity to react to unforeseen realities.\nBoth have been important over the last 10 years. By designing for steady growth before 2020, we were positioned to absorb exponential growth during a demand boom that none of us could have anticipated. Even now, the country and the retail industry are in a prolonged post-pandemic return to normal, which has been nearly as unpredictable as a pandemic itself from a consumer, social, political, and economic perspective. By staying agile as a team and by continuously refining our approach and innovating, we've been able to navigate this time frame. In fact, if you think back to our earlier algorithms and long-range plans, we're well ahead of where we believe we'd be just a few short years ago. At the same time, we recognize this is a unique moment to clarify our roadmap for growth.\nLet me be really clear. Our goal is to recapture profitable sales, traffic, and market share gains by expanding what makes Target different and better for our guests, amplifying our appeal to consumers beyond our existing guest base, and reinforcing the innovation and investment that drive durable and consistent results for our business and shareholders. So I might start today with the elements of the overall strategy that have been staples all along and will continue to be staples going forward. Starting with our stores, the most visible and tangible proof of our long-term planning and investment. When I arrived at Target, we had just over 1,800 stores that didn't quite cover all 50 states. Since then, we built more than 200 new stores, we've invested in more than 1,200 existing locations through remodels and partnerships, and our store footprint has expanded to cover the entire US.\nWhile retail is decades in the new digital era, on any given day two-third to three-third of all US shopping is still done in stores. And thanks to the stores-as-hub model we invented in the last decade, nearly all Target shopping, including our significant digital penetration growth and our $30+ billion in revenue growth, was made possible by our stores. So if you think store shopping will wind down anytime in the next decade, we'll politely disagree on that point once again. Over the next decade we expect to open more than 300 new, mostly full-size stores and billions of dollars in incremental growth. We'll continue to remodel stores with plans to invest in the vast majority of our nearly 2,000 stores in the next 10 years.\nWe'll also continue to invest in our supply chain and technology. In less than 10 years we've created, acquired, and constantly advanced sortation centers, upstream distribution centers, food distribution centers, and a steady stream of replenishment, technology, and logistics innovation. At least 10 additional supply chain facilities are in the pipeline and will be operating within the next decade. Underpinning all of this is our long-standing and ongoing investment in technology. This includes a leading team of engineers, data scientists, and product managers focused on further integrating AI and machine learning, and driving early adoption of generative AI, all geared towards making it easier for our team to best serve our guests across both the digital and physical assets.\nTake same-day fulfillment. Our initial investments gave us an early lead in same-day. Today, same-day is much more competitive, but continued innovation and better integration with our Target ecosystem means we're ready to expand same-day delivery for our guests while also building on our next-day capabilities. You'll hear more about this from Christina and Cara, including big moves we're making with Target Circle, a program that didn't exist 10 years ago but today has well over 100 million members. Carol will talk about the incredible progress the team has made with Target Circle and where we're headed next. For now, I'll just emphasize the focus we're placing on unlimited same-day delivery through a new membership feature called Target Circle 360, which is launching next month.\nHere's the takeaway. Without huge investments in stores, supply chain, and tech, there is no Drive Up or Order Pickup which were monumental growth drivers during COVID and today. Without stores, supply chain, and tech and providers like UPS, FedEx, and Shipt, there is no home delivery which is ready for step change in guest acquisition, satisfaction, and loyalty. As we move forward, we'll leverage our 2017 acquisition of Shipt to help us build unmistakable recognition for Target Same-Day Delivery. Target's Roundel advertising business is another example of something that didn't exist 10 years ago, but today it's the fastest-growing contributor to the other revenue line on our P&L. In a crowded field of similar offerings, we're punching way above our weight relative to the scale of our retail footprint.\nThe unique relationship we have with our guests and the value our ad business unlocks for the brands that advertise with us are at the heart of Roundel's performance to date. Since our roadmap for growth focuses on strengthening our relationship with guests and converting more consumers into guests, we see tremendous growth potential for Roundel for years to come. There are a number of other points of continuity and cohesion in our strategy, but for this intro I'll focus on just one more: that's the strength of our multi-category portfolio and the balance and stability offered by our mix of frequency and discretionary categories.\nThe way we bring those categories to consumers is a standout strength. We'll continue to build on the curation, the authority in trend and newness, and the competitive advantage and assortment built around beloved national brands, world-class brand partnerships, and a fleet of own brands that drives about one-third of our business and puts us in a league of our own. Ten years ago, our Starbucks and Disney collaborations were strong and growing, and we were building our partnership with Apple.\nThose three relationships continue to grow throughout this time frame, and we added and expanded outstanding partnerships with CVS, Levi's, Hearth & Hand with Magnolia, and Ulta Beauty at Target that drive traffic, sales, and loyalty. This element of our strategy has been a bright part of our future. It will continue to play a big role in the decade ahead, and our team's expertise in product design and development and brand creation and management, they're towering strengths that really fuel our own brand portfolio. Brands like Cat & Jack, Threshold, Good & Gather. They bring millions of guests to Target. They're three of the 11 brands that generate a billion dollars or more in sales each year, a lineup that looked much more modest a decade ago.\nThey lead a roster of Target brands that contribute to more than $30 billion in annual sales plus outstanding margins. For our bottom line, a steady cadence of brand launches like Figmint last year and Dealworthy last month helped keep our edges sharp on the newness, discovery, and affordability consumers crave in the market and find at Target. I believe our own brand capabilities will only become more prominent in the decade ahead, which is why we'll spend time this morning taking you behind the scenes on where we're headed with our own brands. Another area where we'll continue to excel is our commitment to our team.\nIn the last decade, we've taken a leadership position in both pay and benefits, and learning and development, and will continue to be a pacesetter as we ensure our team has all the support they need to take care of our guests, themselves, and their families. So if we start to pull all this together, you might be saying, Brian, clearly Target has some strong assets and advantages and cultivated a great team. But what does that mean for 2024 or 2034? I can tell you our team has been humble enough to ask that and many other related questions. We're not taking anything for granted. There's no complacency about our past success. And while we recognize that a rebound in discretionary spending will favor our brand and our business, we're not waiting for economic changes or a different consumer outlook.\nI've been on the road nonstop since November, walking our stores, distribution floors, and I can tell you the energy and initiative of our frontline team. What they're bringing to our business this year simply can't be conveyed on the slides behind me. This team has shifted to their front foot and they're changing the momentum of our business. Which is why we've seen sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 to Q4. Discretionary declines moderated. Traffic trends rebounded. Our Q4 comps were at the high end of our guidance. We drove major gains in efficiency and outperformed our guidance of $1 billion in full-year profit growth.\nRecognizing that we needed to clear the volatility and the challenges of the last two years, our team buckled down and said \"Go time.\" But in recent weeks, I've seen the spelling expand by two letters and I've seen the ambition expand even more than that. What our team is talking about now is grow time. That's the mantra I hear bubbling up from the front line, all with a commitment to recapturing top line growth, traffic, and share gains in the years immediately ahead. That starts with ensuring our team can deliver for our guests each and every day. A major step is coming soon with the upgrades we're launching in Target Circle, upgrades that will make it even easier to unlock the best of Target.\nAt the same time, a focused list of priorities along with a continued concentration on retail fundamentals like affordability and in-stock reliability will make our guest experience easy and dependable in every interaction. We'll continue to focus on delighting our guests with the products partnerships of value that make Target feel both elevated and accessible. The hallmarks here are expert curation, style and trend authority, newness, great design, and incredible value. We'll also accelerate our progress in omnichannel discovery. We've all seen how shopping is changing into an always-on activity that's integrated across several aspects of our lives, well beyond physical and digital stores. Discovery and inspiration has always been a hallmark of our shopping experience. We started by providing inspiration and easy access in our stores with no barriers between impulse and purchase.\nBut we see an opportunity to do even more, to think differently about the intersection of physical, digital, and social media so consumers can discover Target products wherever they're spending their time. So you'll hear from Christina and Cara this morning. We're going to keep building our capabilities in omnichannel discovery since we see this as an advantage that's ownable over our retail rivals. So I've thrown a lot on the table, and there's more definition and detail to come. Having tackled both industry and in-house challenges over the last couple of years, I can tell you I'm not satisfied and our team is not satisfied with our recent top-line results. We wanted to be even further along than we are today, but we're confident in our path forward and we're eager to share what's next.\nTarget is not just a bigger company than it was 10 years ago. It's stronger, healthier, and more resilient. A company that's flipping the switch from go time to grow time. Over the next hour or so, I'll ask Christina, Rick, Jill, Cara, and Michael to add some texture to those claims. Thanks again for being here. Christina, over to you.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on what you've heard so far this morning, I want to emphasize two key themes. First, we build the foundation for long-term growth with a strategy that is both unique to Target and durable. And second, we're committed to building on that foundation for years to come. So this morning I'll walk through the ways we're leaning into our core strengths, capabilities, and differentiators we've built and refined over time to meet consumers where they are and drive long-term market share gains, sales growth, and profitability. I want to start with an outlook on the consumer, which remains mixed. While there are some encouraging signs in the economy, there are also stubborn pressures impacting families and retail. Consumers say they still feel stretched.\nThey are balancing a lot and having to make trade-offs to meet their needs of their families while sprinkling in the occasional luxury. And yet, their affinity for style and newness, plus early signs of disinflation, contributed to a sequential uptick in discretionary category performance. Over the last two quarters, something we aim to build on and accelerate. At the same time, we expect consumers will remain highly value-conscious, hunting for great promotions and seeking comprehensive value in their purchases. Consumers are also craving stability with small doses of everyday joy. After the volatility of the global pandemic, they're now coping with geopolitical tensions, social and political divisiveness, and uncertainty around personal finances.\nThis all demonstrates that our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life remains incredibly relevant, and the assets and capabilities we've cultivated over time like new and re-modeled stores, investments in digital shopping, supply chain and loyalty, they've all increased consumers' view of us as an omnichannel powerhouse. Those enhanced strengths were built on long-established differentiators like design, curation, a well-balanced multi-category assortment, and outstanding value. Those are just some of the elements we'll build upon and amplify through our strategy as we move through 2024 and beyond.\nThink about the opportunities around something like omnichannel discovery. Designing experiences that support discovery has always been one of our strengths. Our stores are famous, or perhaps infamous, for inspiring guests to discover more than they expected. Millions of guests have experienced the joy of entering a Target store for a few items and end up leaving with extra treasures they didn't anticipate. This is a key aspect of how we set ourselves apart from our competitors, and something we'll continue to build on regardless of where or how the shopping trip begins. After all, shopping looks very different now than it did a few years ago. It's no longer a point-in-time transactional event. Consumers today are constantly taking in new information and seeking inspiration from influencers and trendsetters.\nTarget is already a trend shaper, but there's an opportunity to accelerate this further on both the platforms we own and on external platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Cara will share more specifics later, so I'll just say that our team's energy and engagement in building these discovery-driven experiences are truly inspiring. It's indicative of an ambition to meet consumers where they are so that wherever and however shopping journey starts, the path leads back to Target as the destination.\nWe have long been known for delighting guests through a carefully curated set of products and partnerships. We believe that a well-curated assortment isn't just good for managing inventory. It can be additive to the shopping experience too. Here's an extreme example. Imagine a restaurant with a seemingly infinite menu with countless pages of every type of cuisine and no cohesive point of view. Endless choice creates decision fatigue, taking away from an otherwise joyful outing. Sometimes less is truly more. We make choices that allow us to offer a menu of products, designing to serve a wide variety of guest needs, helping to guide their shopping journey while ensuring a joyful and productive trip. Now to be clear, this does take balance. We don't offer an endless aisle, but we do offer a compelling range of choices and price points throughout our assortment. We think of our assortment like a three-legged stool.\nIt works best when we develop own brands that offer unmatched value and quality, provide the best industry-leading national brands, and cultivate partnerships that enhance our assortment. So let's start with our own brands. We've invested heavily over the past several years to continue to innovate and differentiate through our own brands. And we're not slowing down across the portfolio. We're launching new brands and expanding upon those already loved by our guests. In fact, own brands are so core to who we are. Following my remarks, I've asked Jill Sando and Rick Gomez to join me and highlight how our unique skills and assets allow us to sustain and grow this massive own brand portfolio.\nAnd it's because of these differentiated end-to-end capabilities that we're able to rapidly scale affordable own brands without compromising quality. These capabilities also make us an attractive partner to some of the greatest designers around. Recently we announced an upcoming partnership with iconic fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. This collection will feature the signature patterns and colors that DVF is known for, along with her iconic wrap dresses with a multi-generational appeal and offerings in extended sizes as well as options for kids. This collection features more than 200 items spanning apparel, accessories, beauty, and home, combining timeless fashion with only at Target prices and value.\nOur second priority is to extend our assortment with the best national brand consumers want from Target. Stanley drinkware is a timely example well before became a cultural moment. We were early to recognize this brand's potential allowing us to get a big jump on this trend. We secured great allocations across the portfolio and partnered with Stanley to create exclusive colors for our guests both in the core line and through our only at Target brand Hearth & Hand with Magnolia. Similarly, celebrity-founded beauty brands are taking over social media, and our guests say they want to find them at Target. That's why we partnered with Ashley Tisdale on our exclusive to Target launch of Being Frenshe, a line of personal care products powered by mood-boosting scents and self-care rituals.\nIt's also why we've recently added Lemme, Kourtney Kardashian Barker's new line of vitamin and botanical supplements to our assortment. These trending brands add to the credibility we've built in the beauty space and will continue to support our leadership role in these categories. Our third priority is to round out our assortment with a focus on partnerships which provide deeper expertise and brand recognition for our guests. We've had tremendous success attracting and cultivating these unique collaborations, and in the years ahead we expect they'll play an even bigger role given the incrementality they've delivered. We continue to expand the presence of Ulta Beauty at Target, Levi's, Apple, Disney, and more, bringing industry-leading offerings and continued differentiation for Target.\nLast year we launched a new partnership with Kendra Scott and our guests couldn't get enough. These colorful jewelry and accessory pieces not only look good, but they do good too. With a shared vision for philanthropy, this collaboration shines bright on multiple levels. Expect plenty of new offerings in this partnership in 2024 and for years to come. Surrounding all our assortment choices is an unwavering focus on value, which starts with price but encompasses so much more. We continue to offer fantastic everyday low prices, and we're focused on clearly and effectively communicating our value proposition. One way we've done this is by simplifying our end caps to feature single price points and promotions. This allows us to clarify the incredible value we offer while helping our guests to effortlessly recognize the value, no pains, no confusion.\nAdditionally, our efficiency efforts and the greater size and scale we've achieved in the recent years have allowed us to further sharpen price points across our assortment. We continuously find ways to add quality and newness to our own brand portfolio without increasing prices. Of course, our focus on retail fundamentals serves as a through-line, supporting guests on their shopping journey before, during, and after they make a purchase. These efforts are always in focus, and we continue to deliver a unique blend of physical and digital shopping. We'll further leverage our fleet of nearly 2,000 stores to serve as inspiring shopping destinations and as fulfillment hub for digital orders.\nIn the same way we focus on our store and digital assets, we continually invest in our team. We take care of our team so they can take care of our guests. From providing world-class service to ensuring we're in stock, we want our guests to feel confident that they will be cared for and find what they seek on every Target run. In fact, it was the dedication of our team that allowed us to maintain leaner, healthier inventory levels last year, which positions us well as we enter a new year. This led to stronger profit outcomes, improved in-stocks, and perhaps most importantly, increased flexibility, allowing us to react quickly to changing trends.\nWe're also using technology to reduce costs, increase delivery speed, and improve consistency in our operations. Years ago, we took a bold stance when we outlined our plans to invest in stores at a time when the role of brick-and-mortar was in question. Investing to automate upstream replenishment and optimize last-mile delivery, we developed new ways to increase our delivery speed and reduce operating costs. These technology investments, which increased through the throughput of our existing store locations, helped to quiet the store versus digital debate as we pioneered the Stores-as-Hub strategy in support of the omnichannel services we provide. We're excited about the impact of continued advancements in technology like Generative AI and the additive ways these tools will empower our teams, but we also want to make sure that human connection remains at the center of the Target experience.\nThis is why we'll continue to invest in technology while never losing sight of what makes life rich, the relationships and interactions we have with one another. Just as we uniquely saw the importance of combining physical stores and digital capabilities, we want to make sure we lean into emerging technologies and focus on placing them in the hands of our incredible Target team. And finally, we'll continue to invest in technology to support segmentation and personalization. We love it when guests walk into one of our nearly 2000 locations and says \"This is my Target.\" In the same way, we want to design an experience in which a guest places an item in their cart and says \"This was made just for me.\" This balance of scale and personalization is unique in retail, something we do well and can continue to build on.\nAfter all, we have an enviable consumer base that is highly engaged with our brand, and they shop us frequently across our multi-category assortment, allowing us to gain invaluable insights across nearly all retail segments, not just one or two. It's also why our Roundel advertising business is so powerful. We're constantly listening and learning from our guest base, allowing us to offer rich insights to our vendors, offer compelling and personalized advertisements to our guests, and grow this aspect of the business in meaningful and lasting ways. You'll hear more from Cara on enhancements to our loyalty ecosystem, Roundel's growing reach, and our digital experience aimed at enhancing digital discovery.\nIt's one thing to hear about these strategic initiatives, and it's another thing to see them in action. I'm often on the road to witness firsthand how our guests are experiencing joy through our assortment shopping experience and our team's dedication in serving them every day. On a recent trip to Orlando, I visited one of our smaller stores near Disney World. Our segmentation and assortment planning work let us focus on serving two very distinct segments in this market. One segment consists of the many Disney cast members who utilize this Target store to meet their everyday wants and needs on their way to and from work. The other segment is comprised of families who are visiting the area looking to get everything they need to support their family vacations.\nThese guest segments have very different Target run missions, and yet we're able to provide a cohesive experience that satisfies both of them. Similarly, a few weeks back, I traveled to Texas with members of my beauty and apparel teams. We heard directly from guests about the love of finding all their styling needs under one roof. From cosmetics and skin care items in Ulta Beauty, to apparel assortments only available at Target, to bold jewelry pieces from Kendra Scott, these powerhouse brands have all come together to offer consumers at this store a sum that is greater than the individual parts. On another trip, I visited a store in Mississippi where we'd recently completed a wall-to-wall remodel. We elevated the shopping experience, refreshed the assortment, and even added a Starbucks, the first one ever in this area.\nOur local team is incredibly proud that their Target store has become the social hub of this tight-knit community. These examples illustrate the interplay of our strategies, assortment, experience, and capabilities, showing how we're positioning Target to play a unique role in American retail. So now, before I turn things over to Cara, I'm going to invite Jill and Rick to the stage for a discussion on the power of Target's own brand capabilities and how they help Target stand out in a crowded marketplace. Okay, well, thanks for joining me. Why don't we start, Jill and Rick, by telling us a little bit about yourselves and your careers.\n\nJill Sando\n\nEVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning. I am Jill Sando, and I Lead the Apparel and Accessories, Home, and Hardlines merchandising organization. I've been with Target for over 25 years. The majority of that time has been in merchandising, running different businesses across our discretionary portfolio. Also spent some time in planning and help stand up our product design and development capabilities for our non-apparel businesses.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP, and Chief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nHello. Good morning. I'm Rick Gomez. I lead Target's Food, Essentials and Beauty businesses. I've had the opportunity to lead a variety of different disciplines at Target, including marketing, digital strategy. And then before Target, I spent over 20 years working in the CPG industry developing, launching, and managing a bunch of different Food and Beverage brands.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nWe're happy to have you here. Okay. Our own brand portfolio on its own would be a Fortune 100 company. More than $30 billion in sales and nearly one-third of our total revenue and even more of our gross margin. That's because we have amazing capabilities that allow us to produce brands our guests genuinely love. Jill, let's start with one. I know you're particularly excited about a new brand in toys called Gigglescape.\n\nJill Sando\n\nEVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines, Target Corporation\n\nKids-related categories are huge for Target and toys play a key role in keeping Target relevant with families. National brands like LEGO and exclusive brands like Our Generation have made Target one of the biggest toy retailers in America. The addition of Gigglescape gives consumers one more only at Target reason to shop toys. Gigglescape is important for a few reasons. It's consumer-centric. It's our first owned brand designed specifically for Generation Alpha and their unique needs. It's filling white space in our own brand assortment, and it has us poised to drive growth in a high-margin category. And Gigglescape is priced to be accessible to all families. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our stuffed animals. Most are priced under $10 and soon we'll launch books, puzzles, and toys with all items in our spring assortment priced under $20.\nThat kind of pricing makes it perfect for gifts and for the spur-of-the-moment purchases because your child is being good today. This is a brand that makes our toys a destination, our toys department a destination even when your Target run was, in spite of, inspired by something else. And makes Target an even stronger destination for toys.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nI love them. They're super cute. Okay, Rick. Our frequency categories play such a crucial role in driving trips. And with Up&Up and Dealworthy, we're giving our guests new reasons to choose Target. Can you tell us about that?\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP, and Chief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYes. Well, as you know, Christina, we invest a lot of time listening to consumers to better understand their needs. And one of the themes that we are consistently hearing is the need for value and affordability. So to address this consumer need, we are relaunching Up&Up and introducing Dealworthy. Up&Up is one of Target's most popular brands, delivering nearly 3 billion in sales, offering over 2,000 everyday items at affordable prices. And now we are making it even bigger and even better. We have developed product improvements across 40% of the line. We are also introducing hundreds of new items, and we are offering great prices with the average item price under $7. We're also launching Dealworthy.\nIt's our new low-priced brand with items across the store ranging from socks, laundry detergent, phone charges, and I can't stress enough what a great value Dealworthy will be. Most items will be priced under $10. Some of those electronics items will be priced 50% lower than what was previously offered at Target. Dealworthy will be the lowest priced item in each category, offering absolutely incredible value.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nIndeed. Our frequency businesses are an important part of driving trips to Target, meeting guests' critical needs. But our discretionary categories have the opportunity to do that as well. Jill, can you tell us a little bit about Cat & Jack?\n\nJill Sando\n\nEVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines, Target Corporation\n\nYes. Kids apparel is another area where we have outsized market share, and Cat & Jack is a big part of that. This is the kids brand that we launched in 2016. Today it's a $3 billion brand, the biggest kids brand in America. To put that into perspective, consider this. We sell well over 300 million units of Cat & Jack a year, which comes out to about eight Cat & Jack items for every child in America under the age of 12. This is part of a discretionary category, but Cat & Jack is a brand that drives repeat business for Target because of great prices and great quality, which parents love, and great design that kids love. And when you think about kids style, the success of Cat & Jack pays dividends across our portfolio.\nIt drives trips and sales across the store during key moments like back-to-school and throughout the year as kids grow into new sizes. Cat & Jack also complements brands like Wild Fable. That's our juniors brand worn by millions of teens and tweens who started in Cat & Jack. It's one of the biggest juniors brands in the country and one we just extended into swim. Wild Fable is a great brand on its own, one fueled by our speed to trend in a very dynamic category. But it also has an important advantage since families are already in the habit of turning to Target for clothes for their kids.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThank you, Jill. Rick, let's switch gears a little bit and talk about Good & Gather, because that's a brand that's helped us reimagine our grocery space and experience and really build our credibility in food.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP, and Chief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, absolutely. I'd love to talk about Food and Beverage. Our Food and Beverage business delivers over $20 billion in sales, and that's up $8 billion in sales since 2019. That's because over the last few years, we've been making big strides in improving the Food and Beverage experience. You know, I like to say that we have gone from being a retailer that just sells food to a retailer that truly celebrates food. And in doing that, we have made Target a destination for food. Now, Good & Gather has played a key role in that at nearly $4 billion in sales. Good & Gather delivers a great value proposition, delicious products that the whole family will enjoy, high-quality ingredients with no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high fructose corn syrup. And importantly, great pricing with most items under $5.\nWe're not done growing the Good & Gather brand. Last fall we expanded Good & Gather into new incremental spaces that are important to our guests, like Good & Gather Baby and Toddler. Creating another go-to Target, another go-to category for parents with young children at Target.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nWell, it's abundantly clear that our guests rely on our own brands. Jill, you've been a part of these launches for so many years in your career. What makes us a leader in this space?\n\nJill Sando\n\nEVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines, Target Corporation\n\nWe have unrivaled design capabilities, amazing talent across our team, hundreds of patents. It is no exaggeration to say that Target pioneered \"cheap chic.\" And what we're doing is so hard not replicable because we didn't decide to make a play in owned brands five or even ten years ago. We've been doing this for decades. We've had an in-house sourcing capability for 25 years now. Today it spans 20 offices across 14 countries. Because we own our end-to-end sourcing business, we control our own destiny. When you think about issues like country production and raw material costs, we're more cost-effective with far fewer intermediaries in our network, which allows us to grow our bottom line even as we pass savings on to our guests.\nWe can adapt quickly to emerging trends, which keeps us relevant. We're able to pursue bold sustainability goals, which is important to driving growth by delivering on something that matters so much to millions of consumers. Those sustainability goals will also help ensure both the resiliency of our business model through responsible stewardship of the resources that we rely on and our ability to deliver the quality that our guests rely on.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP, and Chief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThese capabilities, they really do set Target apart, especially considering the scale at which we operate. Delivering a steady drumbeat of newness to consumers. You know, in my previous role in the CPG industry, it was a big year if we launched a few dozen new products. But for our food scientists, there's, you know, that's a couple weeks worth of work in Food and Beverage alone. This year we'll add hundreds of new items to Good & Gather and Favorite Day and on top. And that's on top of the hundreds of new items that we launched last year. We are delivering innovation at scale that is unmatched by others.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nWell, our capabilities certainly are first rate, but that human touch fueled by the power of insights can't be stressed enough.\n\nJill Sando\n\nEVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines, Target Corporation\n\nThat's right. When we designed All in Motion, our performance brand, the first thing that we did was to engage with 15,000 consumers. We talked to fitness coaches, we attended dozens of workout classes because if you're designing for the consumer, it starts with listening to the consumer. We're not just consumer led when we're launching a product. We're consumer led in how we continue to grow and develop our own brands. Because you can't mistake performance for potential. Cat & Jack has been a runaway success, but we also learned through listening that we had opportunities to make the brand more appealing to more guests. Among other things, that led to the adaptive items we created to help all kids look and feel their best, and the expansions we made to our dressy and mid-dressy assortment, giving families more reasons to choose Cat & Jack and Target.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP, and Chief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nConsumer insight has also helped to continue to develop and grow Favorite Day. We launched the brand during the pandemic and we've seen it drive trips, build baskets, delivering double-digit growth year after year. So as Food and Beverage has become a go-to category for Target during the holidays, we've expanded the role of Favorite Day to offer key seasonal items. You saw that in November and December with gingerbread kits, hot cocoa bombs, and a huge range of snack mixes. And just a few weeks ago, Favorite Day was front and center for Valentine's Day. And we'll continue to expand Favorite Day into those big seasonal moments that are so important to our guests and important to keeping Target relevant.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nWell, Jill, this leads to the enhanced approach we've taken to brand management, including a team under your leadership.\n\nJill Sando\n\nEVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines, Target Corporation\n\nWe launched our brand management capability years ago and created an end-to-end process to successfully launch owned brands, and that has enabled an accelerated rollout of owned brands. Over the past five years, we've been evolving our capabilities and are now operating more like a CPG company, the research, the market analysis, looking hard at the white space. That's shaped our decision-making around existing brands, like prioritizing Threshold as our flagship home brand and then offering a range of styles within it. That's critical because Target is one of the biggest home retailers in the country, and this is making it easier for our consumers to navigate our assortment and our brand management work was critical to the success of our new kitchenware brand, Figment, which debuted last fall.\nThis isn't the first time selling kitchenware as part of an owned brand, but it is our first own brand devoted solely to Kitchenware and our guests love it. Baskets with Figment items are 25% larger than our previous own brand offering. Figment was one of several factors that helped us accelerate our kitchenware business by more than 500 basis points between Q3 and Q4, taking us from a negative comp to a positive comp. Guests respond to newness, innovation, and great design, and Figment is just one example of that.\n\nRick Gomez\n\nEVP, and Chief Commercial Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThere's been a lot of work in Food and Beverage to sharpen the focus of our brand portfolio. The launch of a flagship brand, Good & Gather, was the first step. We focused Market Pantry on family favorites at our most affordable prices and we've also retired our previous snack and dessert brand, Archer Farms, and replaced it with Favorite Day, a brand with a much stronger identity around indulgent treats for the whole family. All of this helps Target make consumer-centric decisions about our assortment, like the addition of 50 new F&B items for Easter and dozens more that we're launching just in time for the summer season, including a Favorite Day soda.\nNow it sounds simple, but the thoughtful, deliberate, holistic approach to designing, launching, and managing our brands. It's the difference between rolling out catch-all brands and the difference between that and building brands that consumers love because we're meeting their needs in a really meaningful way.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nWell, thank you both. I love that. And that's the perfect note to close on consumer centricity. That's a theme running through everything we've covered today. New brands like Gigglescape, Figmint, and Dealworthy, our relaunched Up & Up, and powerhouses like Gather and Cat & Jack. So thank you, Rick and Jill, for that look into our own brand work. It really is incredible. When I think about Target's right to win in this environment and our ability to meet key consumer needs our own brands foundational to so many of our plans. That's because the investments we made in our capabilities and our team over more than two decades, combine to form competitive advantage that few retailers anywhere can match. And it's not just the competitive moat we're talking about here, because we're not hunkering down playing defense.\nThis work is our springboard into the future. And through the incredible value we—value our owned brands offer across each of our key categories, and the compelling newness they're adding to our entire assortment, we'll continue to deepen our relationships with our guests, and we'll give all consumers compelling reasons to choose Target. Now I'll hand it off to Cara Sylvester, who will tell us more about how we're getting these products in front of consumers and engaging with our guests and potential guests more broadly. Thank you. Cara?\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Thanks, Christina and hello everyone. Today I'm excited to talk about our guest experience. You might ask, Cara, how do we define guest experience at Target? Well, we think of it as the way we engage across America, from simply saying hello to consumers in a warm-Target way, to deepening the relationships we have with existing Target guests, to how we create moments of discovery, connection, and joy that invite people to choose Target again and again. Before we look back at the previous year and preview what's ahead, I want to ground us in a consumer point of view. Because to understand how Target designs its guest experience, we should start with how people are shopping today. As you heard from Christina, gone are the days when people would follow a consistent and well-defined path from discovery to purchase.\nToday, shopping is non-linear and simply a part of the general ecosystem of our lives. Instead of a stand-alone experience that feels planned or predictable, shopping has become immersive, always-on, and fully integrated into how we all go about our days. A large portion of US consumers, about 40%, start their purchase online and 20% start on social platforms. Those are just the people who are actively looking to shop. Many more are enticed to shop by the inspiration they find scrolling their social feeds for hours every day. This is expansive retail, non-traditional entry points, seamless transition between stores online and social, and fully in tune with what shoppers want and need.\nTo meet these shoppers where they are, we spend a lot of time getting to know what matters to them and seeing the Target experience through their eyes. Our guest base is broad and diverse. In fact, 96% of US adults have shopped Target at some point in their life. Yet we know that your shopping experience and mine are going to look and feel very different based on a variety of factors, our families, our interests, our budgets, our schedule, and simply what brings us joy. Expectations also differ by category. If you're on a grocery run, you're looking for reliability and value. And if I'm shopping for one of my daughter's birthdays, I'm looking for inspiration and fun. These nuances are especially important for Target given our diverse multi-category portfolio.\nYet even though shopping journeys vary, after gathering feedback from millions of guests about what they care about and how Target fits into their lives, there are a few important truths that unite our guests and shape how we design our experience. First, Target guests love to shop. They consistently list shopping as one of their favorite activities, more so than your average consumer. 90% of guests tell us they're looking for quality products. They also want a meaningful connection with a brand, and they're ahead of the curve when it comes to keeping up with trends.\nSecond, our guests are whenever, wherever. However, shoppers using multiple channels to create the experience that fits into their lives. They're in the driver's seat when it comes to creating the experience that works best for them. We have to meet them where, when, and how they need us. Finally, one more important factor that defines Target guests. They are loyal. Really loyal our most engaged guests account for a greater share of sales than we see at other competitors, showing that the connection we have with guests is sticky and drives growth and profitability.\nQuite simply, guests look to Target for inspiration, to find on-trend high-quality items at a great price, and to have some fun. Are we affordable? Yes. Are we fast and convenient? Absolutely. Can you check off everything on your list, no matter how you prefer to shop? You bet. But there are other retailers who can say the same. What makes Target different, what makes guests consistently choose us over any other retailer is how we make them feel when they interact with us. How we design our experience to elevate ordinary moments into extraordinary ones with a carefully curated assortment, burst of discovery and delight, and plenty of human connection along the way.\nThere, of course, are the big splashes of the Target brand that grab headlines, generate buzz, and make people smile. Like our Halloween Ghoul, Lewis, who took the season by storm. Or the ugly squirrel sweater that we created in 48 hours to pay homage to the version worn by Taylor and Travis over the holidays or turning the Las Vegas Sphere into a huge holiday snow globe, complete with Bullseye in residence. But there are also millions of smaller everyday moments that strengthen the bonds we have with our guests, making their lives a little bit easier and a little bit brighter.\nSo when visiting one of our stores in San Antonio, Texas, last year, I kept hearing about a team member who I needed to meet. In fact, even some guests stopped me and said I absolutely needed to meet her. And they were right. She was somebody I absolutely needed to meet. And I wanted you to meet her, too. Let me introduce you to Amelia.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nGood afternoon. How you doing? How you doing, Sunshine? I'm making see Miss Amelia. Just her skin, smile, her presence. She makes us feel really warm. She's really kind and nice. Hey, Sunshine, what's your name? When I think of Amelia, I definitely think of somebody that's warm, that's genuine caring. She even started calling me Sunshine almost. To the first day that I met her. That's how you doing, Sunshine? With Amelia, she definitely has such an impact on the store that she starts. To affect how you feel being here. She just the light out of me. It's just amazing how she can connect with anybody. I see you looking at Ms. Amelia. To make somebody leave with a smile makes my day.\nMaking them feel like they are important. They are important to us. Thank you so much. Have a great day. I would say 50% of our surveys. We're all about a million amazing services that she gives. People come here. They need hope, joy, and a positive attitude somewhere. That lady gives it consistently day after day after day. She knows the names of my grandchildren. She remembers them when we come here. Community and unity is everything. So I believe it helps people want to come back. She even helps my mom when she can't work the machine. She's just really bright and Target. We all can make a difference by treating our guests like family, being kind to them, speaking to them. We're losing touch of human connection.\nI feel like having people like Amelia really solidify what it should be. It makes a much bigger impact than. I think anyone realizes. I feel that I'm changing life and I'm sowing good seed and love and kindness to them. Show the love. Let the love flow so it goes on to the next person. Everybody walks through that door is somebody, and everybody is special to me. It makes me emotional because I just. I love people. She's a specialist. The most amazing person that I've met in this business. You know, I just wish I could go to every Target and just show the love and the compassion that, if you show your guests, what an impact. I know we do it here. Are you recording that?\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSo I love that video because it captures who we are as a brand and what we aim to deliver across our entire guest experience. Our team brings so much empathy to their work. It's not just the face-to-face interactions at checkout or in the aisles. Empathy is infused into how we design every part of the guest experience. Drive Up is a perfect example. The reason guests love Drive Up at Target is because it's a service that reflects what's most important to them. It's easy. Swing by, we'll bring out your order to you or even pick up your return. It's fast. Just tell us you're on your way. We'll be ready when you are. No pickup windows to worry about because we work on your schedule. It's fun. Grab a Starbucks to make your trip that much more relaxing. It's all free.\nThis is what we mean by designing an experience for our guests. Looking at a service through their eyes. Using Target technology to rapidly iterate and introduce new capabilities and finding ways to not only meet their needs, but add something extra to make their day. That's the Target experience. You saw that from us in 2023 as we continued on our path to be America's favorite discovery destination. Our stores are known as a getaway spot, somewhere you can go and enjoy a few minutes or a few hours browsing the aisles with friendly team members to help you find just what you need. We're bringing that same sense of exploration and relaxation to guests who walk through our digital front door. Last year, shoppers visited us more than 6 billion times on our digital channels, looking for the same warmth, newness, and discovery that greets them when they walk into one of our front doors.\nIn fact, more than half of guests who make a purchase in our stores have visited our app or our site that very same-day, reinforcing how shoppers move fluidly from physical to online and back again. Target's uniquely suited to be there for our guests when inspiration strikes because of our agile technology and the pathways we create between stores, digital social marketing, and more. The experience we created this past holiday season is a great example. This year there was clear connectivity across our experience to create a memorable and meaningful visit. No matter how you chose to shop with us, holiday gateways in store and online, digital gifting stations, product packaging to make you smile in store, playlists to set the mood, festive TikTok content, and Target Wonderland community pop-up events. These all work together to celebrate the holidays with our guests in a way that only Target can.\nOur ongoing investment in our digital capabilities enabled this year's fully connected holiday celebration. In 2023, we transformed our digital experience from a utilitarian shopping platform that was one-size-fits-all to one that is filled with warmth, greets you personally just like Amelia would, and delivers a custom blend of newness, trend, value, and ease just for you. It's not just what the guests see, but what's happening behind the scenes to power these personalized experiences. We're using Generative AI to power our product detail pages to provide more friendly and relevant explanations of what guests want to know about our assortment. AI also powers features like Shop the Look and our Get it now assistant, which lets you know when items in your cart are available for pickup.\nAt a nearby store. It's also the engine behind the insights we use to give guests more personal experiences and rewards through our loyalty program Target Circle. It's a key element of how we create thoughtfully curated campaigns for consumers through our advertising business, Roundel. This might be a good time to talk about how Roundel seamlessly integrates into the guest experience and continues to drive more than $1.5 billion in value for our business, growing more than 20% in 2023. Roundel is the powerful bridge between our guests and the brands they love. Roundel works with more than 2,600 vendors to deliver creative that is resonant and wholly consistent with the Target experience. In return, our guests receive content that speaks directly to their interests and preferences.\nTake our holiday campaign with Apple. Tech products top many guests' holiday gift lists, so we work with Apple on a comprehensive campaign to keep their products front and center for our guests this holiday season with custom content designed to reach our guests across a number of platforms, including connected TV, YouTube, and social media. Our co-created holiday video ad made us the first Apple partner to highlight the new Double Tap feature on its Watch Series 9 in a spot. To add relevance, we used AI on our site to position the right products in the right moments. Think serving up promotions to RedCard holders so they get the best deal plus extra 5% off by using their card or helping a guest find the perfect gift for their teenager. Hint: go for the AirPods Pro.\nThis integrated campaign tapped into our powerful ecosystem of digital social marketing and merchandising and absolutely resonated with shoppers. We deepened relationships with existing fans and attracted new ones with a significantly higher new guest rate compared to prior Apple campaigns at Target. In addition to the way Roundel powers the guest experience when guests are browsing our app or website, unique to Target is our media mix. With 35% of revenue being generated outside of our own properties. That means that we're able to connect with consumers wherever they are, like on social or streaming platforms. Platforms driving more than 250 million visits to Target properties in 2023, and social is increasingly where our guests are. We have more followers than any other mass retailer on TikTok with incredibly high engagement, which underscores our opportunity to connect the love that guests have for us on social to a smooth path to purchase in stores and on our digital properties.\nOur guests use social to stay in touch with the latest trends in a way that feels specifically designed for them. So we're working across the spectrum of social from user-generated content and Target creators to our talent partners and Target-owned platforms to make it easier for guests to maintain that discovery mindset as they shop. Over the coming year, you'll see us experimenting to bring off-platform content onto our digital properties so guests can find inspiration right on our site, in our app, and we'll blend social and commerce to create an experience that taps into real-time trends and makes offline inspiration to online purchase intuitive and easy. So imagine a guest looking for just the right things for a housewarming celebration. They open our app, which is personalized just for them, and type in housewarming party ideas.\nUsing Generative AI search they see the latest products that fit their style and preferences, including delicious snacks from Good & Gather, cheap party supplies, modern glassware, and even some new party outfits. We brought the fun of wandering the aisles of our stores alongside inspiration from lifestyle influencers to spark new finds like beautiful living room decor. Our guest uses 3D visualization to see it in their space and AI-powered reviews to learn more. They love it and snap it up along with their must-have party supplies within a few hours. Their haul arrives thanks to same-day delivery. They love the items so much they share their finds on social media, inspiring other guests to shop Target. This is the future our teams are working on today. A seamless, fluid shopping experience across stores, digital, and social and centered on what our guests want and need.\nKnowing what our guests want and need, deepening our connection with them and making millions of guests feel that every visit is made just for them is at the heart of our loyalty program, Target Circle. We introduced the program in 2019 as a way to say thank you to guests with deals, rewards, and perks. Today we have more than 100 million members who have earned $2 billion in rewards. Members have told us how much they value the program and it shows. Last year, they visited us five times more often and spent five times more than guests who aren't members of Target Circle yet. Our personalized deals and bonus offers, powered by our proprietary technology, drove $1.5 billion in incremental sales last year. Yet members have also told us that it could be even easier to save and know how much they're saving.\nSo we took this opportunity not just to improve our program, but to reimagine how we think about loyalty across the entirety of our experience. So today I am thrilled to introduce a new Target Circle, one that brings the best of Target together under one loyalty program. Here's a short video that we created to sum up what's new and what's next.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nSince Target's inception, we've been focused on loyalty and really deepening the relationships that we have with our guest. More than 30 years ago, we debuted our Target RedCard credit card. We took another step forward in 2019. Introducing our formal loyalty program, Target Circle. Target Circle allows us to connect with guests and have a two-way relationship where we really get to understand you and we're able to deliver personalized deals, offers, and an experience that's just right for you. We knew we needed to evolve Target Circle by listening directly to our guest. We listen deeply.\nThe reality is that we have some friction in the program today. So we are leaning into each other. We want all of our guests to feel welcome and appreciated each and every time that they shop with us. The upgraded Target Circle experience allows. Us to do just that we know our guests like Target Circle. But our ambition is to have our guests love Target Circle. That is why we're bringing three programs together. We are investing in ease and simplicity within Target Circle. Scan your app at checkout and you get deals automatically. We are investing an instant 5% savings. Free two-day shipping, extended return windows in Target Circle Card.\nAnd then we are bringing unlimited same-day delivery in as little as an hour to our guests within Target Circle 360. By evolving and upgrading our experience, we're going to make it even easier for our guests to interact with Target in a way that feels right for them. We're confident with the relaunch of Target Circle that not only will our current guests shop us more often, but we're well positioned to welcome even more new shoppers to Target. It really is the best way to get more Target. Reimagining Target Circle is one of the biggest initiatives for us as a company in the next year and really accelerates the company's next phase of growth.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSo bringing together Target Circle, Target Circle Card, and Target Circle 360 simplifies and expands how we deliver value to our guests. And as we've been talking about, we've designed the program to give guests flexibility and control in how they shop. There's the Target Circle our guests know and love today that gives every member access to the best deals and rewards at Target. There's absolutely no cost to join. What's new is they can now shop Target without having to search for and add offers. Deals are automatically applied at checkout, plus they'll continue to receive partner perks with Ulta Beauty and Apple, and even more rewards through personalized bonuses based on their shopping behavior. For those guests who want to save even more, Target Circle Card offers an extra 5% off each trip. This is on top of the automatic savings they receive as Target Circle members.\nPlus free two-day shipping, extended time for returns, and no annual fee. With credit card, debit card, or reloadable card options, consumers can find the product that's right for them. Finally, for those who want the magic of Target delivered to their door in as little as one hour, there's Target Circle 360, an extension of the same-day capabilities we've built since our acquisition of Shipt in 2017. Target Circle 360 members can order everything from groceries to household essentials to the newest must-have item with no additional fees, no markups, and support from a preferred shopper. Members even have access to Shipt's multi-retailer marketplace, which gives them access to even more items from their favorite local stores.\nNo waiting for days for boxes to arrive on your doorstep, just unlimited same-day delivery that we're rolling out to guests at the promotional price of $49, which will be the standard price for Target Circle Card holders. Guests will have access to the new Target Circle starting 7th April, and we can't wait for them to feel the difference. This is just the beginning for Target Circle. Our AI-powered models will continue to deepen our relationship with guests and enable us to deliver one-on-one personalization at scale. With this new foundation in place, we'll continue adding benefits and perks based on what matters most to our guests, like exclusive partnerships, product offers, and more, so they can get the most out of shopping at Target. This goes back full circle, pun intended, to how people are shopping today.\nShopping is dynamic and so are we. The investments we're making reflect our focus on consumers' preferences and needs, so we continue to be their first choice for discovery, delight, and experiences that make them smile. That's Target's guest experience at its best, building connection and celebrating everyday moments in meaningful and memorable ways. Moving with our guests through their lives so we're able to bring joy whenever we can. That's the Target magic and it's what fuels our future. Now I'd like to welcome a familiar face with an expanded title to the stage, Michael Fiddelke.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks and good morning everyone. As Cara just mentioned, I've recently taken on a new role and while I'll be staying on as CFO for a little while longer, I'm honored and excited to be leading our incredible operations team as Chief Operating Officer. As an engineer by training, I've always had a passion and respect for the work of my new team and I've learned a lot working with them and alongside them during my 20-plus years at Target. As John Hulbert would tell you, over the years, I've often added complexity to our investor travel so we could squeeze in just one more store visit. Throughout the recent holiday season and so far this new year, it's been great to have an opportunity to spend even more time with teams in both our stores and supply chain facilities.\nWhile our financial conversations are often focused on the metrics we use to assess our performance, there's no substitute for seeing firsthand the strength of our operations, the benefits that come from well-managed inventory and newness, and hearing what our talented team is focused on building for the future. So before I move into the financial portion of my remarks, I'm going to spend a few minutes on my priorities as I move into this new role. As I've mentioned to my new team, I'm coming into this job at a time when our operations are in a very strong position. As such, my top priority is to build on the foundation that John Mulligan and the team have already established, and I'm fortunate to have an outstanding group of leaders already in place.\nAs you've heard from John over the years, the operations team is focused on advancing multiple long-term initiatives to expand our footprint, modernize how we support our business, and advance our company strategy. These efforts begin with investments in our store network, developing new locations, remodeling existing ones, supporting key partnerships like Ulta Beauty, enhancing our same-day services, and more. We're also transforming our supply chain. This includes our journey to automate upstream replenishment with a focus on reducing store workload and increasing reliability. It also includes the build-out of our sortation center network, which offers faster delivery times while meaningfully reducing the cost of last-mile delivery. Beyond this investment in our infrastructure, we're partnering with teams across the company to enhance our inventory positioning and demand forecasting, leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance our speed, consistency, and efficiency.\nOf course, we're focused on the support, support, and development of our team, including their pay, benefits, training, and well-being. As I've said consistently during my time as CFO, our team is our most valuable asset and I'm bringing that perspective into my new role. As Christina mentioned earlier, beginning last year our team renewed their focus on retail fundamentals after several years of managing through unusually high volatility. These efforts focused first on in-stocks but encompassed a broad array of measures relating to guest experience. In total last year our store teams rolled out new training on 25 separate best practices and we've seen the benefit in our recent guest surveys. While those initial improvements are encouraging, we'll continue on that journey throughout this year to ensure we're setting the standard for the shopping experience in US retail.\nSo now let me turn to our financial results, and while our focus today is on the future, I'm also going to give a look back for perspective on our longer-term trajectory. I'll begin with a review of last year's financial performance and then compare and then examine how it compares with a decade ago. With that context, I'll look ahead to our aspirations over the next 10 years and conclude with our outlook for 2024. It's clear that last year was unusual as top-line results came in below our guidance, but our bottom line performance came in well ahead of expectations for the full year. We saw a 3.7% decline in our comparable sales, reflecting quarterly traffic trends that varied widely from the strongest performance in Q1 to the softest in Q2, and an improving trend in Q3 and Q4.\nAs traffic improved, we saw a better comp sales trend, better digital sales, and a dramatic improvement in discretionary categories. On the operating margin line, our business delivered dollar growth of nearly $2 billion last year, well beyond our initial guidance of $1 billion or more. This was driven by a rebound in our operating margin rate from historic lows in 2022, a year where we faced unusually high markdown rates, sky high freight and transportation costs, and rising rates of inventory shrink. Last year, as the team managed inventory really well, markdown rates improved dramatically and we saw a huge reduction in freight and transportation costs, more than we expected as we entered the year. Healthy inventory levels also helped our operations without the need to manage overfilled back rooms.\nStore teams were able to flow product onto their sales floor more easily and increase their focus on guest-facing work. Similarly, our supply chain facilities were able to operate more smoothly without the necessary labor hours and extra touches required to manage overly full buildings. Last year we also benefited meaningfully from the efficiency efforts we launched about a year ago. When we began this work, we said we expected to realize $2 to 3 billion in permanent efficiency gains over a three-year period, and with the first of those three years behind us, we continue to feel very good about our progress. More specifically, we estimate that these efforts delivered savings of more than half a billion dollars last year, helping to offset other profit pressures including the deleveraging effect of a soft top line, continued investments, and pay and benefits for our team, and higher inventory shrink.\nFinally, last year we continued to benefit from our Roundel ad business, which grew more than 20% in a year when we were facing challenging trends on the top line altogether. Last year's profit performance led to growth in our GAAP and adjusted EPS of nearly $3, or just under 50% compared with prior year. In addition, cash from operations more than doubled from $4 billion in 2022 to $8.6 billion last year. Finally, after-tax return on invested capital expanded by well over 3 percentage points from 12.6% in 2022 to 16.1% last year. Before I include my recap of 2023, I want to provide an update on inventory shrink, which includes the impact of retail theft. Last year, consistent with expectations, shrink costs increased more than $500 million compared with 2022, representing about 50 basis points of incremental rate pressure. Even more notable, compared with 2019, shrink costs have reduced our operating margin rate by a cumulative 1.2 percentage points over a four-year period.\nHappily, we've seen some encouraging trends recently resulting from both the actions we've taken and the community efforts we're seeing across the country. I want to pause and give a quick shout-out to our Asset Protection and Information Security teams who are working around the clock to protect the safety of our team and our guests. I'll add, however, that because it's a lagging metric, we're planning for shrink rates to remain approximately flat in 2024. So now with last year in the books, I want to briefly pull back the lens and look back over the last decade, which is a very long time in retail. This will help to highlight the journey we've been on and the capabilities we've developed, serving as the foundation for the next decade of profitable growth.\nAs you all know, the last 10 years were a time of rapid change in retail. This led to some sluggish results at Target in the early years as our business faced some significant challenges. Those periods were followed by rapid progress in later years based on the steps we took to address those challenges. Let's start with the top line. In 2013, our US business generated about $71 billion in sales, while 2023 sales were about $34.5 billion higher, representing an average growth rate of about 4% per year. Breaking down that growth by channel, about $16.5 billion occurred in our stores, while digital sales grew by another $18 billion, becoming nearly 13 times larger over that decade. Within our digital sales, same-day services, which didn't exist 10 years ago, accounted for $12.5 billion, or 70% of our digital growth between 2013 and 2023.\nOn the bottom line, our adjusted EPS in the US grew by an average of about 7.6% per year from $4.29 in 2013 to $8.94 last year, while GAAP EPS from continuing operations grew slightly faster. On top of those EPS gains, our per share dividend grew at an average rate of 10.7% per year from $1.58 in 2013 to $4.36 last year. I'd note that these bottom line returns were delivered during a decade in which our operating profitability experienced a meaningful amount of compression from a 6.7% operating margin rate in 2013 to 5.3% last year as we experienced significant pressure from inventory shrink and higher digital penetration. Going forward, we expect to offset at least a portion of this decline over time as we work to achieve an optimal and sustainable operating margin rate.\nTurning to capital deployment, our priorities have remained consistent for decades, so I'll briefly reiterate them here. We first look to reinvest capital in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our 52-year record of annual increases in the dividend per share. And finally, we deploy any excess cash after these first two uses to repurchase shares within the limits of our Middle A credit ratings. Over the last decade, our operations generated just over $67 billion of cash, and during that time, the lowest level of any single year was still more than $4 billion. These cash returns demonstrate the durability of our business as we navigated through several challenging periods over those 10 years.\nThey also give us a lot of confidence in our prospects for making continued productive investments in the years ahead. Throughout that entire decade, deployment of cash was consistent with our long-term priorities. Just over $30 billion was devoted to CapEx, accounting for about 45% of the total. Another $14.5 billion was paid as dividends, and cumulative share repurchases accounted for the remainder of just over $22 billion as we retired more than 206 million shares at an average price of about $108, all while maintaining our Middle A ratings over the entire period. So now with that long-term look back as context, I want to turn to what we expect to achieve over the next 10 years, beginning with the top line, where we're focused on three separate growth, comparable sales, new stores, and other revenue comps are expected to be the primary source of growth, with increases in the low-to-mid single-digit range in a normal year consistent with our average over the last decade.\nWe'll support this comp growth with continued investments in our business in remodels, own brands, national brands, signature partnerships, and value-added services across all channels. Turning to remodels, we plan to invest in the vast majority of our nearly 2,000-store field fleet over the next 10 years. Each year projects will range from full scale remodels in which we touch the entire store to more surgical investments including the addition of Ulta Beauty locations, fixture upgrades, support of our same-day services, and more.\nOn top of existing stores, we'll continue opening new locations based on the strong financial returns they generate. As Brian mentioned, most of these new stores will be larger on average than we've opened in recent years. Based on the opportunities we've already identified, we expect to open more than 300 additional stores over the next decade, meaningfully extending our reach into new neighborhoods. By the end of those 10 years, we expect those new stores will be generating incremental sales of around $15 billion annually. Beyond our buildings, we'll continue to focus on the well-being of our team members who enable our growth and serve as the face of Target every day. As Christina and Cara highlighted earlier, the human element as exemplified by our team is a continued differentiator for Target in a world where commerce is becoming increasingly mechanized and impersonal.\nFinally, over the next decade we expect to continue seeing outsized growth in other revenue. This has been driven in recent years by our Roundel ad business, which contributed more than $1.5 billion of value to Target last year to the benefit of both gross margin and other revenue. On top of Roundel, we also expect our digital marketplace Target Plus to make a more meaningful contribution over the next 10 years. Putting this all together over the next decade, we expect our total revenue will grow by an average rate of roughly 4% per year over the next 10 years. If we attain that goal, our business will add more than $50 billion of revenue on top of the $107 billion we delivered in 2023. That growth will enable our business to further benefit from scale efficiencies as we continue to extend our reach in the US market.\nOn the operating margin line, our ambition is to reach the optimal rate to maximize profit dollar growth over time. While we don't yet know what that rate will be, we believe it will be at least as high as our pre-pandemic rate of 6%. We made enormous progress in moving back toward 6% last year and expect to make continued progress in 2024 and beyond. Once we reach that 6% milestone, we'd be happy to continue moving higher as long as we're seeing appropriate dollar growth. For example, if we're successful in reducing shrink over the next few years, that might support our ability to sustainably operate above 6% over time.\nRegarding CapEx, we don't apply a rule of thumb to determine annual spending. Rather, we maintain a bottom-up plan and allocate capital to all the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. As you've seen in recent years, annual CapEx will vary based on the external backdrop and individual project investments, which naturally follow the evolving needs of the business. It will vary as we snap the chalk line in a specific year. For example, while in 2022 we needed to rapidly expand our upstream replenishment capacity, we're no longer feeling that same urgency today. Similarly, while we love what we're seeing in our sortation centers and expect to meaningfully grow their capacity over time, the pacing of sortation center investments has slowed somewhat in the near term given that brown box last-mile delivery volumes declined significantly last year.\nWhen we put together all of those considerations along with our long-term growth ambitions, we believe annual CapEx will typically range between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2025 and beyond. Regarding our second capital priority, we expect to continue growing the per share dividend over the next decade, and we'll manage the rate of annual increases with a goal of reaching a 40% payout ratio over time. As for our third capital priority, we expect share repurchases will continue to play a meaningful role in our EPS growth in years ahead. Our strong, strong balance sheet successfully absorbed a number of powerful shocks in 2022, and last year we made significant progress in moving our debt metrics back to appropriate levels. This sets the stage for a potential resumption in repurchase activity later this year.\nAltogether, we believe we can deliver high single digit growth in earnings per share in a typical year at or above the average you've seen over the last 10 years. And lastly, we believe our after-tax ROIC can continue to move higher into the teens over the next decade into the high teens over the next decade. So now let me turn briefly to our expectations for 2024. On the top line, we're still planning cautiously given the consumer spending patterns we've seen for two full years now. More specifically on the discretionary side of our business, even as we've seen improving trends over the last two quarters, overall demand remains soft as spending patterns continue to normalize from pandemic peaks in our frequency businesses. We're anticipating a further recovery in unit trends this year as inflation continues to moderate.\nAltogether, we're planning for a modest increase in comparable sales in the 0% to 2 range for the year. Within the year, our top line will face the highest hurdle in the first quarter, while over the remainder of the year we'll be comparing over notably softer results. As a result, while we're looking to build on the momentum we've seen in recent quarters, our plans anticipate a comp decline in the first quarter. After that, we're planning for a resumption of top line growth over the remaining three quarters of the year. On the operating margin line, we expect the impact of inventory shrink will be roughly flat to last year. In addition, given our cautious top line expectations and continued investments in long-term growth, we'll likely see some deleveraging.\nOn the SG&A line. In terms of tailwinds, we're planning for modest improvement, modest rate improvement in shipping and transportation as we annualize the benefit of the lower rate contracts negotiated throughout 2023. We're also planning for continued outsized credit growth in our Roundel ad business, contributing to both gross margin and other revenue. And of course, we expect our efficiency work will benefit both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates.\nAltogether, in 2024, we're planning for a modest increase from last year's 5.3% operating margin rate as we continue moving toward our 6% goal. On the bottom line, our 2024 expectations translate to a full year range for both GAAP and adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60. On first glance, the midpoint of this range represents growth of just under 2% versus 2023. However, I'd note that it's equivalent to a mid to high single digit increase on a 52 to 52 week basis given that last year had an extra week. Regarding the first quarter, our full year plans translate to a range of $1.70 to 2.10 for both GAAP and Adjusted EPS on an expected 3% to 5% decline in comparable sales.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital deployment, we continue to expect a CapEx range of $3 to 4 billion for the year and are planning for another strong year of cash generation. Later in the year. We'll recommend that our board approve another increase in our per share dividend. Finally, while we don't expect to repurchase any shares in Q1, we may be able to resume that activity later in the year within the limits of our Middle A ratings. As I get ready to close, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team with a particular call out to my colleagues in finance. It's been an honor to serve as your Chief Financial Officer for the last four and a half years, just as I have been. I'm confident my successor will be incredibly grateful for the leadership, integrity, passion, and discipline you bring to your work every day.\nUntil a successor is named, I'll continue to fully occupy the CFO role and partner with all of you on behalf of Target and our stakeholders. To my new team, I'm incredibly excited to be working with all of you. As I said earlier, our operations are already in great shape and I'm fortunate to be working with a strong set of leaders. I can't wait to see what we can accomplish together as we build and sustain the foundation for another decade of profitable growth at Target. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, thank you. As we get ready to take your questions, I might get started with some of the questions I can imagine are on your mind this morning. First, are the updates we shared enough to get Target back to growth? The answer is absolutely. We're confident that the roadmap we've outlined today puts our core strengths, capabilities, and points of difference to work in new ways with even greater value, relevance, ease for our current guests and US consumers more broadly. This roadmap will help us meet consumers where they are to drive traffic, profitable sales growth, and long-term market share gains. Another question might be, can Target keep building on the profit improvement you put up last year? You just heard it from Michael, nearly $2 billion in 2023 of operating income growth, far outpacing our guidance.\nMore than $0.5 billion in cost savings from ongoing efficiency efforts, giving us a fast start on our multi-year efficiency goals and realistic expectations for additional improvement in our operating margin rate this year as we move towards our 6% goal. Ultimately, I'm sure you're asking what what does this mean for shareholders over time? And that brings us back to our emphasis on long-term horizons and the durability of our business model. Again, you heard it from Michael. From 2013 to 2023, revenue grew by almost 50% while earnings per share and the annual dividend more than doubled.\nThe progress we made last year in shifting the momentum of our business, defining our roadmap for growth, and improving our profit performance has set us up to resume share repurchase potentially later this year. We know that's been an important source of shareholder returns over time, but since most of you know our capital priorities as well as we do at this point, I'm guessing you noticed that I'm ending with a priority that's been on top of the list for decades. Simply put, investing in the right strategies and capabilities for our consumers and our business is the surest way to deliver outstanding shareholder returns over decades. As you've seen in the last decade. There's a lot we can't control in the operating environment, but we are in charge of our financial decisions and the business plans and investments that drive our performance.\nWe know that if we perform well for consumers, the market will reward investors who are fueling those efforts. That's why you've seen us highlight our roadmap this morning. It reflects our team's eagerness to grow and, more importantly, our plan to execute on that ambition. It's how we're putting the assets and capabilities we built in the last decade to work in ways that are inspiring and in step with how consumers will be shopping in the next decade. It combines strengths that are unique to us into a comprehensive competitive position. A position that's difficult to replicate because no one can put it all together like Target.\nWe've said it before, it's the power of and from our stores and digital experiences to our fulfillment options, our multi-category portfolio, our signature brand partnerships, our owned brand Damas, and above all, our global team, our 400,000 Target team members, and a talented and dedicated and determined leadership team who have led and will keep leading our team through go time. But make no mistake. Everyone at Target, from the check lane to the C-suite, is committed to the next era. Grow time now. We look forward to hearing from you. I'll ask Christina, Cara, and Michael to join me back on stage so we can take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now transition into taking questions from our audience. If you have a question, please raise your hand. A member of our team will hand you a microphone to use. When you finished asking your question, please hand the microphone back to our team. This will help us get to as many people in the audience as possible. Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThe hands are going up. Why don't we start right here?\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Hi, Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. My first question is on the buying discipline. So Target makes a lot of its profit on discretionary products. Do you think you've developed new muscle over the last year or so? Or you just reacted to the environment. we'll see some of this go back?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nChristina. I think that's a great place to start. You can talk about the work we've done with our global sourcing teams to make sure we are evolving the way we buy goods across the country.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you for the question. We have evolved significantly over the last year and a half, plus what we've been living through over the last couple of years really has been quite unprecedented. And the opportunity has been to infuse more agility and flexibility into our model. So in 2023, we bought with an intention of placing bets on the things that we were most excited about. Innovation, newness, our own brands where we saw. The business trends were, but we also wanted to make sure that we created flexibility in the model. And so overall, we certainly bought less in those down trending categories to manage the inventory. But by buying less led to swifter operations, ease, and just clarity in how to operate within this environment. We were also able to introduce levers through dual sourcing capabilities, a country of production diversification, having more domestic backup.\nSo in categories like apparel, where it's really important that we're on trend and we're able to get the things that we need quickly based on what we're seeing in the market, we have increased our flexibility levers manyfold and are using reserve open-to-buy, basically receipts that we haven't spend, as well as other flexibility levers to buy into the things that are working. And it is really paying off. Not only did we manage our inventory levels significantly lower, it led to significantly increase in stocks, the best we've had in four years, as well as being able to chase into the things that mattered. Our apparel business is perhaps the best example of that, where we've seen green shoots of acceleration quarter-by-quarter and not totally visible when you look at the aggregate comp. Our discretionary comps were the best in the Q4. They were better than in the Q1. So we've seen that discretionary comp acceleration through the year. That's what we plan to build on in 2024.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI'd only add that even in 2023, as we took a more conservative approach in discretionary categories, Christina, Rick, and Jill's teams certainly leaned into key seasonal moments to make sure that we had the right newness, the right affordability as guests continue to celebrate those key seasonal moments. We'll do more of that in 2024 as we continue to make sure we adjust our flexibility to meet the needs of guests as they continue to change their shopping patterns. I'll go over on this side, Michael.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Hardlines, Broadlines, and Food Retail, UBS\n\nThank you. I have two questions. One, it seems like if we were to characterize the strategy today, it would be remodel the stores, introduce new products, leverage some of the relationships that you have with your customers through a reintroduced Circle program. You have a lot of experience with those strategies. Is it right for us to think that even each one of those could contribute 100 basis points to your comp. That's how you build to getting a low-to-mid single-digit comp over the long term? Then a more near-term question. You're guiding to 3% to 5% comps decline for Q1, flat to up 2%.\nHow do you go from point A to point B? And how have you factored in some of the uncertainties, like, you know, changes in credit card fees and the overall? Uncertain environment given that this election year. In the year ahead. Thank you very much.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation",
    "content3": "I'm happy to start. Michael, we're not going to provide you the waterfall today that breaks all those components apart. But everything you've talked about is baked into our plans. We certainly expect new stores to be a major contributor as we go forward. Michael talked about over a decade. We expect those 300 new stores to generate about $15 billion of incremental revenue. We'll continue to invest in remodels, and we've got a long track record of seeing those remodels deliver really good returns. We'll continue to lean into our own brands, our national brands, and those great brand partnerships to make sure we're providing our guests with the newness and inspiration they're looking for.\nWe're very excited, as you heard from Cara, about the new Target Circle program, the benefits of that base program, Circle Card, and the excitement around Target Circle 360 and how that will extend our same-day offering to guests, bring it right to their home within an hour. So each one of those elements plays a key role. We're very excited about the enhancements we've made from an overall digital standpoint to provide more ease, inspiration, and discovery for our guests. And we both Michael and Cara talked about the upward potential we see in Roundel. So they'll all play a key role as we go forward.\nBut I think it fundamentally starts with us understanding consumer trends, how consumers are shopping today and will shop differently going forward and continue to meet their needs no matter how they want to shop with Target, either in a physical store, in a digital environment, whether it starts with social or they're just walking into a great neighborhood Target store, store. So each element is going to contribute to our roadmap for growth. Underneath all of that is that continued focus on retail fundamentals, the blocking and tackling that make sure we provide our guests a great physical and digital experience, making sure we're always in stock, that we leverage our proximity, that we provide great affordability, and we're there to provide a great guest experience, no matter how you shop with our brand.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. And maybe just, you know, add on that by kind of reinforcing a point Brian made. I love the fact you can't decompose our strategy into discrete things. It's how they work together. A guest engaging with Circle that finds, you know, discretionary category discovery within that experience. And so it's never one plus one equals two. We're hoping, you know, one plus one plus one equals ten. And it's how all of it comes together. You asked a question specifically on the cadence as we move through the year. I touched on it a little bit in my remarks. We anniversary some of the strongest business last year in Q1, and so we would expect to see a build as we move through 2024.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nHow about right back here.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nScott Ciccarelli with Truist. Can you guys provide any more color? On your most recent shrink results? And can you help us understand what happens with the sales velocity of products when you put them behind lock and key?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, Michael, I'm happy to start because I know it's a topic on everyone's mind. And when I think about shortage, when I think about shrink, I'll start with the word progress. I think we're seeing really solid progress and greater awareness at the national, state, and local level. Certainly our teams have been working to ensure we provide a great guest experience and provide an experience that's safer for our team and safer for our guests. Michael, I think our teams have made significant progress, but a lot more to come.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean, I can't say enough about the hard work of the teams that have led to that ton of progress that Brian hit on. And the way that rolls into our guidance is we're expecting shrink to be flat year-over-year. We'll learn a lot in the first quarter. We inventory a lot of stores in Q1, and so we'll be smarter a quarter from now. But that progress has us expecting, for a lagging metric, flat. And we'll see what we learn as we go through the year.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAll right, just roll it back here.\n\nMike Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nThank you. Hi, Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson. I wanted to talk about your efficiency efforts in the $500 million that you achieved this year. How do we think about that over the next few years? Is that linear? Does it sort of get sort of rolled downhill and get better? What is assumed in your 2024 outlook? Thanks.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, well, I'm happy to start. The teams work against a tough top line to deliver that efficiency progress this year. It's a great start. I can view that as a down payment toward that $2 to 3 billion that we expect to get over time. The, you know, the things a little closer in that were highlights of that this year. I'd call out the continued benefits of something like our sortation centers. You know, we have a sortation center in a market; we're faster and we're cheaper than other forms of delivery. I also, and we touched on a little bit in the conversation already, but it warrants another shout out. The benefit of exceptionally well managed inventory just shows up everywhere.\nWe're so much more productive in store and in our DCs when inventory is well managed, and so feel really good about the team's work there in 2023. Feel great about our inventory position as we step into 2024. I would expect our teams to continue taking the growth we've seen and the growth we expect and to translate that more into more efficiencies over time.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, Michael, I'd only add that, taking a very measured approach to setting priorities year-by-year, we see opportunities in stores, in supply chain, opportunities to better leverage technology to continue to build on that efficiency roadmap. So year after year, we'll reset priorities to make sure we're laser focused on delivering those results, and they'll build over time.All right, how about back over here?\n\nDanny Bretthauer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, HSBC\n\nHi. Congratulations on the presentation. Danny Bretthauer with HSBC. Question to Cara on the new Target Circle program. I mean, is $49 obviously like an introductory price? How long are you willing to sustain at that price level? Because I think it's hard to make the math with same-day, one-hour delivery at $49. How do you plan to compete with the other programs, loyalty programs out there? What would be some of the key differentiators other than this entry $49 price point? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nCara, I'll let you take it away.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nTake it away. We're really excited to talk about it. I think it's really important that we really anchor on the entire Target Circle ecosystem. That was really important to us. The notion of accessibility and for all is really, really important. That's why we first are reimagining how we're thinking about delivering value. Our guests are really clear. They want value, affordability, and they want ease. We're making it even easier for our 100 million members to actually be able to get the deals and rewards that they want with automatic savings applied at checkout. I'll hit on your question around pricing in just a minute, but I think it's really important to talk about our cardholders as well today. The cardholders. That program doesn't work with Target Circle.\nWhat we're doing is we're actually bringing these two things together so that not only do you get 5% off every trip and extended returns and free shipping, you also get all the benefits of the base Target Circle program, which are those deals that our guests love and those personalized rewards that are based specifically on your shopping behavior. The other thing that we're adding for our cardholders is an evergreen price of $49 for Target Circle360. So if you are a cardholder for us, always on price will be $49, which is an amazing price and it's less than a dollar a week of the magic of Target delivered to your door. For Target Circle360, we're really excited to build on our strength in same-day delivery since our acquisition of Shipt in 2017.\nYou will get the magic of Target delivered to your door in less than an hour. You'll also have access to the Shipt marketplace of benefits. You will also have access to all of those deals, rewards, and personalized perks as part of the base Target Circle program. It's just the beginning for us. That $49 is an introductory promotional price for Target Circle 360.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI just want to take this moment, and I hope many of our leaders back home are listening, and just thank the Circle team. The teams have been working on this program for months and months. Our tech teams have been supporting them, and the entire effort the organization has put behind bringing this forward today. As you can tell, we are really excited about the future of Target Circle and think it's going to be a major growth driver, deepen guest relevance, and bring new consumers into the Target franchise. All right, back up front.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, it's Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. I had two questions. One was Michael, could you jus—you said Roundel will be up again. I think it was 20% last year for guidance this year. Are you thinking that offsets any pressure on credit and just, you know, tell us how credit's going. And then my other question goes back to traffic. Great to hear all the initiatives in the Target Circle in the guidance. What are we thinking about with AUR and Average Ticket given that it is a value focused consumer. We heard all the products that are under $10 and all this. So in that 0 to 2 comp, how much would traffic be up 3 while AUR is down, something like that?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nSo if I start with the questions on the credit side of things, we've seen, I think we've characterized it throughout the year, kind of an expected return to normal in a lot of those underlying credit metrics. And so you've seen a little bit of softness year over year there that in 2023, you know, was offset nicely and then some by the incredible growth we've seen in the Roundel business. And as a reminder, I think I said this twice in remarks. Roundel is both a little other revenue and a lot of gross margin. And so it benefits two places to get to that, you know, $1.5 billion of value in total. But we've seen outsized growth there and we would expect that to continue this year.\nWe're really confident about our prospects to continue growing our Roundel business to the benefit of the guests that get, you know, strong engagement with all of those offers, another example of how the strategy fits together. The more engagement we have with Circle, the better we know our guests, the better we know our guests, the better we can serve them through Roundel. And so we're excited about what growth looks like there. Your second question, Greg, refresh my memory.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nTraffic.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, we won't break out ticket versus traffic, but the theme I'll talk about that we've seen this year is, you know, a moderation of inflation. I think what disinflation is, the word of the quarter in retail. That's a good thing for the consumers. You've heard, for the consumer, you've heard us talk about, you know, that being one of the inputs to some share of wallet recovery on the discretionary side of things. And so we're pleased to see that ticket pressure because we think it's a good thing for the US consumer.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAll right.\n\nEd Yruma\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nHi. Thanks. Ed Yruma, Piper Sandler. You spent much of the last decade kind of opening 8 typical stores, small boxes, urban locations, and it sounds like you're pivoting back to kind of traditional large boxes and ostensibly suburban areas. Would love to understand kind of what that small box portfolio looks like. Like, have you been pleased with the returns given some of the changes in the urban dynamic? And then as you look to these larger stores, how should we think about the role of food in some of these bigger boxes? Thanks.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThat is a great question. I'm happy to start. Actually, over the last couple of years, you've seen us move from a focus on small stores, and we can talk about the performance there, to more larger sized stores as we see new opportunities and catchments where we haven't competed in the past. We've been very pleased with the performance of these new full size stores, as well as the continued performance in urban centers and on college campuses. So as we look at our pipeline going forward, we recognize there's opportunities for more full size stores, extend our proximity, bring the best of Target into some new trading areas, and, as part of that, you will see us continue to expand our Food and Beverage offering.\nRick talked about the progress we've seen in Food and Beverage adding over $8 billion in the last couple of years and the strength of a brand like Good & Gather. For many of you who are tracking the consumer packaged goods industry, there aren't a lot of $4 billion brands out there. We launched that brand just prior to the pandemic. We just continue to see the steady growth and how our guests react to the quality and value we bring with Good & Gather. We're excited about the pipeline. It will be more larger sized stores, there will be a broader food offering, and we're going to be moving into trade areas where we can pick up incremental volume and market share because we in many cases just haven't competed in these trade areas in the past. Michael, you want to talk about some of the returns we're seeing with some of our smaller stores?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, we feel really good about the returns of the small stores, and it's great to have that flexibility in kind of our toolbox of what's the right thing to build for the opportunity in a specific market. To be clear, going forward, if the right opportunity can be fit with a 25,000sq ft box that brings us closer to a college campus or an urban center, we know how to do that. We like the returns, and we'll lean in there. But as we step back and look at what that pipeline looks like in total, it's actually the big box stores where we're able to bring the best of Target that are bubbling to the top in terms of where we expect returns to be strongest. And so, you know, we'll lean in to that shift over time.\nYou know, if our properties team was here on the stage with us, they could roll out a map of the US and show a bunch of Manhattan locations where we'd love to bring Target to new communities. We feel good about what that pipeline looks like.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAnd I'd add three more points as we think about small formats and we're here in Manhattan. 10 years ago we really didn't have a brand presence in Manhattan. Today we have over a dozen locations and we're in many of the different neighborhoods across the city. We've now been connecting with a consumer that we couldn't reach in the past and we're gonna build a long term relationship there. We're on many college campuses across the country. We know the value of building a connection with college students while they're on campus and the lifelong benefits that's gonna provide for our brand as they move into their first apartment or have their first child and start their families.\nOne of the other things I'll let Christina build on it is the work we've done with smaller formats has allowed us to understand a lot more about segmentation and getting the assortment right, geography by geography. As we move into new markets, we're going to get much better at segmentation, having the right assortment that reflects the demand in those local markets. There have been three really important benefits of our small format journey. We're touching new cities where we didn't have a presence in the past, we'll build a lifelong connection with college students, and we've learned a lot more about segmenting our assortment.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, the only thing I'd add, even lifelong relationship with college students. You heard Jill; be very intentional. We actually seek to make sure that we are really relevant at certain life stages, especially, especially, early on in our consumers' lives. Think about the strength that we have in a business like baby. Then we migrate them to toys. Then we migrate them into video games and/or into juniors. And then having that presence. We do very well at back-to-school and back-to-college timeframes. Very intentional. Making sure that our brand stays in touch with families through every life stage. College is the natural next step in that phase. And then of course back to childbirth. So afterwards. And so that's been very intentional. But then to build back on segmentation opportunities. Yeah, we've learned a lot.\nI mean these boxes are small; they're difficult to operate. We certainly have to cut the SKU count intensively, and we have to study the macro or the microenvironment competitors. And so this ability to formulate the right assortment strategy for that community has taught us a lot about the potential to expand that further into our larger size boxes. And we see tons of upside and potential in more sophisticated segmentation and allocation strategies that allow us to optimize the local potential.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nCara, one of the things you and I have talked a lot, a lot, is as we open up new stores, there's certainly a physical store component. We drive a lot of new revenue. But there's also benefits from a digital standpoint as we introduce the brand to new communities. You want to expand on some of the things we've learned.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. We see—we talk a lot about digitally influence sales. We know how consumers are shopping today. And so many of us, right, are starting even if you love shopping and only purchase in stores, you're using our app to check out what's new, to see if something is in stock, et cetera. So we understand the power of digitally influenced store sales. What we also see, though, is the power of store-influenced digital sales because we know some guests are browsing in stores and actually are pulling up their app right while they're in the store and having impact digitally. We certainly also see, as we enter new markets, the power of our same-day sales services that has been a shining star for us across the entire digital portfolio.\nI talked in my remarks about why that is in terms of the relationship that we have. And once guests try our same-day services, they love it. It is sticky in their lives. We are literally making their lives better. So we'll continue to build on that. But that's another great example.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAll right, we've got time for a couple more questions. Let's go up here.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHi, it's Bob Drbul, Guggenheim Securities. I just wondered if we could spend a few minutes on gross margin, maybe Q4 buckets and the performance detail around that, your assumptions in 2024 for the full year. And then curious if you could share the financial implications, especially around gross margin on Target Circle 360 your assumptions for the rollout for this year?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, Michael, this is a surprise. We've made it all the way to the last few minutes of our conference today and this is the first time we've had a question about gross margin.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nExcited to get the question as always. Well, I can start by unpacking a little bit what we saw in Q4, and there's some consistent themes to what we saw in the broader part of the year. Because the theme of gross margin recovery this year, and I think Q4 and the year we were just shy of 3 percentage points of improvement in gross margin, better inventory management. We saved a lot of markdowns and costs that were associated with some of the inventory challenges that we had a couple of years ago. So on a year-over-year basis, that's a big source of improvement within there too. Freight and transportation is in a much better place today from a cost perspective. Not all the way back to 2019 levels, but on a year over year basis another significant source of improvement.\nIn addition, we also see benefit from digital and supply chain, I mean to the tune of, I think, 50 basis points in the right direction for the quarter and the year. That's a combination of being more productive as inventory levels have been better managed, and a little bit of tailwind from fewer brown boxes shipped. With our brown box business being down on a year-over-year basis, as we look ahead to next year, you know, all of our best assumptions are wrapped into the EPS guidance we've given, and you know, a little bit of detail deleveraging, given a cautious view on the top-line with some continued improvement in gross margin, we think is going to be the right recipe going forward. When it comes to Target Circle instead of speaking to any, you know, specific assumption within, you know, that business case, I'd think of Target Circle as about growth.\nWhen we meet our guests with the right value proposition in a free loyalty program and the right value proposition in Target Circle 360 delivered to your doorstep through Target 360 and if you're looking for 5% more every day, we've got a Target Circle Card for you. All of that's about stronger relevancy and growth. And so, the line of the P&L I'm most excited about from a Target Circle standpoint is growth.\nTime and time again, if we think about the P&L through the lens of the guest, we get to the right decisions. You know, it costs us a little bit more to serve a Drive Up order than it does an in-store trip. When guests start using Drive Up, we've described it before; it continues to be true. They spend 20% to 30 more at Target thereafter. We're making decisions with what we think drives the most value and growth in total.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOkay. Go back here.\n\nIvan Feinseth\n\nChief Investment Officer, Tigress Financial Partners\n\nIvan Feinseth, Tigress Financial Partners. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the great results out this morning.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nIvan Feinseth\n\nChief Investment Officer, Tigress Financial Partners\n\nI have three questions. First, Cara, in thinking about like store layout and remodel, like for example in my local Target, you know food is on like the left side but yet cookware is all the way on the other side of the store. Sometimes, you know, when I'm purchasing food I find a need, I may need some cookware to do the dish I'm looking to cook. As an example.\nSecond is information that you get from using Shipt where a Shipt customer will go outside to other retailers? How much do you take on that information to decide what you're gonna carry in the stores? Then if they're using, let's say, buying premium brand, how high of a premium price point do you see yourself going? Because there are some of your competitors. That are using value-priced food to bring in customers, but those customers are buying premium priced products. And then, third, on the partnership, what other areas do you see? And how far of a premium level would you go in adding partnerships within your store?\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThere's a lot there.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nCara, why don't you start with partnerships? And Christina, why don't you talk about some of the learning that we have around how we build assortments?\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nEVP and Chief Guest Experience Officer, Target Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. And so as I think about the introduction of Target Circle 360, we are absolutely looking at a wide range of what partnerships could look like to add benefits. Importantly though, we are always going to be listening to our guests. That is how we actually struck up our conversation and partnership with Ulta Beauty as well as what we offer in our base program today with Apple. And so we'll be guest led, not Target led. As we think about the types of partnerships that will add value to our guest lives, I do want to hit on specifically your question around Shipt. We do not leverage any data of Shipt on their marketplace internally Target as we think about our assortment.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nMore specifically on how we build assortment and premium prices. To answer some of your questions, our goal is to make sure that we are meeting our guests' needs across a wide range of shopping occasions. And so we look at—you heard us describe this especially when we talk about omnichannel, right? We look for unmet need space and white spaces to innovate against. Over the last year we spent a lot of time making sure that we have our value equation shored up. And the introduction of Dealworthy is a big deal for us. It is an opening price point brand across the entirety of the portfolio outside of Food and Beverage where we already have Market Pantry. So just make sure we really have value options for all consumers so that they can meet their budgets.\nOn the flip side, we do really well with Ulta Beauty, which is premium beauty. It's based on the insight that we've known for years in beauty. Almost all beauty shoppers shop both. They shop mass and they shop premium. For us to be able to service the guests and service all the trips in that category, we needed a solution for both which allowed us to build this partnership with Ulta, which we're really, really happy about. We do that across the portfolio to say, where's the opportunity for Target to serve a unique need and where are their unmet needs in the category? Our guest has given us a lot of freedom to say, you know, I'll spend $600 on this item and by the way, I don't want to spend more than $2 on my body wash.That's fine, whatever works for them.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI just finished up that discussion by saying, I think we've learned time and time again, we make really good decisions when we listen to the guests and listen to the broader consumer trends. Some of the things we rolled out recently, Starbucks for our Drive Up guests, we didn't come up with that. It was the guest saying, \"Well, if Target could only provide me with my favorite Starbucks product, I'd enjoy this Drive Up experience even more.\" If you could take my returns, I would really be pleased. So we respond to what the guest and the consumer tells us and that's gonna guide us for years to come. All right, we've got time for one final question. So. So I guess we're going right over here.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks, Chris Horvers J.P. Morgan, nice to see you. Thank you for the presentation. So i have two questions. The first question is, you think about the performance in Q4. How do you think about share? Do you think it's more give back from the COVID pump? Do you think it's the consumer's just so focused on food and value and you're just not getting the trip so it's not resonating to the power of the Target box? And how do you think about recapturing that share going forward? And then my second question is for Michael, as you look at like just the seasonality or business seem to imply—you're implying a step down in operating margin in Q1 relative to Q4 was. So was there anything unique either in Q4 or Q1 that, you know, making that the case? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, why don't you start with the second half and I'll wrap up with Chris's first question.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. So as we look at the first quarter, I think the key thing there is our cautious approach on the top line, and there's some differences year-over-year and what we anniversary. But that's a source of pressure in the first quarter. And as we get back to growth deeper in the year, we'll see some of that pressure subside. So that's the headline on that one, Chris.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAnd Chris, from a market share standpoint, I can assure everyone here we look at market share in a very granular way every single week across our entire portfolio, and we're going to be very focused on taking market share as we go forward. I'll step back, not just look at the last year, but the last several years. If I go all the way back to the pre-pandemic, we've added billions and billions of dollars of revenue growth. I think, Michael, over $30 billion. We've deepened our relationship with guests along the way, we've added more capabilities and features, we've deepened partnerships, and those are going to guide us to be even a more relevant retailer and partner for consumers and guests for years to come.\nSo we are very focused right now over not just the next year but the next 10 years to continue to drive even more traffic to our stores and website to make sure we are a company that's driving top line growth because we know that's the best way to reward our shareholders. We are absolutely going to be razor focused on taking market share as we go forward. Sitting here today, we know there's significant opportunities across virtually every aspect of our portfolio. Whether it's the work that Jill's leading in apparel and home or the work Rick's doing from a Food and Beverage standpoint, and a beauty and essential standpoint. Whether it's physical stores or digital, we see a pathway for continued market share growth.\nWe'll look at that every single week and talk about it every quarter because we know that's critically important to our roadmap for growth. I appreciate everyone who joined us in person today. Those of you who have joined us through the video and the conference, thanks so much. We look forward to seeing you and hearing from you during our first quarter earnings report. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining us."

We're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. Finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K.\nAlso, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the Q3 and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. For many years now, we have focused on building a durable business model that allows us to meet guests where they are, developing and enhancing the right tools and capabilities while investing heavily in our team, all in the service of providing an affordable, easy, and joyful guest experience. The flexibility of our multi-category model has served us incredibly well over the last few years, delivering unprecedented growth in both traffic and sales.\nToday, our business generates well over $100 billion in annual revenue, and it's successfully navigating through a very challenging environment as consumers continue to rebalance their spending between goods and experiences and make tough choices in the face of persistent inflation.\nEven as our P&L is being impacted by multiple top-line and bottom-line challenges, including soft industry trends in discretionary categories, moderating inflation rates in essentials and food and beverage, and higher inventory shrink, we've seen a meaningful improvement in profitability compared with last year. More specifically, our EPS through the first three quarters of 2023 was more than 40% higher than last year and more than 26% higher than in 2019.\nImportantly, even beyond this year's rapid progress, we believe we have a significant opportunity to grow both the top line and bottom line in the years ahead. So even as we remain cautious in our near-term outlook, we're not standing still. We're playing the long game, investing in our stores, our supply chain, our team, our digital capabilities, and our assortment to provide the newness, value, and convenience our guests want for this holiday season and beyond.\nAt the heart of it all is our focus on being our guests' happy place and delivering the joyful shopping experience that makes Target Target. In the Q3, Target's comparable sales were down 4.9%, in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarters and overall industry trends, discretionary categories were the driver of this decline, partially offset by net sales growth in our frequency categories. Between sales channels, store comp trends were somewhat stronger than in the digital channel.\nAmong our digital fulfillment capabilities, same-day services saw high single-digit comp growth, led by Drive Up, which expanded 12%. Strength in these services was offset by continued softness in brown box delivery, which is most affected by the pullback in discretionary categories. On the bottom line, our Q3 EPS of $2.10 was well above our expectations and more than 36% ahead of last year.\nThis increase reflected the continued benefit of lower freight costs, disciplined inventory management by our team, favorable category and channel mix, and the continued benefit of our work to enhance efficiency, which offset multiple pressures throughout our business. This is outstanding profit performance in the face of a very challenging environment, and I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts in support of our guests, our business, and each other.\nAs you know, one of our top priorities this year was to rebuild our profitability following the unique challenges we faced in 2022. And while there's lots more work ahead of us, I'm really pleased with the progress our team has delivered so far this year. At the same time, I want to make it clear we are not satisfied with the top-line trends we've been seeing.\nOur number one priority is to get back to sustainable growth in both traffic and sales, and we're committed to investing in long-term initiatives to deliver this growth. As we assess the external environment, it's clear that consumers have been remarkably resilient. Yet at the same time, our research indicates that themes like uncertainty, caution, managing my time and budget, and focusing on essentials while still finding ways to celebrate are all top of mind.\nOverall, consumers are still spending, but pressures like higher interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayments, increased credit card debt, and reduced savings rates have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade-offs in their family budgets. For example, this year, we've seen more and more consumers delaying their spending until the last moment.\nGuests who previously bought sweatshirts or denim in August or September are deciding to wait until the weather turns cold before making a purchase. This is a clear indication of the pressures they're facing as they work to stretch their budgets until the next paycheck. Consistent with these pressures, as we look at recent trends across the retail industry, dollar sales are being driven by higher prices, with consumers buying fewer units per trip.\nIn fact, overall unit demand across the industry has been down 2% to 4% in recent quarters, and the industry has experienced seven consecutive quarters of declines in discretionary dollars and units. While we're happy to see inflation rates moderating this year, if you compare industry pricing in key categories back to 2020, food at home pricing for families has increased 25% overall, and in some areas, up to 30%.\nIf you're a parent raising a baby, you're facing increases of more than 30% on baby food and formula too. That's in addition to persistent increases in a variety of other categories. When you layer on the impact of higher energy prices, it all puts pressure on discretionary spending. As a result, this holiday season, we're focusing on highlighting the amazing value we've always provided in our end caps, promotions, and the price points we feature in our marketing.\nAs we built our plans for this holiday season, we maintained our cautious inventory positioning in markdown-sensitive categories. This provides our team the necessary flexibility to quickly adjust to volatile trends, something that has served us well all year. But I want to be crystal clear: that does not mean we're backing off on newness.\nWhile we're cautious about the size of our inventory commitments, we're leaning into the amount of innovation featured in our assortment. After several years in which our vendors were focused on raising production volumes in the face of unprecedented demand, we're encouraged by the focus on newness and innovation we're seeing from them. As I've mentioned, throughout this holiday season, we'll be focused on highlighting value, helping families to celebrate the joy of the season in a way that fits their budget.\nBeyond our assortment, as we work to provide a great guest experience, we've enhanced our training of retail fundamentals for our teams. This is an important shift after years of operating in an environment that was anything but normal. After all, given the large number of team members we've hired over the last few years, a meaningful number of them have never experienced ordinary sales trends.\nAs we've said many times, investments in our team are the most important ones we make, and today we remain on our front foot, investing to ensure they can deliver a joyful, industry-leading shopping experience. This holiday season, we'll be supplementing our existing team by hiring nearly 100,000 seasonal team members to meet expected demand and ensure we can deliver a joyful shopping experience.\nSo now, as I get ready to hand the call over to Christina, I think it would be useful to pause and assess how this year has progressed in comparison to our expectations. As a reminder, at the beginning of this year, we said we were expecting a challenging environment with a sales guidance range centered around flat comparable sales.\nIn terms of profitability, we said we expected to grow our full-year operating income by $1 billion or more, with an expected EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75. So today, with 3/4 of the year behind us, top-line trends have obviously been tougher than expected, and we're firmly focused on getting back to growth. But the story on profitability has been very different.\nThrough the first 3/4 of this year, we've already grown operating income by more than $1 billion compared with last year, despite unexpected headwinds from higher-than-expected shrink and softer-than-expected sales. We're encouraged with this performance against a challenging backdrop, which demonstrates the resilience of both our team and our business. I'm incredibly proud to be a member of this great team and excited about the growth we're positioned to deliver in the years ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Christina.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we've shared for the past several quarters now, even as our guests face tough choices as they manage their budgets, they're also continuing to celebrate seasonal moments while showing their excitement for new product offerings and compelling value. After all, consumers are feeling the weight of multiple economic pressures, and discretionary retail has borne the brunt of this weight for many quarters now.\nIn addition, consumers are facing newly emerging headwinds, including higher interest rates and the return of student loan payments. In the face of this mental and emotional tug-of-war, consumers are looking for a respite, which is why we are relentless in our pursuit to provide ease, inspiration, joy, and comprehensive value every day.\nAnd while we are not satisfied with our current performance, I'm confident that our team's empathy and their continued focus on serving our guests' wants and needs will pay dividends in the years ahead. As Brian mentioned, our Q3 comparable sales decline reflected continued softness in discretionary categories, partially offset by growth and beauty. Notably, comps within frequency categories slowed between Q2 and Q3, driven entirely by a deceleration in the comp benefit from growth in average retails.\nMore specifically, in both food and beverage, and beauty and essentials, the benefit from average pricing decelerated by about three percentage points between the Q2 and Q3s as we move beyond the period of peak inflation from a year ago. As we've said, a lower inflation rate is welcome news as it will reduce pressure on consumer budgets, making room for them to expand back into discretionary categories over time.\nBeauty-led performance in the quarter with comparable sales growth in the high single digits, driven by strength across core beauty and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings. We're excited to launch Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in Q3, and it has quickly become one of our top-selling beauty brands across the chain. In food and beverage, comp sales were down slightly to last year. Seasonal candy, snacks, and hosting solutions performed particularly well.\nComp sales in essentials declined in the low single digits despite strength in healthcare and baby categories. Comp sales in our discretionary categories remained soft in Q3, with declines ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. However, trends improved markedly compared with Q2, thanks to the agility of our team and their focus on listening and responding to our guests.\nHome saw a high single-digit comp decline and improvement of more than six percentage points from the Q2. Most notably, we saw strength in back-to-school and college categories and a great response to our assortment of Stanley drinkware. Additionally, within kitchenware, we launched our most recent owned brand, Figmint, and received an enthusiastic response from our guests. Figmint offers more than 250 items ranging from enameled cookware to ceramic mixing bowls to kitchen gadgets, all at a quality, aesthetic, and value that can't be topped.\nApparel comparable sales also declined high single digits and an improvement of nearly three percentage points when compared with Q2. The business was strongest within new offerings, including our partnership with Kendra Scott Jewelry, the latest All in Motion performance wear, and new fall fashion sets within our women's categories. Hardline's comparable sales were down in the low teens.\nWhile we were encouraged by back-to-school performance, demand for electronics remains particularly soft. This quarter's performance demonstrates that while our results are not immune to macro conditions, when we focus on retail fundamentals, offer exciting new products at incredible value, and respond to our guests' wants and needs in a timely manner, we remain relevant with our guests even against a challenging backdrop.\nBy leaning into seasonal moments like back-to-school, back-to-college, and Halloween, we not only drove sales in the current quarter. We helped to build lasting affinity with our guests. This focus on celebrating the season creates an engaging experience that keeps Target top of mind.\nAnd that's why we continue to offer events like our latest Target Circle Week in early October, which added another 500,000 members to our loyalty platform, providing future opportunities to engage with these guests in deeper ways.\nOur goal this holiday season is to create the perfect combination of incredible value, inspiring and fresh products, and a joyful shopping experience as you stroll the aisles in our stores or on the recently refreshed Target website and app.\nWe aim to deepen the relationships with our guests as they look to deck the halls and celebrate the joys that the holidays bring. As we do year-round, we are leaning into The Power of And this holiday season by not focusing only on one aspect of our strategy but celebrating how they all work together to create a unique offering in a crowded retail landscape.\nOur plans start with a celebratory experience that you feel the moment you walk into our stores or open the Target website or app, featuring on-trend and inspiring color palettes, imagery, and in-store marketing that complements all the excitement and joy we are creating with our national marketing campaigns. Guests will feel the holiday spirit before they even add their first item to the cart. The excitement builds with our assortment at unbeatable value, only at Target-exclusive merchandise, and our easy and convenient holiday solutions.\nThrough it all, we'll remain diligent on executing the necessary retail fundamentals our guests want and expect from us, including being in stock on the must-have items of the season, offering unmatched value and pricing, highlighting our inspiring and differentiated merchandise assortment, and making each trip easy and convenient regardless of where, when, and how a guest chooses to shop.\nWhether a guest knows exactly what they're looking for or needs a bit of inspiration, we want to make the trip joyful, easy, and welcoming. And we know families want to celebrate the holidays, but they're relying on us to help them do so affordably. With a combination of everyday low prices, compelling promotions, and exciting savings events all season long, we aim to be the holiday destination for affordable joy.\nSo with Thanksgiving right around the corner, guests shopping for a food and beverage area will discover how we're helping families celebrate with a Thanksgiving meal that includes all the family favorites for under $25, featuring $0.99 per pound Good & Gather turkeys and the must-have sides for just $5. As they explore our assortment, guests will discover exciting gifting options for every loved one.\nIn toys, guests will find the characters and items their kids want at prices designed to fit every budget, with over 2/3 of this season's toy assortment priced under $25. In addition, around one in four toy items is a Target exclusive featuring everyone's favorite properties, including Barbie, Paw Patrol, Pokémon, Marvel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, LEGO, and so much more.\nAnd so far, among the most popular toys in our assortment are all things Target, including Plush Bullseye Dogs, Barbie First Job at Target dolls, and Target cash register and shopping cart toys, a nod to the Target brand love even among our youngest guests. And back by popular demand, we have an exciting array of toys from FAO Schwarz, including only at Target exclusives with 50% of the assortment under $20.\nWith so many options to choose from, we are making it easier than ever to help narrow in on what will bring the biggest smiles this holiday season through exciting in-store displays and experiences. On Target.com, as well as the Target app, guests can immerse themselves in a digital 360-degree room filled with the hottest toys for kids of all ages to try before they buy. When the presents are taken care of, it will be time to deck the halls, and we're offering an array of holiday decor at even lower prices than ever before.\nNearly 2/3 of the assortment will be priced under $20, with in-store and digital signing and displays making it easy for guests to see how they can refresh their holiday decor affordably with $15 ornament sets, family baking solutions, and Mondo Llama craft sets, $10 throw pillows and tree skirts, and so much more.\nOf course, the season is all about gathering with loved ones. Guests will find all the best entertaining, gifting, and gathering solutions in this year's assortment, and we're launching more than 100 new items in Good & Gather and Favorite Day, with over half of these priced under $5.\nThroughout the holiday season, guests can rest assured that they'll get the best price and quality whenever and however they shop. We'll be offering incredible deals leading up to Black Friday, including four weeks of deals on tens of thousands of items, with many up to 50% off.\nTarget Circle members will receive exclusive promotions and offers to reward and deepen their love of all things Target. Plus, we've added more personalization than ever before, giving them even more options to earn rewards. And of course, we'll offer our season-long price match guarantee, which assures guests that no matter when they shop, they'll get the best price of the season.\nThe holidays are so special to so many families, and they are made even brighter by everything our team members do for our guests and for each other. I'm so inspired by how each of our teams, from marketing to merchandising to stores to supply chain, are bringing their best to create something truly magical and uniquely Target this holiday season.\nI want to thank the entire Target team around the world for being the not-so-secret weapon that will help us to win the holiday season.\nAs I get ready to end my remarks, John, I want to pause and thank you and acknowledge your countless contributions to the Target brand and team. I've greatly appreciated getting to work alongside you for so many years, and know your legacy will be felt for many more. With that, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nJohn Mulligan\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina. Over the last 3.5 years, our operations have continually faced unusual and rapidly changing external conditions. In 2020 and 2021, after the onset of the pandemic, we couldn't secure enough inventory to satisfy the explosion in demand for our products, and we saw operating margin rates grow well beyond normal levels.\nThen, in early 2022, the period of rapid growth in discretionary categories suddenly reversed, and we quickly moved from having too little inventory to having way too much. As a result, both our distribution centers and store backrooms filled up well beyond optimal levels, and operating margin rates quickly moved to historical lows.\nThis year, as Brian mentioned, a key priority was to optimize our inventory position so it was better aligned to the current size and growth rate of our business.\nWe were confident that if we were successful in that effort, our operations would become more efficient, markdowns would come back down, and we'd see our profit rate recover back toward more sustainable long-term levels. Through the first three quarters of the year, despite unexpectedly soft top-line trends, the team has delivered a more rapid recovery in our profitability than we'd even planned at the beginning of the year. L\nooking ahead, we've maintained this cautious inventory posture in planning for the Q4 as well. More specifically, at the end of the Q3, total inventory on our balance sheet was 14% lower than a year ago, with discretionary category inventory down 19%.\nImportantly, while this ending inventory position was 29% higher than at the end of Q3 2019, that's aligned with growth we've seen on the sales line over those four years, making us feel really good about both the size and the health of our inventory position as we enter the holiday season.\nIn addition, even though we own a lot less inventory than a year ago, the team has delivered meaningfully improved reliability and in-stock metrics this year, and they made additional progress in Q3. More specifically, overall in-stocks in the Q3 improved nearly a percentage point compared with Q2, and more than three percentage point from a year ago. Notably, in-stocks in our highest volume store saw an even greater year-over-year improvement.\nIn terms of our top-selling items, while the in-stock rate remained consistent between Q2 and Q3, that was after we grew the size of that list by about 75%, meaning that today, our top item list accounts for more than 1/3 of our total sales. Beyond these broader metrics, we also saw meaningful improvements in our seasonal in-stocks and a more than six percentage point improvement in new item in-stocks.\nIn our smaller stores, which on average have less shelf capacity and turn faster than the chain, in-stocks have improved by more than two percentage points between the Q1 and Q3s. Today, our in-stock levels in those stores are slightly better than the overall chain.\nAnd finally, in the digital channel, the percent of items available for purchase has improved by more than two points compared with last year, reflecting an improvement of nearly eight percentage points in apparel. Beyond the work of our teams to deliver these outstanding improvements, we're benefiting from a more than two-week reduction of import lead times compared with last year and a nearly 10 percentage point improvement in purchase order fill rates compared with a year ago.\nAnd with the combined benefit of a faster supply chain and a simultaneous reduction in inventory levels, all of our supply chain facilities stayed at or below our desired capacity thresholds through all 13 weeks of the Q3 this year, compared with only three of 13 weeks in Q3 of 2022.\nSo while we'll continue to focus on ways to consistently deliver higher in-stocks and reliability, I'm incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished so far this year. So now, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to highlight how our team continues to deliver on their efforts to improve execution of everyday retail fundamentals as we prepare for the busiest shopping season of the year.\nOne of the key areas of focus for our store teams this year was to ensure priority items remained available on our sales floors throughout the day. And this year, through these efforts, we've increased the amount of inventory available on our sales floors by more than $750 million. In addition, we've seen improvements in metrics relating to backroom inventory accuracy and the percent of new assortments set on time.\nIn the digital channel, the percentage of orders picked and shipped on time and the average Drive Up wait time have all improved from last year. Also, in support of the digital business, the percent of items ordered but not found has declined from a year ago, meaning that we're fulfilling more items per order and canceling fewer, a key factor in guest satisfaction.\nSince our goal is for Target to be the easiest place for our guests to shop, our teams have been focused on the front-of-store experience with a goal of providing consistently great service through the in-store checkout experience, along with Drive Up, and in-store pickup.\nAnd because our guests tell us they enjoy interacting with our team, since we've refocused on the front-end experience, we've seen more than a six percentage point increase in the usage of full-service lanes across the chain.\nWe've seen sustained month-over-month improvements in the Net Promoter Score relating to interactions with our team at checkout. In addition, compared with last year, we've seen improvements in Net Promoter Scores for both Drive Up and in-store pickup on top of already high levels a year ago. Beyond the front-of-store in support of our efforts to highlight value and affordability, our team has been working to increase the number of store end caps featuring one or two price points.\nAs a result, going into this holiday season, nearly 2/3 of our end caps were meeting the standard and conveying a simple, compelling, and easy-to-understand value message. Finally, I want to provide a quick update on our goal of hiring 100,000 seasonal team members to join our team and provide a great guest experience during the holiday season.\nI'm happy to report that our hiring stats this year have improved relative to last year. I'm confident our entire team will be energized and ready to support our guests throughout the busiest season of the year. So now, as I get ready to turn the call over to Michael, I want to quickly thank all of you for your continued interest and engagement with Target.\nI've been fortunate to meet and interact with many of you over the years, beginning with my time as CFO and continuing with my time leading operations. I also want to say to the entire Target team, thank you for everything I've learned from you, for your enduring passion for retail, and for your love of this iconic brand. I'll continue to be a huge supporter of this company and this team when I'm no longer on these calls.\nBecause of all of you, I know that the company and our guests are in very good hands, and I'll be cheering on your efforts from the sidelines. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. Before I begin my formal remarks, I want to thank you for the positive impact you've made on this company, our strategy, our team, and on me personally. I've been fortunate to work with you and learn from you since I first arrived at Target 20 years ago.\nIn Q3, total revenue was down 4.2%, reflecting a 4.3% decline in total sales and a 0.6% decline in other revenue. Within the other revenue line, declines in credit card revenue and a few smaller items were nearly offset by growth in Roundel ad revenue. Among the drivers of our Q3 comparable sales, traffic was down 4.1%, combined with a 0.8% decrease in average ticket.\nWhile we're encouraged that our Q3 comp trend improved half a point compared with Q2 and the traffic trend recovered a little bit faster, we're not at all satisfied with this result, and we're laser-focused on moving both traffic and sales trends back into positive territory.\nAs Christina mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments, so not surprisingly, Q3 comp performance was strongest around the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons. For the remainder of the quarter, we saw variability week by week with periods of relative strength around promotions.\nOur Q3 gross margin rate of 27.4% was more 2.5 points better than last year, driven by multiple benefits within merchandising, including meaningfully lower freight costs and favorable clearance markdowns. In addition, we benefited from year-over-year favorability in digital fulfillment and supply chain costs.\nPerhaps surprisingly, merchandise mix drove a small rate benefit compared with last year as we continued to benefit from growth in higher margin categories like beauty, and we saw the softest performance in very low margin categories like electronics. Partially offsetting these tailwinds, the rising cost of inventory shrink represented a 40 basis point headwind to our Q3 gross margin rate.\nWhile we're encouraged that this impact was smaller than expected and better than we faced earlier in the year, growth and shrink remains a significant financial headwind, and we're determined to continue making progress in the years ahead. While our Q3 guidance anticipated significant improvement in our gross margin rate, our actual performance was well above our expectations as the team delivered greater-than-expected progress on several fronts.\nAt the top of that list is their continued agility in managing inventory, which delivered compelling benefits on both the gross margin and SG&A expense lines. In addition, our team's ongoing efforts to identify long-term efficiency opportunities are already contributing to this quarter's better-than-expected performance.\nBeyond those drivers, a couple of macro factors came in better than expected, including freight costs and the impact of inventory shrink. On the SG&A line, our Q3 rate of 20.9% was just over a percentage point higher than last year. This growth reflected cost increases throughout our business, including continued investments in our team along with the deleveraging impact of lower sales, partially offset by disciplined cost management throughout the organization.\nOur Q3 depreciation and amortization expense rate of 2.4% was about 10 basis points higher than a year ago, reflecting dollar growth of about 3%.\nAltogether, our Q3 operating margin rate of 5.2% was more than a percentage point higher than last year. And notably, this year's rate was only about 20 basis points lower than the 5.4% our business delivered prior to the pandemic in the Q3 of 2019, despite the cumulative 110 basis point drag from shrink we faced since then.\nAlso important, given the growth in revenue that our team has delivered over that four-year period, this year's Q3 operating margin dollars were more than 30% higher than in 2019. As a result, on the bottom line, both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 in this year's Q3 were more than 36% ahead of last year and more than 50% higher than in 2019.\nImportant to note, while the backdrop today remains tough, because of the long-term investments we continue to make and the efforts of our team to identify efficiency opportunities throughout our business, we have a lot more opportunity to grow both our top line and increase our profitability in the years ahead. Our team is already delivering strong profit performance, both compared to a year ago and versus our longer-term history as well.\nNow I'll turn to capital deployment and reiterate our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained for more than 50 years. And finally, we deploy any excess cash within the limits of our investment-grade credit ratings through share repurchase over time.\nRegarding the first priority, capital investment through the first 3/4 of the year was just under $4 billion, and we expect full-year CapEx will be near the high end of the $4 to $5 billion range we laid out for the year.\nWhile we're still in the early stages of developing next year's capital plan, our current expectation is that next year's CapEx will be somewhat lower than this year in the $3 to $4 billion range, reflecting our current view of the optimal timing for key investments we're planning over the next several years.\nRegarding our second capital priority, we paid dividends of just over $500 million in Q3, $10 million higher than last year, reflecting a per-share dividend increase of 1.9%.\nRegarding the last priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in the Q3 as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our middle-A credit ratings. We continue to make meaningful progress on that journey as the combined benefits of higher profits and lower working capital have led to a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow.\nMore specifically, our operations have generated more than $5.3 billion in cash through the first 3/4 of the year, up dramatically from about $550 million through the first 3/4 of 2022. As always, I'll conclude my review of the quarter with our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC, which was 13.9% in the Q3, down from 14.6% a year ago.\nWhile an after-tax return in the low teens is quite healthy in absolute terms, it's meaningfully lower than the returns we expect to deliver over time. Importantly, we've seen sequential improvement in this metric over the last couple of quarters, and we're focused on continuing that momentum in the years ahead. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the Q4.\nOn the top line, our expectations reflect our continued near-term caution, leading us to maintain our prior guidance for a mid-single-digit decline in Q4 comparable sales. On the bottom line, we're also maintaining a cautious posture, particularly because the Q4 is typically a very promotional season.\nAs such, we're planning a wide range for our Q4 EPS of $1.90 to $2.60, which represents approximately flat growth to last year on the low end and growth of about 37% on the high end.\nI also want to note that 2023 is a 53-week year, so the Q4 will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and result in about 30 basis points of operating margin rate leverage on the quarter. Note that it will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length.\nOn top of the results our team has already delivered through Q3, our Q4 guidance implies a full-year EPS range that's very close to the original guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year, with a midpoint less than $0.05 from the center of the original range.\nThat's an amazing outcome against the backdrop of a tougher-than-expected top line, and it's a testament to the tireless efforts of our team to stay nimble and successfully navigate through a volatile and unpredictable period. In fact, given how strong our profit rate performance has been so far this year, we've been getting some questions about whether we're only focused on increasing our profit rate, and I want to pause and address that question head-on.\nAs John mentioned earlier, coming into this year, we were confident our team would deliver a significant increase in our profit rate by achieving better alignment between our inventory and our sales. In addition, a year ago, we first talked about the significant long-term efficiency opportunities we're pursuing, given that we've grown our revenue to more than $100 billion per year.\nWhile that work is still in its early stages, the team has already delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of efficiency savings so far this year, significantly benefiting our profitability. But I want to make it clear: we are focused on growing profit dollars, and if we saw an opportunity to invest a portion of our current profit rate to gain sustainable long-term growth in dollars, we would gladly do that.\nEven more fundamentally, our first priority is to deliver long-term top-line growth because the only way a retailer can sustainably deliver bottom-line growth is by delivering top-line growth as well. At the same time, we're not interested in making any investments that might boost the top line in the short term but which wouldn't lead to any sustainable growth. In fact, our experience has shown that many times those kinds of short-term decisions are actually harmful over time.\nSo today, we remain focused on the long-term strategies that have been so successful in driving top-line growth over the last half-decade, including our work to enhance our assortment of both owned brands and national brands, our investments in our store assets, and our team to deliver a reliable and differentiated shopping experience, investments in new stores and markets we've not previously served, and in existing stores to keep them fresh, and enhancing our digital experience beginning with the website and Target app all the way through to the fulfillment services we provide.\nAs we pursue those long-term initiatives, we also have opportunity to further grow our operating margin rate in the years ahead, and we don't believe those efforts are incompatible with each other. But more directly, based on where we are today, we believe we can successfully deliver both top-line growth and rate improvement over time.\nAnd as always, the basis for my confidence starts and ends with the Target team. They've delivered unprecedented growth over the last several years, and this year they've made amazing progress in moving our profitability back toward the optimal level, all while focusing on building and maintaining long-term relationships with our guests. Our team is truly the best team in retail. Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to pause and acknowledge John's incredible record of service at Target and thank him for his profound impact he's had on this company. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I'm not planning to recap his entire 27th-year career this morning, but I do want to highlight the impact he's had since I arrived in 2014.\nAn impact that literally began on my first day when John handed me a large binder, a recap of the comprehensive strategy review he and the board conducted during his time as interim CEO. That body of work was an invaluable resource that allowed me to hit the ground running. It served as a blueprint for all the strategic changes we made in those early years.\nOne of those changes was the creation of a Chief Operating Officer role, the first time we've had one at Target. And while John was already an outstanding CFO, I knew he was the right person for this new position. Since becoming COO in 2015, John has led the transformation of our store portfolio from new stores to remodels to the operating model within those buildings.\nSimilarly, John is leading the transformation of our upstream supply chain, completely changing the way our distribution network serves our stores. Of course, John's team developed and implemented our stores as hubs strategy. When we launched stores as hubs, it was a completely unique approach in retail. It's a model that has changed the way we serve our guests, including Drive Up service.\nNow it accounts for well over $7 billion in annual sales. $7 billion is larger than the total sales of some other prominent retailers. But beyond the tangible operational changes John has led, it's his focus on team development and his impact on individual leaders that's been the most notable.\nJohn has served as both a formal and informal mentor to countless members of our team, and he's hired and developed an extraordinary group of leaders, including Mark Schindele in our stores and Gretchen McCarthy in our supply chain, both of whom are ready and well-prepared to continue leading the work after John steps down.\nPerhaps the strongest compliment I can pay John is to say he will be missed as a colleague, and I will personally miss his partnership. But I know our operations will not miss a beat, given how masterfully he's prepared everyone around him. And that goes for me too.\nSince the day I arrived, John has been a trusted advisor whose only goal was to do what was best for our guests, for this great company, and for our team.\nI should also reiterate that John will remain in his role through the end of this fiscal year and has agreed to continue in an advisory role until February 2025. We'll share additional information on our succession plans for John early next year.\nI'm sure I speak for all of us when I sincerely thank John for all he's done for Target and wish him only the best in his retirement. With that, we'll turn to Q&A. tina, John, Michael, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. To withdraw your request, press star two. One moment for the first question. Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nRobby Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, good morning. First, I just want to say congrats to Brian and team Target on a great quarter in a really tough environment, and to John Mulligan on just everything you've accomplished working at Target. But then my question is actually for Mr. Fiddelke. I was hoping that you could talk to us about how to think about the puts and takes on gross margin differences in, say, Q4 versus Q3.\nYou mentioned shrink was a little better. How should we think about that for the Q4? Also, freight versus what you saw in the Q3, what inventory management could bring in expectations for markdown ranges that we should think about for the Q4, say, versus the Q3 to give us something to think about?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, happy to start, Robbie. You had a couple of the drivers in your question. The Q3 relative benefits of shrink coming in a little better than we thought, freight coming in healthy on a year-over-year basis were certainly contributing factors. But the one I'd just underscore is the continued benefit we see from our strong inventory position.\nThe cautious approach we've taken to inventory and, frankly, the team's good work to drive more productivity with a better inventory position, that inventory position just reaps benefits across our operations. Our stores are more efficient. Our DCs are more efficient. The whole system just runs better with inventory where it sits today. And with inventory down 14% on the balance sheet as we exit the quarter, we feel really good about that inventory position heading into Q4.\n\nRobby Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd do you still expect shrink to be favorable year-over-year in the Q4?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and Incoming CEO and COO, Target Corporation\n\nSo that's probably worth spending just a second on so that we all interpret what we're likely to see in Q4 the right way. Given the pace of some of our accruals last year, we would expect shrink to not be the quarter-over-quarter headwind in Q4 that we've seen throughout the balance of the year.\nImportant to note that that doesn't mean we've turned the corner on shrink. We'll continue to watch those trends carefully, and we still saw year-over-year pressure in Q3 as the underlying shrink in the business is still a headwind on a year-over-year basis. But there's some things unique to last year in Q4 that are likely to make it less of a driver of year-over-year variance in that quarter.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nRobbie, I might build on Michael's comments around inventory. We certainly feel very good about the actions we've taken and the reduction of inventory by 14%. If you heard Christina earlier in the call, we've also been leaning into newness and feel really good about our position going into the holiday season with 10,000 new items, and we'll continue to lean in to meet demand during the holiday season.\nI think the team's done an exceptional job of managing inventory. The benefits throughout our system have been realized in Q3, but we're playing to win in Q4. I think Christina highlighted the amount of newness we have in our system and the great value we'll offer our guests throughout the holiday season.\n\nRobby Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThat sounds great. Best of luck. Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst for Food, Grocery, and Consumer Products, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So just for the holiday season, just curious if there's any early reads you can share and then any commentary just in terms of what you're seeing quarter to date.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, as you might expect, we're watching it day by day, almost hour by hour, but we're still really early in the season. The big days, the big weeks are still in front of us. So we'll watch it carefully. Again, I think we're prepared for a really solid holiday season, but it's just way too early to tell.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst for Food, Grocery, and Consumer Products, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then maybe one follow-up question. Just on the CapEx, so expectations are lower for next year. Any specific buckets where you guys expect to reduce CapEx spending next year? Just any initial color you can share.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. You can expect us to unpack that more as we get into the start of next year, Rupesh, but wanted to share our latest thinking of how we think the cadence by year flows. And as you heard me say in my remarks, importantly, we'll continue to invest in the things that will drive growth over time.\nWe're really pleased with the almost $5 billion of investments this year and the returns those will drive. And we feel like that $3 to 4 billion number is the right number for next year based on what we see today, but more to come on that front.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst for Food, Grocery, and Consumer Products, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. I'll pass it along.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst for Hardlines, Broadlines, and Food Retail, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question, best of luck to John Mulligan.\nWith sales down around 5% in Q3 and the guys calling for a similar decline in Q4, one of the key debates, using an example, is, are customers not coming to Target right now because they're just not in the market for a coffee maker, as an example? Or are they buying that coffee maker somewhere else? And if the latter is the case, how much more promotional will Target need to become in order to get that customer back?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, I'm happy to start, and then I'll ask Christina to provide additional color. But one of the things that we've called out a number of times now is that there's tremendous pressure on the consumer's wallet and the impact of very sticky food and beverage inflation, which compared to pre-pandemic, food and beverage prices are up on average 25%.\nThat's certainly pressured consumers as they're making choices and certainly has forced them to make very tough choices when it comes to discretionary goods. We've actually seen in the industry seven consecutive quarters where discretionary goods have declined both in dollars and units. There's an overall pressure in the marketplace.\nYou're seeing a consumer who is focused on managing their budget, buying those household essentials, and then carefully shopping for those new items you just mentioned. But Christina, why don't you give Michael some additional color on what we're seeing in some of those categories?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah. To build on what Brian said, certainly when we do have hot promotions, the guest is responding. The Q4 is always very competitive, and we'll be very well positioned with everyday low prices as well as promotions, and investments in Circle, our loyalty program.\nI think the big difference for us this year in this Q4 is the amount of newness that we've invested in. If there's one thing that we've seen is in an environment where people are making choices and they might have some constraints with their budget, the motivation to buy is really, is this going to add value to my life? Is this something that is intriguing and feels relevant or is fashion-forward or is really for me?\nAnd doing more of the same just isn't going to get it done, which is why we've invested in newness. And you'll see that across the store. You'll see it as you walk in, first thing in our women's set. It's right on trend. It's colorful. The price points are very appealing. You walk around to our seasonal business. Right now, you can get everything from your tree to your tree skirt to ornaments at a great value.\nContinue down the path to toys. You've got over 2/3 of our toys below $25. And then around the corner of our store to food, where you can get not only your Thanksgiving meal for under $25, but all the gifting solutions and special treats from Marks & Spencer, only rounded out at Beauty, which has been our strongest business year to date for many years, and find gifting solutions at every price point. So, we're really pleased with the assortment we're putting forward and think this will certainly motivate the guests to buy.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAnd Michael, one point to clarify. While we've certainly called out the pressure we're seeing, both from an industry standpoint and a Target standpoint in discretionary categories, in the Q3 alone, we generated over $25 billion of revenue. As Michael referenced, on a full-year basis, we'll generate over $100 billion of revenue. A significant portion of that comes from discretionary sales.\nAs Christina pointed out, much of that's tied to combining great newness with affordability. I think we're well positioned to continue to perform in those categories. While we've seen some pressure, consumers continue to turn to Target for apparel and home for discretionary categories and items. I think we're well positioned with the amount of newness and value we'll offer during the holiday season.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst for Hardlines, Broadlines, and Food Retail, UBS\n\nThank you very much for that. My follow-up question is, Brian, over the last couple of years, Target has shown that it can drive sales growth. It's now showing that it can drive profitability. As you look towards 2024, when arguably the consumer is going to continue to face pressure, will your priority be on driving better sales performance or sustaining the profitability that Target's been able to achieve this year?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, it's such a great question. You heard me say this in my prepared comments. Our focus is on obviously doing both. We're certainly not satisfied today with our top-line performance, and we are laser-focused on improving traffic, on growing our top line, and continuing to advance our profitability. So for Target, it's a combination of doing both.\nAs we finish this year and build our plans for 2024, you'll see us being focused on driving our top line, building traffic, and continue to expand our profitability.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst for Hardlines, Broadlines, and Food Retail, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\n\nEdward Yruma\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst for Global Lifestyle Brands, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, guys.\nThanks for taking the questions. John Mulligan, congratulations on all that you've done, and thanks for all the help over the years. Really just a couple of clarification questions. So Michael, on shrink, I know last year you had a significant accrual in Q4. You said that there's favorability, but just trying to understand the underlying trend. Are you seeing stabilization? And not to conflate two things, but I know you did call out kind of more usage of full-service lanes.\nSo trying to understand if you've kind of at least started to flatten the curve on shrink. And then as a follow-up on discretionary categories, obviously nice to see the improvement in apparel. Are you planning kind of continued improvement within that negative mid-single comp guide? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI'm happy to start with the shrink question, Ed. In the Q3, we still saw year-over-year pressure, so about 40 basis points of year-over-year headwind. That's less pressure, relatively, than we saw in the first two quarters of the year, and it was a little better than we thought it'd be. And so those are encouraging signs of some progress in the right direction, but to be clear, still a year-over-year headwind in Q3. And so, as we've said before, shrink's a lagging metric.\nWe think progress there probably doesn't happen quickly, but we're focused on progress over time, and you'll see us continue to take the actions to get a better outcome there over time, but it's not one that we'd expect overnight.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nAnd on the discretionary side, I said it in my prepared remarks, but there was an underlying shift in the Q3 compared to the Q2 with both apparel and home accelerating nicely. And so that's our continued goal, is to make sure that we present the right level of newness to build the business back to positive territory over the long term. We are, however, picking our bets, and so our cautionary planning to inventory has bought us so much goodness in the total P&L on the operation that it's about being choiceful and placing our bets.\n\nEdward Yruma\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst for Global Lifestyle Brands, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sacks\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk to traffic trends by month throughout the quarter and just wondered how much better traffic in the Q3 versus Q2 was driven by customers coming back after what we saw in June.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. So, when we think about what we see in traffic, as you heard in our prepared remarks, it was good to see sequentially traffic improve quarter-over-quarter at a slightly faster rate than the top line did. We're excited about the work teams do, that balance of newness and value, and the investments we continue to make in the business to turn traffic back in our favor over time. So that's where you'll see us focused, Kate.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sacks\n\nOkay. Thank you. Then our follow-up question is just around promotions. Are you seeing any kind of increase in vendor support when it comes to promotions versus what you saw last year?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nAs we've talked about, the consumer is responding to promotions, and so the market is responding accordingly. With that said, I'd say it's still a rational environment. The healthy inventory position that we're in allows us to continue to offer great value to our guests without chasing empty calories.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nKate, I might offer just one more piece of context on traffic. Even with the tougher sales trends that we've seen so far year to date, through the first 3/4 of this year versus pre-pandemic, traffic's up over 20% in total. We feel really good about the engagement that we've built with guests over the last few years.\nWe think that's an asset and a base that will really benefit us well going forward.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sacks\n\nThank you. And John Mulligan, congratulations.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. You may go ahead.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Good morning. And I wanted to ask, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from unit perspective in terms of unit sales? And I know, as you mentioned in the transcript, that units are down a little bit, but are you starting to see any stabilization there? And how should we think about unit sales going forward? And also, if you could touch on the grocery aspect of that as well, I'd be curious, or essentials, I should say.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Brian hit on this in his prepared remarks that the industry has seen a slowdown in unit performance over many quarters in a row.\nThat is because the pressure on the consumer is really real, and they're having to make those choices. I also shared in my remarks that in the frequency businesses, which we think of as food and beverage, essentials, and beauty, that in Q3, we saw prices come down so that we comped over the peak of inflation. The prices came down. That's an industry-wide phenomenon.\nAs a result, we did see some improvement in unit velocity. That's a good thing in the long run, is that when consumers can stretch their budget across more things that they want to buy and not have it tied up in these high prices; that's a good thing.\nBut as Brian talked about, the inflation on these categories over the last several years, especially in food, household essentials, even pets and baby, it's meaningful, and that's going to take a while to overcome.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOperator, we've got time for two more questions today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst for Retailing Broadlines and Hardlines and Food Retailers, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I want to go back to this market share, or not market share, actually sales versus margin. And I'm curious if you can speak to market share, if that is a gauge you're looking at, what happened during the quarter. And is the decision around this trade-off, is it market share dependent, and are there certain categories you're looking at, thinking about when to apply promotions or where to apply promotions?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nSo right now, with total consumer spending soft in the discretionary portfolio, we are not going to chase short-term benefit at the expense of long-term. It's always a balance. We're always looking to drive both sales and profit. We've also been very clear that this year we put profit on a high priority to recover from prior years. But as Brian said, the long-term game has to be both.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAgain, I'll underscore the point Christina just made. Simeon, I think you know it's all about the balance. We're always looking to balance our focus on sales, margin, and profitability. Early in the year, we talked about the fact that we were going to plan discretionary categories cautiously in this environment, and we said appropriately. I think that's played out well for us.\nBut at the same time, we've been leaning into categories with strong demand in food and beverage, in household essentials, in beauty. We know today's consumer is still celebrating seasons, so we leaned into back to school, back to college, and Halloween. We know they're going to celebrate the holiday season. So we're leaning into those select categories where we know the guest is looking for newness, affordability, and they're going to celebrate those seasons.\nBut that's what we do each and every day as a good retailer. It's constantly a balance, category by category, of the focus on sales, on market share, and on profitability. I think, as you saw in the Q3, that played out well for us.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst for Retailing Broadlines and Hardlines and Food Retailers, Morgan Stanley\n\nA quick follow-up: sortation centers. Do you have a sense of what the savings look like? Do you have enough scale and experience with them to know what the savings will be? And is that a 2024? Do we start to see the savings next year?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, you've opened up the door for John Mulligan to answer a question today, and I'm really glad you did.\n\nJohn Mulligan\n\nCOO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks for that, Simeon. I would start by saying we remain incredibly excited about sortation centers. And with that, we have already started to see savings flow through the P&L.\nWe haven't talked about it because I think it's been three years, but we are still early in the journey. I think there's so much still in front of us. We're still optimizing routes. We're still just getting into much higher capacity vehicles, which will create more density, which will create more savings.\nThen we've said over the next few years, we've got at least five more of these to open. As we get the digital business growing again, hopefully that number goes up as well. We're still in the early days, but we remain very optimistic because we are seeing savings. It's much faster than the alternative. We know the next best alternative we are operating well below from a cost perspective.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOperator, we've got time for our final question. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nManaging Director of Global Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Congratulations to John. It's been an incredible journey, and I hope you have a wonderful retirement. I'll follow up on the operating margin question for next year.\nMichael, maybe you could talk about the puts and takes as you think about next year. Clearly, the consumer's the question. But as you think about shrink versus maybe some incremental promotion when you're not so lean on the inventory side versus what you might see from Roundel, and you also have the $2 to 3 billion cost savings program.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, thanks for the question, Chris. I think the punchline is we'll talk more about next year after we get through a really important holiday season. So that's our team's focus right now. And a lot of what we'll unpack as we get there will be some of the things that you listed in your questions before the comment as we turn the page to next year once we get through a really important Q4.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nManaging Director of Global Research, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Thanks very much. Great. Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOperator, that concludes our Q3 call. I want to thank everybody for joining us. I wish everybody a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to seeing you in March.",

Finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the Q2 and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThanks, John, and good morning everyone. In Q2, our team and our business model showed remarkable resilience in the face of multiple headwinds in the external environment. While these headwinds have led to a temporary slowdown in the pace of our business, that doesn't mean our team is standing still. Throughout the company, our team remains focused on staying agile and flexible as we continue to serve our guests and to listen carefully to them in this very dynamic environment. We're fortunate to have a business model that's inherently flexible by design. We offer a balanced, multi-category assortment that's focused on our guests' wants and needs, allowing us to stay relevant in any environment and to quickly pivot as our guest priorities change.\nOur unique stores-as-a-hub model, a concept we pioneered in the retail industry, allows us to serve our guests quickly, flexibly, and reliably on every shopping journey, whether it takes place in a store or on a digital device. By continuously listening to, learning from, and engaging with our guests, and then refining our playbook with our insights, we'll continue to achieve our purpose of delivering everyday joy for all the families we serve while reinforcing our strong culture of caring, growing, and winning together. As you'll recall, in the first half of 2022, we were faced with excess inventory driven by a rapid change in consumer spending patterns. In the face of that challenge, the team took important steps a year ago, allowing us to quickly adjust our inventory down to the proper level.\nThose critical decisions have allowed our team to operate efficiently while focusing on serving our guests. They've enabled the presentation of fresh, seasonally appropriate assortments throughout the year and provided the flexibility to lean into share opportunities in key seasons like back to school and back to college. Importantly, last year's inventory actions laid the groundwork for the recovery and profitability we've achieved so far this year. Our team also played a critical role in our Q2 profit performance.\nAs we began to see softening sales trends early in the quarter, the team in our stores and supply chain responded with speed and agility. Their discipline, along with ongoing efficiency efforts, allowed our profit performance to exceed our original expectations despite a meaningful shortfall on the top line. More specifically, for the quarter just ended, operating income expanded by more than $800 million compared with a year ago.\nDespite the fact we've experienced more than a percentage point of cumulative profit pressure from higher shrink since 2019, our EPS of $3.86 through the first half of the year is more than 15% higher than in 2019. While this is encouraging progress, we are confident we'll see further meaningful increases in our profitability over time. On the top line, Q2 results were below our expectations, as comparable sales decreased by 5.4%. Within the quarter, comp trends softened from the second half of May into June, before we saw a meaningful recovery in both traffic and comps in July. In the month, we were especially pleased with trends around Independence Day holiday, along with Circle Week, which also resulted in the addition of more than 500,000 new Target Circle members.\nConsistent with recent interesting trends, Q2 comps reflected continued growth in our frequency categories, offset by notable softer results in our more discretionary categories. Cross-channel sales were strongest in our stores, while results in our digital channel were led by continued growth in our drive-up service. Consistent with our stores-as-hub strategy, more than 97% of our Q2 sales were fulfilled by our stores. As we've described for more than a year now, the divergence of sales trends between our frequency and discretionary categories is being driven by multiple cross-currents that are affecting the US consumer.\nThese include the impact of inflation in frequency categories like food and beverage, and essentials, causing these categories to absorb a much higher portion of consumers' budgets. In addition, consumers are choosing to increase spending on services like leisure travel, entertainment, and food away from home, putting near-term pressure on discretionary products.\nFinally, the rollback of government efforts to support consumers during the pandemic, including stimulus payments, enhanced childcare tax credits, and the suspension of student loan payments, presents an ongoing headwind that consumers continue to manage. Beyond these factors in the Q2, many of our store team members faced a negative guest reaction to our pride assortment. As you know, we have featured a pride assortment for more than a decade. However, after the launch of the assortment this year, members of our team began experiencing threats and aggressive actions that affected their sense of safety and well-being while at work. I want to make it clear, we denounce violence and hate of all kinds, and the safety of our team and our guests is our top priority.\nTo protect the team in the face of these threatening circumstances, we quickly made changes, including the removal of items that were at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior. Pride is one of many heritage moments that are important to our guests and our team, and we'll continue to support these moments in the future. They are just one part of our commitment to support a diverse team, which helps us serve a diverse set of guests. As we talk to these guests, they consistently tell us that Target is their happy place, somewhere they can go to escape and recharge. As we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we're committed to staying close to our guests and their expectations at Target.\nSpecific to pride and heritage months, we're focused on building assortments that are celebratory and joyous, with wide-ranging relevance, being mindful of timing, placement, and presentation, leaning into segmentation and leveraging our digital experience, and reconsidering the mix of own brands, national brands, and external partners within these assortments. Our goal is to ensure we continue to celebrate moments that are special to our guests, while acknowledging that every day, for millions of people, they want Target to serve as a refuge in their daily lives. In addition to these more recent challenges, our team continues to face an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime. As you'll hear in more detail from Michael, shrink in Q2 remained consistent with our expectations, but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time.\nUnfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction. During the first five months of this year, our stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence. As a result, we're continuing to work tirelessly with retail industry groups and community partners to find solutions to promote safety for our store teams and our guests. Looking ahead, as you'll hear from both Christina and John, our team is focused on moving forward and preparing for the biggest seasons of the year.\nGiven the current consumer and economic backdrop, we've adjusted our guidance for the remainder of the year consistent with a cautious planning approach that has served us so well during the first half of the year. Against this cautious backdrop, our team is laser-focused on delivering newness, quality, and affordability, reinforced by a commitment to retail fundamentals.\nGiven the rapid growth and the volatility our business has experienced over the last several years, we have an opportunity to refocus our team on four key factors that determine where consumers choose to shop: being reliably in stock, highlighting affordability throughout our assortment, presentation, and marketing, leveraging the proximity of our stores to the guests we serve, while ensuring a seamless, differentiated, easy, and inspiring guest experience on every trip, every day. These areas have always been a source of strength, and we want to ensure we continue to differentiate our experience from our competitors. Within our merchandising, we'll continue to invest in our industry-leading own brand portfolio, along with the expansion of key national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Levi's, Apple, and Disney.\nWe'll focus on deepening the relationship with over 100 million Target Circle members and leveraging the power of our Roundel ad business to integrate relevant offers and promotions throughout the fall. We'll continue to drive awareness of our industry-leading drive-up service and highlight the recent addition of new guest-focused options, including drive-up returns and the ability to have a Starbucks beverage delivered with your order. Of course, we'll also continue to invest in our physical assets, positioning us for continued future growth. The bulk of these investments are happening in our stores as we add new locations, complete full store remodels, enhance the efficiency of our same-day services, and add new locations for our Ulta Beauty partnership, Disney Store concept, or enhanced Apple experience.\nIn the supply chain, we're continuing to invest in upstream replenishment capabilities, along with the expansion of our network of sortation centers, which delivered meaningful savings while increasing the speed of our last-mile delivery. Now, before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take stock of where our business is today. I think it's helpful to pull back the lens because 2023 is the fourth year in a row in which the external backdrop has been far different from anything we've ever experienced. Yet today, as a result of our team's consistent efforts to listen, understand, and serve our guests, Target is a much different company than it was four years ago. We have the right strategy, guest relevance, and team to deliver sustainable long-term growth.\nThrough the first half of 2023, our total revenue of just over $50 billion was about 39% higher than the $36 billion we delivered in 2019. This growth reflects significant increases across our entire business in all five merchandising categories, in both our stores and digital channels, and in our Roundel ad business. This growth reflects an increase in guest engagement as measured by the number of visits they're making to Target. Today, despite the challenges we've faced in recent quarters, the number of guest trips through the first half of 2023 was more than 169 million higher, or more than 21% higher than in 2019. Our team delivered this growth during a time of exceptional uncertainty and volatility. I want to end my remarks by acknowledging that accomplishment.\nI also want to recognize the team members in our stores and distribution centers for the way they've quickly responded to the recent and unexpected slowdown in our top-line sales trends. It's because of their discipline and agility that we've continued to provide an outstanding shopping experience while delivering better-than-expected profitability so far this year. On behalf of all our stakeholders, I want to thank our entire team for their continued extraordinary efforts. Now, I'll turn the call over to Christina.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nChief Growth Officer, Target\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. Despite the multiple headwinds we were facing on the top line, there were a number of things to like in the Q2. Of the many notable bright spots, our team's agile execution in service of our guests and each other rises to the top. Consumers continue to face difficult choices with every purchase.\nWhether managing their budgets in the face of higher prices or planning for resuming student loan payments, our guests are facing multiple ongoing challenges. With inflation rates moderating, however, we've started to see consumer confidence begin to recover from recent lows. While we're maintaining an appropriately cautious outlook today, we're hopeful that conditions can improve with time. In the meantime, even as consumers continue to spend with caution, our guests continue to embrace newness and seasonally relevant moments, all with an unwavering focus on affordability. In Q2, comparable sales were down 5.4%, softer than our expectations coming into the quarter. Frequency categories continue to grow, partially offsetting the softness we saw in discretionary categories. Essentials and beauty grew in the mid-single digits, led by beauty, which delivered comp growth in the low double digits.\nWithin our beauty offering, core beauty delivered double-digit growth, while sales from Ulta Beauty at Target more than doubled compared with a year ago, showing why we're so enthusiastic about this exclusive partnership. Food and beverage sales grew in the low single digits, and we saw particular strength in snacks, candy, and beverages. Conversely, discretionary categories softened further from recent trends with apparel, home, and hard lines, all seeing comp declines in the low double digits to mid-teens in Q2, several percentage points softer than in Q1.\nEven as trends in these categories remain quite soft overall, there are pockets of newness that are working quite well, and we're doubling down on investments in those areas. For example, our entertainment business within hard lines continues to see healthy growth in the mid-single digits, driven by newness in books and renewed growth in vinyl records.\nWith that in mind and knowing how our guests can't get enough of Taylor Swift, we proactively secured an exclusive vinyl offering that Swifties bought in droves. Additionally, in home, we've seen incredible demand for Stanley tumblers and cups, so we worked in partnership with Chip and Joanna Gaines to add exclusive new colors to the line as part of our beloved own brand, Hearth & Hand, found only at Target. As you heard from Brian, we anticipated some of the headwinds at play throughout the Q2, including the continued pullback in discretionary spending. Other headwinds were incremental, including the strong reaction to this year's pride assortment. Our goal is for our assortment to resonate broadly and deliver on the Target brand promise.\nIn this case, the reaction is a signal for us to pause, adapt, and learn so that our future approach to these moments balances celebration, inclusivity, and broad-based appeal. As we move ahead, we're confident that if we stay close to our guests, consistently execute on our retail fundamentals, and continue investing in our assortments, services, and experiences, we will position Target for continued growth over the long term. After all, as a guest-led company, we have been listening to and learning from our guests for decades. As an example, last year, we heard loud and clear that Target Circle members love exclusive events. So we repurposed last year's deal days and made our Target Circle week in July bigger than ever with incremental promotions and new ways to engage.\nIn fact, we enrolled well over 500,000 new guests during this event alone, more than 3.5 times higher than in an average week. Additionally, beauty guests told us for years how they would love the convenience of completing their beauty trip with access to prestige beauty products while shopping at Target. This led to the development of a unique partnership with Ulta Beauty to meet those needs. Today, based on the strong results we've seen so far, we continue to expand the footprint of these new shop-in-shops. When our guests, who already love our drive-up service, told us that they wanted us to add Starbucks and the ability to make returns, we quickly built, piloted, and are now rolling out those capabilities across the chain, and we're seeing incredibly high net promoter scores from our guests.\nWell before the recent release of the long-awaited Barbie movie, we collaborated with our vendor partners to secure exclusive items across multiple categories while adding a splash of pink style for Barbie fans of all ages. Barbie, along with Disney's The Little Mermaid, are the most recent examples of our long record of success in securing timely, relevant product lines supporting key movie licenses across toys, apparel, home, beauty, and food, which have allowed us to consistently capture between 30% and 60% market share with these properties. While we continue to take a conservative inventory position overall, these examples show that we are still leaning into key opportunities. We know our guests want to celebrate culturally and seasonally relevant moments, and we'll be leaning into those moments in a big way in Q3 and the upcoming holiday season.\nOur guests have told us that affordability, availability, and an easy, convenient, and consistently joyful shopping experience are more important than ever. While I've shared in prior calls that we're always focused on retail fundamentals, we're further sharpening our focus on four key aspects: comprehensive affordability, in-stock levels, leveraging our proximity to our guests, and the overall shopping experience. For a great example, look no further than our back-to-school and back-to-college assortments. We know our guests are approaching back-to-school with a value-conscious, deal-driven mindset, so we're leaning into savings for teachers and college students, including our 20% off teachers' appreciation and student savings events. We're also featuring ultra-low everyday prices all season long, with school supplies starting as low as $0.25 and key items such as lunchboxes and graphic tees at compelling $5 price points.\nJust in time for back-to-school, we're launching new Good & Gather products, including an assortment of new lunchbox-sized items. Back-to-college is always a big season for Target. This year, we're leaning into affordability as well as proximity to college-bound students. This includes strategic inventory bets and allocations in key markets where there are the greatest market share opportunities to ensure we're in stock and ready to play offense during this critical season. Of course, affordability goes well beyond a single season like back-to-school. In fact, with many consumers making their decisions on where to shop based on affordability, we're highlighting the comprehensive value we provide through our 30+ billion-dollar own brand portfolio. For example, Threshold, our flagship own brand in home, just received a major facelift.\nWith new branding, stronger price points, and a clarified aesthetic to help guests mix and match affordable styles for their homes, this beloved brand will be even easier to love. Just in time for the holidays, we'll be launching new own brands while expanding others, including the launch of a new kitchenware line that will make everyday meal prep easier while offering incredible quality and durability. Look for lots of newness on store shelves and online later this fall. As John will cover in more detail, we continue to invest heavily in our in-store experience, which starts with new stores and remodels that incorporate our latest and greatest offerings, including Apple, Levi's, and Disney experiences, as well as the additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations.\nJust like we remodel our stores to reflect our latest thinking and guest feedback into the shopping experience, we'll begin rolling out a remodel of our digital experience this quarter. Based on guest feedback, we're investing to create a digital experience that enhances the love of discovery while balancing the ease of navigation. This will include different landing experiences, more personalized content, enhanced search functionality, ease of navigation, and other updates to bring more joy and convenience to our digital guests.\nThrough it all, our teams continue to exhibit a commitment to excellence in the pursuit of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. Regardless of the external environment, our team consistently shows up and rises to the moment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside such a talented team. Thank you for all you do to bring that Target magic to life day in and day out.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nThanks, Christina. Like Brian and Christina, I want to start by thanking our amazing team. This quarter's better-than-expected profitability was a testament to their agility and resilience as they successfully managed through multiple challenges. While the team deserves credit for this performance, they got an assist from this year's leaner inventory position, which offered more room to maneuver than a year ago when the team was dealing with excess inventory. This year, with uncluttered facilities, a renewed focus on retail fundamentals, and our continued work to enhance efficiency, the team delivered an impressive increase in profitability in the face of a challenging top line. Across the entire supply chain, we're benefiting from much more favorable conditions than a year ago.\nPerhaps most notable is in global shipping, where Q2 import lead times were nearly 30 days shorter than last year and within a couple of days of pre-pandemic levels. In our domestic supply chain, because of strong partnership with our vendors, we're seeing improvement on multiple performance metrics, including fill rates and on-time arrivals. At our regional distribution centers, inbound backlogs have been reduced by more than a day since last year.\nIn the new flow centers we've opened over the last couple of years, we're also seeing improvements across multiple performance metrics as these new buildings continue to scale up toward capacity. In support of their primary role in replenishing store inventory, these facilities were designed and equipped to support our stores-as-hub strategy with newly developed automation that can assemble customized, pre-sorted, and sequenced shipments for every store they serve.\nWith these shipments, stores see faster replenishment times, require less labor to unload a trailer, and maintain lower levels of backroom inventory. More precisely, stores being serviced by these new facilities have seen a 20% reduction in lead times, enabling them to respond more quickly to changes in guest demand. Also notable, stores serviced by these new facilities are benefiting from improvements in in-stock levels while maintaining lower levels of backroom inventory. Beyond store replenishment, we're operating these new flow centers in a way that's unique within the industry. In the same way we pioneered ways to leverage the proximity, inventory, and assets in our stores to quickly and efficiently fulfill digital orders, we're leveraging those same characteristics of our flow centers to fulfill certain digital orders beyond their primary role in replenishing store inventories.\nIn light of our focus on retail fundamentals throughout the supply chain, our stores are seeing meaningful improvements in their in-stocks, even with 17% lower inventory on our balance sheet than a year ago. In Q2, overall in-stocks were a full percentage point better than Q1 and more than two points better than last year. We've seen even bigger improvements on our top items and in our top stores. This year, we saw meaningfully better in-stocks on key seasonal programs, including back-to-school, and back-to-college than we saw a year ago.\nOur new Flow Centers are delivering outstanding results. These facilities operate downstream from our stores and help to increase the speed and efficiency of last-mile delivery. Up to 70% of the packages processed by these facilities stay in the local market, allowing us to partner with Shipt to handle the last mile.\nThis integration with Shipt allows us to achieve meaningful efficiency and cost savings while offering much greater speed of delivery to our guests. More specifically, in markets where we operate a sortation center, the average click-to-deliver time is nearly one and a half days shorter than the network average, with about 1/3 of the packages arriving in only one day. As we continue to open new buildings and test and iterate on their operating model, we expect these speed metrics will continue to improve in the future. Today, based on the proven success of this strategy, we have 10 sortation centers already operating and expect to open at least six more over the next few years.\nThis current group of Sortation Centers is expected to process more than 35 million packages in 2023, representing a more than 20% increase from a year ago and a more than six-fold increase from 2021. As I described in our call three months ago, store teams this year have been focused on reinforcing best practices that support the retail fundamentals Christina highlighted earlier. In particular, this year, we've been investing to provide incremental training and reporting on several key factors that play a critical role in providing a great shopping experience, including staffing and scheduling, setting, filling, and replenishing merchandise presentations, and protecting the safety of our guests and our team. Throughout this year, our store teams have been progressing through a strategically sequenced training program designed to reinforce these best practices at key moments like back-to-school and back-to-college.\nThe goal is to provide an elevated, consistent experience every day in every store across the country. Since we've rolled out this training, we've seen broad-based improvement on performance metrics tied to critical guest outcomes, including pricing accuracy, locating items for digital orders, and setting key seasonal programs more quickly and completely. In support of the goal of achieving greater consistency in the level of execution across our nearly 2,000 stores, we've implemented a new rapid response process to help individual locations recover more quickly when they begin to see a decline in key metrics.\nAlso in stores, as Christina mentioned, we are really pleased with the early results from nationwide rollout of Drive-Up returns and the ability to add a Starbucks order to a Drive-Up trip. We've long said that Drive-Up receives the highest satisfaction rating of any service we provide.\nAs proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we continually push ourselves to find new ways to further differentiate Drive-Up. When we asked our guests how we could do that, they told us that adding Starbucks and taking returns were at the top of their list. To ensure that we could consistently execute on these new services while maintaining the high bar we've attained for satisfaction, we applied a disciplined test and iterate approach to the rollout, beginning with small-scale tests in the second half of 2022.\nFollowing a successful test of Drive-Up returns, we launched the service nationwide in April and May, and the results have been outstanding. Once a guest arrives at a Drive-Up lane, the average wait time for a team member to process their return is within three minutes, consistent with our standards for a traditional Drive-Up order.\nAs we began testing the addition of Starbucks to Drive-Up and given the complexities of making and promptly delivering a hot or cold beverage after a guest arrives, we wanted to put the process through an intensive period of testing and refinement. oday, based on what we've learned during the test period, we're confident we can scale up this service while consistently maintaining our service standards.\nAs a result, we're currently in the process of rolling out Starbucks at Drive-Up nationwide and plan to complete the rollout by the end of October, just in time for Pumpkin Spice Latte season. So now, before I finish my remarks, I want to provide a brief update on this year's new store openings. As you know, we plan to open about 20 new locations this year, ranging in size from 20,000 to 137,000 sq ft.\nIn Q2, we completed and opened another five new stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 11. Highlight of our Q2 projects was the opening of our first new offshore location since 2021, a new store in the Oahu Windward Mall, bringing our store count in Hawaii up to nine. At 132,000sq ft and featuring a Starbucks, Ulta Beauty, CVS, snack bar, and 18 drive-up stalls, this is one of the largest stores we'll open in 2023. I'm happy to say that it had one of the strongest openings of the year, reflecting outstanding execution by our team. Like our other stores in Hawaii, this new location is expected to be one of the most productive in the chain. During its first week, it generated the second highest sales volume out of the most recent 175 stores we've opened.\nI also want to pause and acknowledge the devastating wildfires that have hit Maui and Hawaii. Thankfully, members of our team there are safe, though some have lost homes, had to evacuate, or are providing shelter for family and friends. Our nearby stores remain open, helping guests to get much-needed essentials while donating masks and other emergency supplies. In addition, Target has announced a $1 million donation to help national and local disaster partners. Our team member giving fund is collecting donations from team members across the country to help their colleagues impacted by these wildfires. As I turn the call over to Michael, I want to end with where I started and highlight the tireless efforts of the best team in retail. The last four years have been anything but business as usual.\nAnd through it all, our team has consistently maintained their focus on what matters most: taking care of our guests and taking care of each other. I couldn't be more proud to work alongside them and learn from them every day. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Target\n\nThanks, John. As John just mentioned, our team and operating model continue to navigate through a host of challenges on the top line, but our business is showing its resilience. More specifically, we're really pleased with the strength of our Q2 profit performance, which further validates the cautious planning approach and lean inventory position we've maintained throughout the year.\nThis positioning, combined with our continued efficiency efforts, allowed us to make meaningful progress toward our profit recovery goals even in the face of softer-than-expected sales, giving us further confidence that our strategy is sound, we have the right team, and our business is positioned for continued progress in the years ahead. Total revenue was down 4.9% in Q2. Total sales also decreased by that same amount, while other revenue grew 1.3%. Within other revenue, we continued to see strong growth from our Roundel ad business, which offset declines in credit card profit sharing and other small income items compared with last year. Comparable sales were down 5.4% in Q2, reflecting a 4.8% decline in traffic. Among the factors affecting our top-line performance, comps and discretionary categories continue to reflect challenging trends in the industry, which softened further in Q2.\nA second factor was lower inflation in food, beverages, and essentials as we compared over peak inflation a year ago. Furthermore, traffic and top-line trends were affected by the reaction to our pride assortment, which launched in the middle of May. Lastly, our results reflected the comparison over last year's clearance and promotional activity, which affected weekly comp trends in certain categories, particularly in the digital channel.\nWhile each of these factors played a role in the quarter, it's not possible to reliably quantify the separate impact of each one. In terms of the monthly cadence in Q2, comp sales in May were down a little more than 3%, moved down to a decline of just over 7% in June, then made an encouraging recovery to -5% in July. Monthly traffic followed a similar cadence and actually recovered a bit faster than sales in July.\nEven with unexpectedly soft sales, inventories remain very well controlled. At the end of the Q2, balance sheet inventory was 17% lower than a year ago. This reflects our cautious planning approach, the agility of our team in responding to softer sales trends, and the benefit of a faster global supply chain, which enabled shorter lead times. Among our merchandising categories, discretionary inventory was down 25% at the end of Q2, partially offset by increases in our frequency categories and strategic investments and long-term share opportunities.\nImportantly, as John mentioned, even with much leaner inventories, we've seen meaningful in-stock improvements across our network. We were really pleased with our Q2 gross margin performance, which was enabled by our ongoing work to navigate this volatile environment. Our Q2 gross margin rate of 27% was 5.5 percentage points higher than a year ago.\nThis increase reflects multiple benefits within merchandising, including lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, along with the benefit of lower freight and transportation costs. Beyond merchandising, we also saw about a half a point of benefit in digital fulfillment and supply chain due to a lower mix of digital sales and a favorable mix of same-day services within the digital channel. Offsetting these benefits was a 90 basis point headwind from inventory shrink, in line with our expectations. One note, consistent with Q1, category mix did not affect our gross margin rate compared with last year, and we saw a similar deceleration across all five of our core merchandising categories between Q1 and Q2 of this year. Our Q2 SG&A expense rate was 1.7 percentage points higher than last year.\nThis increase reflects the deleveraging impact of lower sales combined with the impact of higher costs, including continued investments, pay and benefits for our team, and inflationary pressures throughout our business. These pressures were partially offset by disciplined cost management across our team. On the D&A expense line, the Q2 rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales on a 3.9% increase in dollars. Altogether, our Q2 operating margin rate of 4.8% was about four times higher than last year, reflecting a meaningful recovery from last year's inventory actions. On the bottom line, our Q2 GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1.80 was significantly higher than last year and above the high end of our guidance range.\nWhile we expected to see a big improvement in profitability this quarter, I can't emphasize enough the importance of our team's agility in delivering this performance, something that's even more notable given that shrink drove nearly a full point of profit pressure versus last year. Now I want to turn briefly to capital deployment and start with our priorities, which have served us well for decades. First, we fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria.\nThen we look to support our dividend and build on more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. And finally, we return any excess cash through share repurchase over time within the limits of our investment-grade credit ratings. So far this year, we've made capital expenditures of $2.8 billion and continue to expect full-year CapEx in the $4 to 5 billion range.\nIn the Q2, we paid $499 million in dividends compared with $417 million last year, reflecting a 20% increase in the per-share dividend. Finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in Q2 as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our investment-grade credit ratings. We're encouraged by the progress we've already made as the combined benefit of a significant profit recovery and lean inventory position have driven a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow.\nMore specifically, our operations have generated $3.4 billion in cash through the first half of this year, compared with a slightly negative number through the first half of last year. I'll end my comments on the quarter with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures our current profit performance in the context of our long-term investments.\nFor the Q2, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 13.7%. While still healthy in absolute terms and more than two percentage points higher than the Q1, it remains well below the level where we expect to operate over time. Now I'll turn to our expectations for Q3 and the remainder of the year. Today, as we assess the economic and industry backdrop, we continue to see a mixed picture. On the positive side, GDP, employment, and overall consumer spending have been resilient, and we're beginning to see a recovery in consumer confidence.\nOn the other side of the ledger, while we're happy to see inflation rates begin to moderate, that's likely to cause some near-term pressure on dollar comps in our frequency categories. In addition, the upcoming resumption of student loan repayments will put additional pressure on the already strained budgets of tens of millions of households.\nAgainst this backdrop, we remain cautious in our planning, an approach that has served us really well so far this year. On the top line, we're now planning for comparable sales in a wide range centered around a mid-single-digit decline for the remainder of the year, consistent with what we experienced in July and the Q2 overall. This updated sales expectation is meaningfully softer than our expectation at the beginning of the year. With this change in the top line, we've also adjusted our bottom line guidance and now expect full-year GAAP and adjusted EPS in the $7 to 8 range compared with our prior range of $7.75 to 8.75.\nWhile multiple factors will determine where our actual results line up in comparison to this expected range, the single most important variable will be the pace of our sales, as we're confident we'll continue to benefit from our efficiency efforts and lean inventory position. In the Q3, we're expecting GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.20 to 1.60 on a wide range of comparable sales centered around a mid-single-digit decline. In terms of quarterly EPS cadence, I want to take note of a couple of unique circumstances this year. The first is shrink and how that is expected to play out over the next two quarters. As I mentioned earlier, based on the high loss rates we're continuing to see, Q2 shrink was consistent with our expectations, and our full-year shrink expectations remain unchanged.\nHowever, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will look meaningfully different between Q3 and Q4. In Q3, we expect that dollar and rate pressure from shrink will be roughly consistent with the first half of the year at around 90 basis points. However, in Q4, we expect to see a small amount of year-over-year favorability from shrink. I want to stress that this anticipated change in quarterly comparisons does not reflect an expectation that underlying loss rates will begin to improve in Q4.\nAs Brian mentioned, we're working hard both inside our stores and with government and community partners to achieve lower loss rates over time. Our long-run expectation is that shrink rates will moderate from today's unsustainable levels. So far, we've only seen indications that loss rates might soon be reaching a plateau, but have not yet seen evidence that loss rates will begin to come down.\nThe only reason for the expected change in year-over-year comparisons is the cadence of how shrink was recognized by quarter in the back half of last year, a period when loss rates increased rapidly, resulting in higher shrink accruals at year-end. Because we've seen more consistent loss rates in 2023, quarterly accruals have been more consistent throughout this year. Another important consideration is that 2023 is a 53-week accounting year, so the Q4 will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that the extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and result in about 30 basis points of operating margin leverage on the quarter. I'll note that the extra week will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length.\nAs I get ready to end my remarks, I want to add my thanks to the entire Target team. From the flexibility they built into our business plans to their responsiveness in the face of this quarter's top-line volatility, and their continued work to enhance our long-term efficiency, they're clearly demonstrating their amazing resilience and showing why we're confident that we work with the best team in retail. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nBefore we turn to your questions, I want to pause and reinforce why we're so confident in our long-term prospects, which position us for profitable growth in the years ahead. Retail is an ongoing journey, a continuous process of listening to consumers and rapidly evolving to meet their preferences.\nTo do that well, you need to have the right assets in place, which allow you to quickly evolve as your guests' wants, needs, and preferences change. We're proud of the way we have built and strengthened Target's assets over the last decade. During this time, we pioneered and built a unique stores-as-hub model and invested in new supply chain capabilities to support that model. We invested billions of dollars in our existing store base, modernizing their shopping experience while optimizing those facilities to support digital fulfillment. We opened new locations in markets that had never been served by a Target store, and we continue to evolve our new store design. We developed and launched industry-leading same-day services, which received some of the highest guest satisfaction ratings of anything we do.\nWithin our assortment, we innovated to make our food and beauty businesses even stronger and gained huge amounts of market share along the way. We built an even stronger portfolio of industry-leading owned brands, which today generate more than $30 billion in annual sales. We also strengthened our portfolio of national brand partners, with Ulta Beauty as the most recent example. At the same time, we developed and launched our Roundel ad business, which leverages the power of our guest base and vendor relationships to deepen the bond between our guests, our vendors, and Target. We also built and launched Target Circle, which has quickly become one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States, providing us with even deeper insights about our guests and how we can serve them.\nFinally, we invested in our team, the best team in retail, by rapidly increasing their hourly wages and the benefits we provide while building stronger pathways to career development and advancement, and designing operational processes to enhance their safety and job satisfaction. With all of these assets in place today, we're not standing still. We're uniquely prepared to navigate into the future, including any uncertainties we'll face. We're committed to carefully listening to our guests and to our team and continuing to invest in capabilities and assets that will best serve our guests, even as their wants, needs, and expectations evolve from where they are today. Since no one knows what the future will bring and what new opportunities and challenges will arise, the company's best position to thrive over time are the ones with the tools to adapt.\nWith our stores, our brands, and our vendor partners, our capabilities, and our great team, we have everything we need to deliver long-term growth and success. With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. To withdraw your request, press star two. Our first question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you guys are seeing quarter to date, and then if you have any initial read on what you're seeing with the back-to-school season.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nMichael, I'm happy to start.\nRupesh, obviously, it's very early in the season, but for the first 10 days of August, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. They've been very consistent with what we saw in the month of July as guests turn to Target for their back-to-school and back-to-college shopping.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Target\n\nYeah, I don't have much to add to that. We knew the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons would be important for us. They always are. Second biggest seasonal moment for us, only next to the holiday season. It was a season where we expected to have some share opportunities. Like Brian said, 10 days in, so just getting started with the quarter, but we're pleased with what we see so far. The exciting thing about the balance of the year is we've got a lot of those seasonal moments to come.\nWe know our business performs so well across all categories in those seasonal moments.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nMichael, the only thing I would add as we think about back-to-school and particularly back-to-college is we expect the shopping season to extend into September, in fact, throughout the month of September. So we're off to a solid start. It's still very early, but we think this will be a back-to-school season that extends into September.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Then maybe one follow-up question. So, at your Analyst Day, you indicated expectations for achieving a 6% operating margin rate as early as FY24. Just given that weaker top line, is that still in the realm of possibility of getting up to 6% in your next fiscal year?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Target\n\nFair question, Rupesh, and one I'm sure we'll come back to over time. Right now, we're laser-focused on delivering a strong back half of the year.\nWe're pleased with the profit recovery we saw in the Q2. When we headed into this year, the path to 6% was paved with meaningful profit rate improvement in 2023. I couldn't be more thrilled with the progress the teams are making toward that, as evidenced by the strong profit performance in Q2. We'll continue to plan cautiously and set the team up for as much agility as possible in the back half of the year. I would expect that progression on profit to continue through the balance of this year, but more to come at the right time on what we think that long-term trajectory looks like.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nKate McShane\n\nRetail Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question.\nWe wondered if you could talk through gross margins maybe a little bit more. We were curious about how much more markdowns were versus planned, given the softness on the discretionary side and some of the merchandising challenges, and what was the offset, the meaningful offset there?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Target\n\nYeah, Kate, I'm happy to start and welcome Christina if you want to add any more color. The biggest story on the markdown front, I mean, I think we described the promotional environment is rational and really as expected for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Clearly, as you know, Kate, we saw meaningful improvement from last year's excess markdowns and costs to clear inventory. So, as you think about the five-plus point improvement in margin rate year-over-year, the vast majority of that improvement comes from being cleaner from an inventory perspective and saving those costs from last year.\nAgain, just one more example of by planning the business cautiously, by positioning with flexibility, and by the team reacting to some of the sales trends we saw in the quarter with urgency, we've been able to keep inventory really clean. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll see as clean of an inventory picture exiting the quarter as we started with, with inventories down 17% in total, down 25% in the discretionary categories. We feel well-managed on the inventory front, and that's showing up with markdowns playing out as expected.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nChief Growth Officer, Target\n\nYeah, Michael, I wouldn't have a lot to add. We're pleased with the team's agility, and we believe that the environment is rational, and we're continuing to build back our profit in light of the circumstances.\n\nKate McShane\n\nRetail Analyst, Goldman Sachs",
    "content2": "Thank you.\nOur follow-up question comes on the heels, I think, of the first question that was asked, but wanted to get a little bit more detail about any changes in consumer behavior within the discretionary categories, especially as traffic got better into July, and just how you're thinking of the discretionary categories in the back half of the year.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nYeah, Kate, I think we've continued to see the same trends over really the last year now. Well, I think we see a very resilient US consumer, and I think so much of that is fueled by the strength in the labor market. We continue to see a consumer who is facing high inflationary pressure in food and beverage and essential categories. That's absorbing a bigger portion of their wallet. I think as they think about discretionary spending, we've seen a rotation in their wallet from goods into services.\nYou're seeing the uptick in travel and leisure, what's happening in entertainment. Those trends we expect to continue into the back half of the year. We'll watch it carefully. I think our inventory position allows us the ability to chase into demand, and we'll be ready when we see demand changing as we enter the holiday season. I think the consumer is still taking a very cautious approach to discretionary spending in the goods sector.\n\nKate McShane\n\nRetail Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nRetail and Luxury Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nEverybody, thanks. Regarding traffic, what's your forecast for traffic that's embedded in guidance? Do you expect it to continue to be in the negative low or negative mid-single digit range?\nAlso, as we dive a little deeper into the discretionary product assortment, what do you see as opportunities in apparel, and how are you thinking about your overall private label assortment in terms of rebalancing and/or the portfolio relative to non-private label? Thank you very much.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nChristina, do you want to talk about some of the plans we have in place for the back half of the year, some of the newness we have in our assortment, and some of the exciting new changes we're going to make from an own brand standpoint?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nChief Growth Officer, Target\n\nYeah, I'd be happy to. So, Oliver, thanks for the question. On the discretionary portfolio, we continue to build our assortment strategy for the long term. We fully believe in our multi-category portfolio that it offers us an ability to meet the guest needs in a variety of different times.\nAt the moment, given where the consumer is spending, we're, of course, leaning on the strength of our food and beverage portfolio, essentials, and beauty, with beauty really being a highlight with double-digit growth, both in Ulta Beauty at Target as well as our core business. Within discretionary, what we're seeing is that there are things that are very much working around newness and innovation. As you pointed out, our own brand portfolio plays a huge role in delivering against those goals. We design, we create, we source, we build assortments where we can control a lot of those elements. We've introduced a lot of newness, whether you think about even in the last quarter, taking advantage of the hot trend with family tumblers and introducing that and embedding that in Hearth & Hand.\nWe have just relaunched our own brand Threshold, which is our signature home brand with updated aesthetics, great price points, and new branding. We continue to lean on opportunities. You'll see us launch a kitchenware brand later this quarter, which we're really excited about for its value but incredible quality and durability. Beyond those opportunities to introduce innovation, it's really taking advantage of the opportunities where guests can do more in one store at Target.\nThat happens during those seasonal times where we can leverage both the strength of food and beverage, as well as home or apparel, to complete the trip. Back-to-school, back-to-college, as Michael mentioned, is a terrific time for us to showcase the strength of our portfolio. We'll keep doing what we're doing. We're leaning into different categories, but we're planning appropriately so that we can be responsive in the market.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Target\n\nOliver, on traffic, as you know, we don't break out a separate traffic forecast, so kind of the build that goes into our top line guide is embedded in all the things that underlie it. A couple of thoughts that, one, I'll just reiterate from my comments, we were pleased with the sequential improvement in July in the quarter, and we saw traffic improve at a slightly faster rate than dollars did as we saw that improvement. Then if you zoom all the way back out versus 2019, if you look at the first six months of this year compared to 2019, I mean, we've got almost well over 20% higher traffic coming to our business than we were pre-pandemic. That translates to 170 million or so more guest interactions with Target in store and online.\nSo the deeper guest engagement we've built is evidenced by our traffic growth over time, critically important to our prospects going forward.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nOliver, to tie those two questions together, during the balance of the year, you'll continue to see us lean into seasonal moments. We know those are very important moments for our guests. Those are traffic-driving moments for Target. To Christina's point, we'll combine great newness with affordability throughout those seasons. If you're in our stores today or looking at Target.com, you're seeing us lean into this back-to-school season with great affordability. We'll continue to do that as we enter the Halloween season, get ready for the holidays, combining that great Target newness with great affordability to meet the needs of our guests.\nWe'll be cautious as we plan for the back half of the year, but we'll lean into those big seasonal moments where we know the guest expects Target to be there to meet their needs.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nRetail and Luxury Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nBrian, one follow-up. Inclusivity has always been important to Target, as well as thinking about stakeholders. What are your thoughts in terms of appealing to the broad array of customers going forward and strategies there, particularly around LGBTQIA+? Thanks a lot.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nOliver, at the heart of our purpose is our commitment to bring joy to all the families we serve. That really is all families. We want to make sure Target's that happy place for all of our guests, a place where they can recharge and enjoy those shopping experiences. You should expect to see us continue to do that over the years to come.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nRetail and Luxury Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nBest regards. Thanks a lot.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thanks so much for taking our question. The perception is that Target gained a lot of share over the last few years. Now, as its traffic is under pressure, guests are either going elsewhere or Target is losing market share. What levers can Target pull in order to recapture those who have become disenfranchised or are seeking out value or discretionary goods at other retailers, and how much might it cost to regain those guests that are now shopping elsewhere?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nMichael, I might start by zooming out a bit and kind of looking at our performance over several years. Since the start of the pandemic, we've added over $30 billion of top-line growth, a significant increase since 2019.\nImportantly, that's been driven by an increase in trips and transactions, guests spending more time shopping in our stores. I think the strategy we have in place and have had in place for years will serve us well going forward. We'll continue to make sure we're investing in a great in-store experience, making sure that we are recommitting to retail fundamentals, which means being in stock every time you shop, providing great affordability, making sure we're leveraging our proximity, providing a great guest experience.\nThat extends into the work we'll do from a fulfillment standpoint. We continue to see our guests turn to Target for same-day services, whether it's Drive-Up, or pickup, or having something delivered to their home through Shipt. Our own brand portfolio is now a $30 billion brand portfolio. It's a trusted portfolio of brands that provides great quality, style, and affordability.\nWe'll continue to invest in the strategy that served us so well over the last few years, and I believe we'll continue to serve us well going forward.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nUnderstood. Our follow-up question is on the operating expense outlook. In light of the traffic declines, presumably you're adjusting your labor, and on top of that, you're in the midst of harvesting $2 to 3 billion of savings over the next couple of years. Can you give us a sense for how your operating dollar growth is going to look in the back half of the year, and are there any one-time factors that are going to benefit your operating expense, excuse me, operating expense dollar growth that would not be sustainable moving forward?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nYeah, I'm happy to take that one, Michael. I mean, obviously, on the SG&A line, leverage matters.\nAnd so the softness we saw in the Q2 showed up in some deleverage on some of those more fixed expenses, especially in an inflationary environment. We've still got a fair amount of inflation. Importantly, investments in our team and wage and benefits on that line as well. I'll say the team's flexibility in the quarter, not just in SG&A, but across the P&L, was really remarkable. That starts with well-managed inventories. We talked about the implications for markdowns on the gross margin line there. Managing inventory well flows across the whole system. I mean, we were heavy last year. That makes us more efficient, more inefficient in stores when the back rooms are full. It makes us more inefficient in our distribution centers when we're managing a lot of inventory.\nWe're seeing the benefits of that cleaner inventory position across the system. I would expect those benefits to continue. We've got a team that's really focused on managing costs and expense well in the current environment. That work on efficiency, to translate the scale gains we've seen over the last few years into a more efficient operation, I would expect that to continue to be fuel in the quarters and years to come on the efficiency front.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Target\n\nOperator, we have time for one last question today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks, Brian, for the one more question. I wanted to ask, I don't know the way in which you look at the consumer, whether it's in quintiles or deciles.\nCan you give us a sense if you look at the comp that the business is performing, how that spreads across your best customer, your middle customer, and then maybe your most occasional customer? If there's anything we could glean from that and think about how it recovers.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nChristina, do you want to share some of the insights we have about the different guests that are shopping our stores today?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nChief Growth Officer, Target\n\nYeah. I think, obviously, as Brian talked about, we've seen a rotation in their wallet. The guests that are more engaged with our discretionary business are now leaning more into our frequency businesses. I would tell you, a very compelling proof point that came out of the Q2 is how we performed during Target Circle Week. Target Circle Week was Target's opportunity to demonstrate value and give back value to our most loyal customers.\nThis was a shift from prior years where we did Target deal days. The guests really responded to our actions. In fact, it was our single largest Target Circle Week ever. We acquired an incremental 500,000+ guests, which is more than 3.5x the average week's acquisition rate, into that loyalty program, a loyalty program, by the way, that already has 100 million members. The depth to which we're relating to our guests is going to continue to be fueled by our ability to understand them and serve them uniquely. Target Circle is one way that we're going to do that.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThen the follow-up, maybe for Michael, if you look at the margin recovery of the business that could happen over, call it, the next year or so, is there anything that stands in the way of it?\nMeaning, if we see comps recover and bounce back, especially that means your signature categories recover, is there any reason why we shouldn't see margins continue along that path? I know you said we'll answer it when we get back to the back half of the year, but is there anything that stands in the way of that margin recovery?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP, Target\n\nI think it's the factors we've been talking about for a while now, Simeon, and to see a return to positive comp growth in some of those higher margin discretionary categories, that'd be a welcome benefit to margin for sure. One of the things we'll need to continue to watch is the pressure we've seen from shrink. If you go back to where we were pre-pandemic, I mean, that is one of the single biggest margin headwinds in the business.\nThe path of stabilization, we were pleased to see shrink come in as we forecast it in Q2. That's still a material headwind on a year-over-year basis, on a two-year basis. I think that'll be an important variable to watch going forward as well.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChair and CEO, Target\n\nMichael, on that note, as we wrap up the call today, I certainly want to thank our entire team for their efforts throughout the quarter. I particularly want to recognize our asset protection teams. We've talked a lot over the last couple of quarters about the pressures we've been facing with organized retail crime. I really appreciate the work that our asset protection teams do each and every day to keep our guests safe, our team safe, and allow us to operate safely each and every day. Thank you all for joining us.\nWe look forward to talking to you later this year. That wraps up our Q2 call.\n\nOperator\n\nGoodbye.",

Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. Finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's press release and our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on Q1 and his priorities for Q2 and remainder of the year. Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, [John], and good morning, everyone. In Q1, our team's discipline and dedication to staying in step with our guests drove results that met or exceeded the expectations we set at our financial community meeting back in February. Q1 total sales increased 0.5%, reflecting flat comparable sales at the midpoint of our guidance range, combined with the benefit of sales in new locations. Profitability for the quarter was ahead of expectations.\nWe came into the year clear eyed about what consumers were facing with persistent inflation and rising interest rates. And we were determined to build on the trust our guests have had in Target by unifying as a team to deliver affordable joy each and every day as consumers and businesses navigate a third straight year of dynamic challenges. We knew this year would demand agility, teamwork, and the ability to flex across our multi-category portfolio as we emphasize the categories our guests need most now. Well, our team did all of that in Q1, taking another step forward on our long-term growth trajectory. I might point to three unbroken years of traffic growth as a proof point.\nIn Q1, comparable traffic grew 0.9% even as consumers were becoming more cautious in their overall shopping behavior. That's a healthy indication of the trust, loyalty, and strategic relevance we've created, especially given how much and how frequently consumers and the world circumstances have changed over those 12 straight quarters of traffic growth. Very few others can point to anything like that.\nThis growth in guest engagement is the product of deliberate investments we've been making for many years. In all we do, we put the guests at the center, listening carefully to them and finding innovative ways to make their lives easier, more convenient, and more joyful. Here again, both the balance of our multi-category portfolio and the flexibility of our stores-as-hub model are helping us stay in step with our guests.\nThe mix of in-store shopping has been growing for well over a year now as consumers have become increasingly comfortable in public places. This has led them to choose more in-store visits, causing in-store sales growth to outpace digital in Q1 both this year and a year ago. Notably, even within the digital channel, our same-day services, which rely entirely on our stores, expanded more than 5% during the quarter. As usual, this increase was led by our Drive Up service, which saw growth in the high single digits as more and more of our guests embraced the speed, convenience, and reliability it provides. In total for the quarter, more than 97% of our sales were fulfilled by our stores.\nAs it did throughout last year, pressure from inflation and rising interest rates affected the mix of retail spending in Q1, with a further softening in discretionary categories in the March and April timeframe. This coincided with the deterioration in consumer confidence, reflecting recent events such as the banking crisis that emerged in March.\nThese continued signs of caution among consumers have reinforced why we entered this year with a conservative inventory position. And as Michael will cover in more detail, we maintain that cautious stance throughout Q1 and feel good about our current positioning in light of the trends we've been seeing, but as Christina will highlight in a few minutes, our cautious posture has not reduced our commitment to offering fresh, on-trend merchandise throughout the year.\nWe know that newness is a critical element of what our guests expect when they shop with us. And even as they manage their household budgets and make disciplined buying choices, our guests continue to respond when we offer the right combination of newness, trend, right fashion, and affordability. That's what we mean when we talk about affordable joy. It's something that's core to our brand and a key differentiator in the marketplace.\nBeyond macroeconomic challenges, we continue to contend with significant headwinds caused by inventory shrink building on a worsening trend that emerged last year. While shrink can be driven by multiple factors, theft and organized retail crime are increasingly urgent issues impacting the team, our guests, and other retailers. The problem affects all of us, limiting product availability, creating a less-convenient shopping experience, and putting our team and guests in harm's way. The unfortunate fact is violent incidents are increasing at our stores and across the entire retail industry. When products are stolen, simply put, they're no longer available for our guests who depend on them. And left unchecked, theft and organized retail crime degrade the communities we call home.\nAs we work to address the problem, the safety of our guests and our team members will always be our primary concern. As a result, we are engaged in a variety of mitigation efforts which begin with significant resource investments to protect our team and our guests. In addition, we're installing fixtures to protect merchandise and adjusting our assortment in affected stores.\nBeyond safety concerns, worsening shrink rates are putting significant pressure on our financial results. More specifically, based on the results we've seen so far this year, we expect that shrink will reduce our profitability by more than half a billion dollars compared with last year. And while we're doing all we can to address the problem, it's an industry and community issue that can't be solved by a single retailer. That's why we're actively collaborating with legislators, law enforcement, and retail industry partners to advocate for public policy solutions to combat organized retail crime.\nAs we communicate with those partners, we emphasize that we're focused on keeping our stores open in the markets where problems are occurring. Our stores create jobs, serve local shoppers, and act as critical hubs in communities across the country. And we'll continue to do everything in our power to keep our doors open. At the same time, we'll be closely monitoring the safety of our team and guests as well as the financial impact to our business as we determine the right path forward at Target.\nEven as we navigate through multiple short-term challenges, we remain focused on making Target stronger and better for all our stakeholders over the long term. Right now, our team is rallying around a focus on retail fundamentals to ensure we're staying reliable and affordable for our guests and that we're translating key points of difference like our physical proximity to the vast majority of US shoppers and our emphasis on a joyful guest experience into unmatched ease and inspiration for our guests as we continue to grow and scale. We're also intently focused on creating easier and more efficient ways for our team to deliver on our strategy and fuel our ongoing growth ambitions.\nUnderpinning all of this is our continued commitment to disciplined return-based investments that will benefit stakeholders both today and well into the future. This goes well beyond our physical capital. As John will outline, we'll continue to make important investments in our team. This begins, of course, by building on the robust investments in wages and benefits we've made in recent years. Because of those past investments, today we offer a starting wage range of $15 to 24 across the country.\nWe've significantly enhanced the health and wellness benefits we provide. And tens of thousands of our team members are enrolled in our industry-leading debt-free college educational program, but our efforts extend well beyond the wages we pay and the benefits we offer. We are committed to building a culture of growth, providing our team with strong foundational learning, enhancing their skills, and preparing them to excel not just at their current role but their next role on the Target team as they continue to build a rewarding career with us.\nI want to close my remarks by thanking our team. Nothing is more energizing than the time I spend with them, from visits to our stores and distribution centers across the country to the time I recently spent with our headquarters team in Bangalore, India. Our team is proud to work at Target; and they show that pride through their actions every day, all in support of our guests. I'm proud to work alongside them, and it's a privilege to represent their efforts in venues like these. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. In many ways, the themes of the Q1 operating environment were very similar to what we've outlined in recent quarters, so it likely comes as no surprise that we continue to face elevated volatility and see a reprioritization of spending away from discretionary categories in the face of persistent inflation in groceries and essentials.\nDespite the near-term challenges facing the retail industry and our business, we remain confident in our ability to generate long-term results, largely driven by the unwavering commitment displayed by the Target team to our guests, each other, and the communities where we operate. Guests continue to place their trust in Target, choosing to shop with us more and more often at a time when consumers are hyper focused on managing their budgets.\nAs Brian mentioned, American consumers continue to face difficult trade-off decisions as they juggle the wants and needs of their families. Consumer saving rates are down, and while inflation rates are finally declining, so is consumer confidence. The fear of a looming recession weighs heavily on many American families, and though discretionary spending remains soft, our guests are still looking to sprinkle some affordable joy into their regular shopping at Target.\nIn Q1, comparable sales were flat to last year, which was squarely at the center of our expectations. As you heard from Brian, we continue to benefit from traffic and sales growth in our frequency categories, Food & Beverage, Household Essentials, and Beauty, which helped to offset softer year-on-year sales in our more discretionary home, apparel, and Hardlines categories. Within the quarter, total sales were strongest in February, began decelerating in March, and softened further near the end of April.\nQ1 performance was led by Beauty, which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens in light of continued strength in both core beauty and Ulta Beauty at Target assortment. Food & Beverage grew in the high single-digits, reflecting broad-based strength across the category. Household Essentials delivered low single-digit growth, reflecting notable strength in both the health and pet care categories.\nApparel, home, and Hardlines all experienced sales declines from the mid single digits to low double digits as guests continued to pull back on discretionary purchases. Notably, guests are shifting to shop more just in time in these categories as they wait until the last moments before key events to invest in new decor or wardrobe refreshes. As we've been noting for some time, despite overall softness in discretionary categories, seasonal moments and newness in apparel, home, and Hardlines continue to be bright spots prompting great responses from our guests.\nWithin Q1, we had strong Valentine's season and Easter holiday across multiple assortments ranging from food and hosting solutions to decor and giftables. New offerings in apparel, including the latest wave of our designer dress collection and new sets in women's athleisure, have seen incredible responses from guests. And this year's major theatrical releases such as Super Mario Bros. and the upcoming Disney film The Little Mermaid are driving outsized share gains and sales momentum. These examples demonstrate that when our assortments are fresh, seasonally relevant, and affordable, that's a winning formula to engage and delight our guests.\nGiven that consumers are cautious when buying discretionary items, we are being more declarative than ever about affordable joy and leaning into value messaging across all our media channels, in-store signing, merchandise displays, and through our digital platforms. With a balance of strong opening price points, timely and relevant promotions, as well as a mix of competitively priced national brands and high-quality and affordable own brand offerings, we have an opportunity to boldly demonstrate the power of Target's value proposition to our guests. As I've shared in prior calls, this is where the power of Roundel and Target Circle really shine through, creating collective value for our guests and for Target.\nWith consumers more price conscious and focused on promotions right now, we know they're willing to search for a deal but appreciate when we make the hunt easy for them. By utilizing our rich guest insights, we are best able to match the right product to the right guests with the right promotion. This is why we take such a differentiated approach with Roundel, thoughtfully and selectively connecting vendors and their products to our guests.\nRoundel's interconnection with the broader Target digital ecosystem means we are uniquely positioned to inspire the millions of users of our website, the Target app, and other diverse media platforms. This helps vendors find consumers that are most likely to be interested in their products, creates awareness and conversion to new products for our guests through compelling deals and ads, and drives top line and bottom line benefit to Target, all with an eye to enhancing the guest experience.\nSimilarly, we know this personalized touch is why active Target Circle users make 2.5x the trips in Q1 compared to non-Circle guests and spent 3x more. Whether through everyday offers or member-exclusive events like Target Circle Week in March, we see incredible guest response to Target Circle promotions. Roundel and Target Circle provide opportunities for us to connect with guests in both the short and long term, offering instantly gratifying promotions in the now and a tailored and elevated experience that builds lasting affinity tomorrow and beyond.\nAnd beyond promotions and product placements, we know that when guests try our own brand offerings, they love the value and quality they receive, and this leads to repeat purchases. We also know that simplified, easy-to-understand pricing promotion removes friction from the shopping experience both in stores and online. This explains why our guests are responding to affordable home decor selections, where we are expanding our assortment of items priced under $10. It's why we recently launched new swim assortments starting at just $12 and to help our guests get ready for summer celebrations of all kinds.\nOur only-at-Target Sun Squad brand offers everything needed to be outside this summer, with more than 60% of the entire assortment priced under $10 and nearly 90% of the assortment priced under $20, but our comprehensive view of affordability extends beyond compelling price points. In particular, our owned brand portfolio offers an unmatched combination of quality and price.\nFor an example, look no further than our $3 billion owned brand Cat & Jack, featuring on-trend, durable and affordable kids clothing. With everyday essentials like $4 T-shirts, $5 leggings, and $8 dresses and jeans, Cat & Jack offers both affordability and style. And because we stand behind not just the price but the quality of these items as well, we guarantee all Cat & Jack apparel for one full year, with free returns should anything not meet our guest expectations. This is just another example of how we offer comprehensive value for our guests, giving them affordable options without skimping on quality.\nAs we look to Q2 and beyond, we will continue the steady drumbeat of newness and value, all while maintaining a cautious inventory ownership position in our discretionary categories. In terms of seasonal moments and holidays, Target teams are focused on helping our guests celebrate all summer long. Starting last weekend, we kicked things off by celebrating Mother's Day with affordable and inspiring ways to thank the moms in our lives.\nWe have plans to continue celebrating key summer moments all quarter long, wrapping up with everything needed to host the perfect Fourth of July barbecue. With new summer food and beverage offerings, including more than 100 new Good & Gather items to Target-exclusive pickleball sets for amateurs and pros alike, we are listening closely to our guests and providing the hottest trends across our entire assortment.\nIn apparel, guests will find vibrant color palettes across our offerings, helping all families celebrate summer in style. Best of all, these apparel items provide amazing value with clear, compelling opening price points. For kids and kids at heart, the summer's roster of exciting movie blockbusters will find their way into multiple assortments ranging from apparel to toys to collectibles featuring familiar characters from Disney, Marvel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more.\nAnd because you can never have too much of a good thing, the latest assortment drop from Tabitha Brown just launched a few days ago. Already off to a fabulous start, this collection celebrates the joy that comes from gathering alongside friends and family, recharging in the summer sun and pausing for fun and games. The assortment includes over 60 items ranging from backyard entertaining essentials, games, tableware, outdoor furniture, as well as guest favorite food items back by popular demand.\nAs we navigate this challenging environment, we will continue to lean into flexibility and focus on retail fundamentals while remaining vigilant in monitoring changing trends with the consumer and the economy. It's only because of our incredible team that we are able to stay nimble, listening for and quickly applying guest feedback into our operations.\nTo our teams in stores, supply chain, and headquarters locations around the world, thank you for sharing your talents and passion in support of our guests. You are truly the best team in retail, and you bring Target's values to life each and every day. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Mulligan\n\nEVP and COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina. Through all of the rapid and unexpected changes we've experienced over the last three years, teams throughout our operations have done an amazing job maintaining their energy, staying agile, and doing everything in their power to serve our guests' ever-changing needs. Today, with two years of unusually rapid growth behind us and last year's excess inventory in the rearview mirror, we are focusing this year on training and development for our team, with an emphasis firmly centered on retail fundamentals.\nOur goal is to reinforce the reliability and consistency of our shopping experience as we help our team members to succeed in their current job and build the right skills to prepare for the next one. More specifically, every store this year is engaging in assessments to reinforce consistently strong execution throughout the country and every day of the year. These assessments are centered on the factors most essential to operating great stores and delivering a consistent experience, ranging from staffing and scheduling to inventory management, in-store signing, digital fulfillment, guest and team member safety, and the checkout experience.\nIn support of these efforts, we're investing in training and development across every level of our team, from entry-level team members to the store leaders. Beyond the reinforcement of everyday best practices, we're preparing our team to support new services, including the upcoming rollout of Drive Up returns and the opening of additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations. In addition, to develop our store supervisors and leaders, we're investing in a cohort-based peer learning model in which participants engage in classroom experiences, one-on-one coaching, and on-the-job practice. All of this training is designed to help our teams succeed today and build our pipeline of future leaders.\nOf course, a foundational element of our team development effort is our education assistance program called Dream to Be, which enables our US-based part-time and full-time team members to pursue tuition-free undergraduate and associate degrees, certificates, and boot camps. This industry-leading program features tuition-free options in more than 250 business-aligned programs across more than 40 schools, colleges, and universities. Since the rollout of Dream to Be in 2021, tens of thousands of our team members have successfully participated in this program.\nAs you saw in today's release, we ended Q1 with 16% less inventory than a year ago. This decrease reflects our current cautious position in discretionary categories, combined with the impact of excess inventory on last year's balance sheet. Those factors are being partially offset by some purposeful inventory investments. These include investments in support of our frequency categories in light of the rapid growth we've been seeing and to ensure we're in stock.\nAnd I'm happy to say that these investments have been paying off. In Q1, out-of-stocks of our most important food and beverage and essentials items were running at three-year lows and trending in a favorable direction. In addition to support of our frequency businesses, we're also making strategic inventory investments where we believe we have a long-term market share opportunity, most notably in the upcoming back-to-school and back-to-college seasons.\nAs you know, in our supply chain, we're engaged in a multi-year journey to modernize how we replenish inventory in our stores. When I moved into this position eight years ago, store inventory replenishment was a standardized, inflexible process that placed a heavy burden on our store team members. With this modernization effort, a primary goal is to reduce those labor demands on our stores. We achieve that result by moving work upstream to a distribution center where we can apply the appropriate processes, technology, tools, and automation to accomplish the work at scale. This results in higher labor efficiency for the company overall while allowing our store team members to spend more time in the front of our stores with our guests.\nIn the upstream distribution centers we've opened over the last two years, we've implemented technology and capabilities that improve how product is sorted and loaded onto trailers headed for our stores. These improvements reduce the necessary time for the store team to unload the trailer and for them to move the inventory to where it's needed in the store.\nIn these new buildings, we've also invested to automate the sortation and packing of break pack items, facilitating the shipment of quantities smaller than a full case pack. This automated process makes the shipment easier to unload, reduces sorting time for the store team, and lowers the amount of inventory in our store backrooms. Outside of our new facilities, we're working to roll out similar capabilities to our legacy distribution centers.\nIn addition, throughout our legacy network, we continue to focus on reducing the overall cost of store replenishment by implementing automation along with other improvements. For example, we've been testing ways to improve the lead time and accuracy of our deliveries from several of our existing buildings and have seen an increase in speed and lower out-of-stocks in stores serviced from these facilities, but I want to stress automation is only one way to deliver value to our business.\nConsider our sortation centers, which are positioned downstream from our stores to provide speed and efficiency in support of last-mile delivery. Our sort centers are not highly automated. Instead, they use technology and sophisticated process logic to sort packages and provide a faster and better guest experience at a significantly lower cost. In fact, it's because of the relative simplicity in the design of these buildings and the efforts of an incredibly innovative and energetic team that we've been able to scale the number of these buildings so quickly from three a year ago to nine today and an expected total of 15 or more in 2026.\nBeyond rapidly scaling the number of sort centers, our team continues to innovate around the existing processes in those buildings, finding ways to deliver additional value to the business. One example is a new facility that we opened earlier this month in Smyrna, Georgia. This new facility, which cost very little to open, serves as an extension of the existing sortation center in the Atlanta market, extending the reach of our next-day delivery capability.\nWith this new facility, online orders that have been packed by Atlanta area stores continue to flow to the sortation center, where they're sorted and delivered via our national carrier partners or a Shipt driver. However, a portion of local orders falling outside the sortation center's last-mile delivery area can now be transferred to the Smyrna extension, where Shipt drivers can pick them up and serve additional neighborhoods. With the opening of this extension facility, our next-day delivery capability is now reaching more than 3 million guests in the Atlanta market.\nAs we mentioned at our recent financial community meeting, in our Dallas and Minneapolis sortation centers, Target and Shipt have been testing the development of high-capacity van routes that enable us to bring last-mile delivery to a larger number of guests. In addition, over the past year, across all of our markets served by our sortation centers, we have shifted more routes to larger passenger vehicles, and early results have been positive.\nCompared with routes previously served by sedans, SUVs, and minivans can deliver more than double the number of packages per route, while high-capacity vans can service nearly 5x as many packages. And beyond capacity, the use of larger vehicles enables further route optimization, increasing the number of packages that can be delivered per hour. With these changes, in Q1, approximately 65% of our last-mile deliveries serviced by Shipt were made with larger vehicles compared with zero a year ago. This resulted in meaningful cost savings for our last-mile delivery program overall.\nBased on the success of these efforts, we're developing plans to begin testing high capacity vans at a larger scale. In addition, we're developing a standardized, faster way to load those vans, enabling package containerization and easy identification of the correct packages at delivery. In addition to simplifying the load process for the drivers, this new process will enable us to safely move a larger number of Shipt drivers in and out of our sort centers in a given amount of time, expanding our last-mile delivery capacity in these markets.\nWhile there are many different ways our team is working to gain efficiencies and deliver value to the business, all of our projects have some things in common. First and foremost, they're all designed and implemented with a focus on our guests and continuing to build their engagement with Target. In keeping with that guest focus, we design processes and deploy technology and automation as a way to highlight the human element in our business rather than minimizing it. It's an essential element of our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.\nAs I get ready to close, I want to pause and thank our team for bringing that purpose to life every day for both our guests and for your fellow team members. You're the reason that guests trust and love our brand and why they choose to shop at Target. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. In many ways, the environment today feels completely different than three years ago, when the pandemic was just beginning and no one knew what to expect, but today, even as the pandemic feels further and further behind us, we continue to face elevated macro uncertainty and volatility as the world continues the transition toward a new normal.\nFrom a macro perspective, inflation remains high and stubbornly persistent, having recently peaked at decades-high levels. To control this inflation, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates at an unprecedented pace, but for now, despite the building economic pressure from both inflation and higher interest rates, the US unemployment rate is lower today than it's been in 50 years. As Christina mentioned, consumer spending patterns continue to evolve, putting significant pressure on our discretionary categories.\nWhile I'm guessing we're all looking forward to the day when economic conditions begin to stabilize and normalize, I'm pleased that today, even in the face of all these challenges, we're continuing to see deeper engagement from our guests. That's most visible in our traffic, which grew just under 1% in Q1 and has now grown for 12 consecutive quarters. In fact, since 2019, prior to the pandemic, Q1 total sales have increased more than 43%. The vast majority of that growth is the result of an increase in sales per square foot over that time, of which a significant portion has been driven by traffic.\nTotal sales grew 0.5% in Q1, reflecting flat comparable sales combined with the contribution from new locations. Total revenue growth of 0.6% reflected sales growth, combined with double-digit growth on the other revenue line, led by our Roundel ad business.\nAs Brian mentioned, sales trends softened over the course of Q1. More specifically, we began the quarter with positive comp growth in the month of February and then saw the trend soften into low single-digit declines by the end of April and so far into May.\nOur Q1 gross margin rate of 26.3% was about 60 basis points higher than a year ago. Among the drivers, we saw more than a percentage point of favorability in merchandising, driven primarily by a reduction in freight and transportation costs, along with the benefit of retail pricing and a lower clearance markdown rate, as we compared over last year's inventory actions. We also saw a small gross margin rate benefit from lower digital volume and a more favorable mix of lower-cost same-day fulfillment.\nOffsetting those two sources of benefit, shrink reduced our gross margin rate by a full percentage point compared with a year ago. As Brian highlighted, pressure from shrink has continued to increase. And we now expect that if current trends continue, shrink will reduce our full year profitability by more than $500 million compared with last year. One note: the impact of merchandise mix on our Q1 gross margin rates was approximately neutral, as the rate impact of sales declines in our highest-margin categories was offset by sales declines in lower-margin-rate categories.\nConsistent with the guidance we provided for the quarter, our Q1 SG&A expense rate was 19.8%, up about 90 basis points from a year ago. This increase reflects our continued purposeful investments in pay and benefits for our team, combined with inflationary cost pressures throughout our business against a backdrop of flat comparable sales, partially offset by the benefit of productivity increases and strong expense discipline across the company.\nOur Q1 D&A expense rate was down about 10 basis points, reflecting lower accelerated depreciation related to our remodel program compared with last year. Altogether, our Q1 operating income rate of 5.2% was higher than expected due primarily to upside in our gross margin rate, as the benefits from lower freight and transportation costs and our efficiency efforts offset a higher-than-expected impact from shrink.\nAs John mentioned, Q1 ending inventory was about 16% lower than a year ago. Within that inventory number was a decline of more than 25% in discretionary categories, reflecting the excess inventory we were carrying last year and the cautious approach we are taking this year. Partially offsetting the decline in discretionary inventory are the purposeful inventory investments we're making in our frequency categories along with some strategic bets in support of long-term share opportunities. We believe our cautious inventory approach has served us well so far this year and will continue to be the right approach going forward.\nAs I turn now to capital deployment, I'll start where I always do by reiterating our long-standing priorities. First, we fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and look to build on our record of annual increases which we've maintained since 1971. And third, only after we've supported those first two priorities, we deploy any excess cash to repurchase shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\nRegarding the first priority, we made capital investments of $1.6 billion in Q1 as we continue to remodel stores, open up new locations, build upstream inventory replenishment capacity, and ramp up our sortation center strategy. With 1/4 of the year behind us, we continue to expect our full year CapEx will be in the $4 to 5 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $497 million in Q1, up from $424 million last year, driven by a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in average share count.\nAnd finally, given the impact of the current environment on our financial performance, we didn't repurchase any shares in Q1. In the near term, we'll maintain that approach and don't intend to resume repurchase activity until it's compatible with our long-term credit rating goals.\nOn that note, I'm pleased with our progress in strengthening our balance sheet. Even as profitability remains well below our long-term potential, we've already seen an encouraging improvement in our operating cash flows. More specifically, our operations generated $1.3 billion of cash in Q1, in stark comparison to a year ago when our operations absorbed $1.4 billion. This dramatic year-over-year improvement was driven almost entirely by changes in our inventory investment compared with last year.\nAnd finally, I want to end my review of the quarter with our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months through Q1 of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 11.4% compared with 25.3% a year ago, reflecting both the change in profitability and the increase in working capital we began to see a year ago. As we move further into the year, we expect to see higher profitability than a year ago and continue to benefit from the inventory efficiency reflected in this quarter's cash flow. Based on these expectations, we anticipate a recovery in the ROIC metric this year and expect to continue building back toward our longer-term potential in 2024 and beyond.\nSo now let me turn to our expectations for Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, on the sales line, we experienced notably softer comp trends as we exited Q1 and moved into May. As a result, we're anticipating Q2 sales in a wide range centered around a low single-digit decline consistent with those recent trends.\nIn terms of profitability, we're expecting a range of possibilities as well. On the gross margin line, we believe that many of the same trends that emerged in Q1 will continue in Q2, including a meaningful tailwind from freight and transportation costs and a significant headwind resulting from inventory shrink. Similarly, on the SG&A expense line, we'll continue to face broad-based inflationary pressures and expect to benefit from efficiency efforts and cost discipline across our team. However, if our Q2 comp sales end up declining in the low single digits, which is where they are trending currently, we'll see greater SG&A rate pressure related to cost deleverage than we experienced in Q1.\nIn light of all of these expectations, we believe our Q2 operating margin rate will be much higher than the very low rate we earned a year ago but lower than the 5.2% we saw in Q1. Altogether, our expectations translate to a Q2 GAAP and adjusted EPS range of $1.30 to 1.70.\nAs we look beyond Q2, we continue to believe that we entered this year with the appropriate level of caution, planning conservatively in light of a tough macro environment and rapidly changing consumer trends. While we're facing some clear headwinds in the short term, we also have multiple actions underway to mitigate them, including ongoing efficiency work and cost-saving efforts that we expect to flow into the P&L in the second half of the year. While we feel good about these efforts, we also remain cautious on the overall environment in light of the macro and shrink pressures we've outlined today.\nTaking this all into account, we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided at our financial community meeting in February. Namely, we're planning for full year comparable sales in a wide range centered around flat. We expect to grow our full year operating income by $1 billion or more, and we expect our business to generate full year GAAP and adjusted EPS of $7.75 to 8.75.\nAs I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to reiterate my confidence in our longer-term prospects for profitable growth. Even today, against a very challenging backdrop, we're starting to assemble the building blocks for a recovery in our operating margin rate back toward its longer-term potential. And while spending pressures and discretionary categories are currently outweighing the continued strong growth we've seen in our frequency categories, we're confident that the economy and the consumer will stabilize over time and will once again benefit from growth in the more discretionary portion of our assortment.\nIn the meantime, we have the capacity to navigate this environment with a strong balance sheet and a resilient business model. We have the right long-term strategy and we're privileged to work with the best team in retail. I want to express my sincere thanks to our entire team. You are by far our most valuable long-term asset. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAs Michael just mentioned, we don't build our strategy based on a single moment but focus on the best way to serve our guests over time. We take that approach when we invest in our stores, in our supply chain, in digital fulfillment, and our team. As we've said many times, we also build our assortment to serve the long-term needs of our guests. And the benefit of this flexible assortment strategy has been clearly evident over the last few years.\nFollowing the onset of the pandemic, we saw unprecedented traffic and sales growth in our discretionary categories. And now this year, even as guests are pulling back on discretionary purchases, we still grew traffic just under 1% in Q1 as guests increased their spending in Beauty, Food & Beverage, and Household Essentials, but a short-term pullback in discretionary purchases doesn't mean we'll turn away from our apparel, home, and hardline categories. Instead, we'll continue to invest in them and deliver fresh new items throughout the year. That's because our guests continue to love these categories and we're focused on building our guest engagement with them.\nThink about it this way. When I arrived at Target just under nine years ago, our Food & Beverage category was underperforming and losing market share, but rather than turning away from that part of our business, we decided to lean in. We committed to the long term and engaged in the hard work that we needed to improve our performance, ranging from our relationship with vendors to our fresh food supply chain, store labor model, assortment strategy, and our owned brands.\nMuch of that work happened behind the scenes. And it took time before business trends in Food & Beverage started to change, but the work paid off over time. We entered 2023 following three straight years of unprecedented growth and market share gains in Food & Beverage, having grown that category by more than 61% between Q1 2019 and this year's Q1.\nBeauty is another category where past investments are paying off. It's been performing well for years because we continually invested in the store experience; in passionate, talented, and well-trained team members; in our digital experience; and our assortment. Our growing partnership with Ulta Beauty is the latest example of how we're finding innovative ways to further enhance our Beauty assortment and experience. And our business results clearly demonstrate that our investments are paying off. We've experienced double-digit growth in Beauty sales for the last three years in a row and just saw mid-teen growth in Q1.\nThese examples demonstrate why we're investing and maintaining a long-term focus across the board on every one of our merchandising categories, fulfillment options, stores, services, and our team, all in service to bringing affordable joy to our guests. If we do that right, we'll always be ready to serve our guests as their needs change, further deepening our long-term relationship with them. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael, and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. To withdraw your request, press star two. Our first question comes from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\n\nEd Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to start with the guidance. I mean clearly you're beginning to see increased consumer pressure now in Q2. And I think those signs of weakening are broad out there, but the midpoint of your guidance implies a pretty good back half improvement. I'm just kind of curious how you thought about Q2 with the reaffirmation of the full year. Is it realistic for us to think that the back half would be in the low $2 range given what Q2 guidance is? Thank you.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI'll let Michael start by talking about Q2 and then I'll talk about our focus on the balance of the year.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, and thanks for the question. You said part of the answer right in your question. We continue to take a cautious approach to the top line. We think that served us really well in Q1. It's one of the reasons we got the profit outcome we did in Q1 is that, with inventory positioned conservatively, that gives us flexibility and agility. And so you'll continue to see us take that posture for the balance of the year. And that comes with an impact on the top line and the bottom line. Our leverage looks different at a slightly negative comp than it does when we're running a positive comp.\nA couple of other things that I dimensionalize kind of in how they'll paginate over the year, though. One is shrink, with the current trends continuing. That year-over-year pressure from shrink is certainly front half loaded in the year, and so you see that impact in Q2 as well. And then we're excited about the continued work on our efficiency initiatives. And you'll see some of that come to bear in the back half of the year too. So taking that all together, we feel good about the full year positioning and we're appropriately cautious for Q2.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nYou heard Christina talk about the changes we've taken from an inventory standpoint and the benefits that's going to provide over the balance of the year. That gives us optimism as we think about the full year guidance. The combination of reduced inventory allows us to bring newness into our assortment, make sure we're on trend with the items we know our guests are shopping for, continue to leverage the traffic gains we've seen now for 12 consecutive quarters, and balance the strength we're seeing in Food & Beverage, Household Essentials, and Beauty with the seasonal moments where Target shines.\nSo as we sit here today, we're excited about back to school and back to college. We've got great plans for the holiday season. And Christina and her team have done a fabulous job of making sure we've got new on-trend items that are going to delight our guests and provide that affordable joy we're looking for each and every day.\n\nEd Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nJust a follow-up. At the investor day, you mentioned that 6% is, I guess, potential for 2024. And the backdrop is shifting, though. Can you just sort of update us on your thoughts around that building blocks considering the macro? Thank you.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, nothing new to share on that front today. I mean, as we sit here one quarter into the year with a comp that played out kind of exactly as we expected and a full year guidance that we think is still appropriate, I think we're the underlying work in front of us to build back profitability, a meaningful piece of which is part of our plan here in 2023, will be the first step along that path.\n\nEd Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning everybody. A follow-up to the first question there. On the comp side, is it your expectation that despite disinflation in consumables, that clean inventory, some new newness, and easier compares, you're expecting general merchandise performance to, I guess, maybe get less worse as we get into the back half of the year?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nHi, Chris. Maybe I can start this one. We acknowledge that there's a lot of volatility and that we cannot predict the future, but our expectation is that some of the strengths of Target really amplify during the back half of the year. And it starts with what Brian said, back to school, back to college, where the full value proposition of Target is really put on display. You can leverage all five categories in our multi-category portfolio to achieve what you need for your family, buying backpacks, lunches, and new outfits for school. And that really then sets up into a cadence of the fall with we start new fashion trends in September. We go into October with Halloween, followed by Thanksgiving and Christmas. And those are big moments for Target.\nOn top of that, we do believe that there's some market share upside in key categories, especially in home, where we believe back to college will benefit strongly from market disruptions in categories like domestics and kitchen appliances, so we're betting on some of those things as well as the newness and the agility that both Michael and Brian have spoken to, that having the right fresh assortment and continuing to lead into the affordable side of that will give us momentum in the back half.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nChris, the only thing I might add to that is that's all underpinned by a clean inventory position. I mean one of the benefits of planning inventory cautiously is we've got the flexibility to lean into all the good stuff Christina just talked about. And so the end to the quarter down 16% on a year-over-year basis, that over 25% in the discretionary categories, gives us a lot of room to maneuver as we get into the back part of the year.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Then as a follow-up, just thinking about the puts and takes as you move through in the back half of the year on the margin, particularly on the gross margin front. So it sounds like the shrink headwind sort of dissipates as you, hopefully, catch up on an accrual here. Does freight also improve? And then as you think about the benefit of freight rise into the back half. And then as you think about the efficiency efforts, can you talk about how they're proceeding and where you expect those efficiency efforts to play out in the P&L?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah, you're hitting on some of the three key big factors, as we get into the back part of the year. We're pleased to see headwinds on a year-over-year basis from freight. We're in a better place now than we were a year ago certainly on that front. That will continue as we get into the back part of the year, based on how we currently have things projected.\nOn the efficiency side of things, I mean there's a lot within that. Some of that will come to bear this year, as we've shared before, importantly. Some of that will come to bear over the next few years, but as an example of something that we'll see more benefit from in the back half of this year, sortation centers are a perfect example.\nWe've got many more facilities opened this year. They'll do a lot of business in the back half of the year. And so that's more sort centers helping deliver goods faster in a sort center market and to save us some last-mile shipping costs with our Shipt drivers delivering those brown boxes. And so that's one of many initiatives that will start to bear fruit as we get into the back part of this year and in the years to come.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst for US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So one of the key debates right now on Target is what's a sustainable gross margin rate moving forward. And the Q1 performance is going to help inform the various perspectives on that, so with that being said, can you help bridge the gap in your Q1 2023 gross margin performance versus 2019? I know you said that 100 basis points of the gross margin decline versus last year was shrink. I think you previously said that, heading back to last year, there was a 150 basis points drag, so is it right to think that more than 2/3 of the decline from this quarter to 2019 was just shrink related?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nSo I'll take a swing at that, Michael. As I said in my remarks, the big drivers, speaking on a year-over-year basis, of margin in Q1, we had tailwind from freight. We already talked a little bit about the benefit we're seeing there on a year-over-year basis. Versus 2019, freight is still a headwind, to be clear, but on a year-over-year basis we're seeing some benefit.\nWe also saw some benefit on a year-over-year basis on the markdown and, I think, salvage front as we recover from some of the inventory actions that we started to take last year. We saw the headwind from shrink, a full percentage point in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. Like I said, if the current trends were to continue, we'd see that drag from shrink be front half of the year loaded in kind of how it shows up throughout the year, but you're hitting on the key, three key drivers on a year-over-year basis.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst for US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nOkay. My follow-up question is the other area of discussion is going to be how do you hit this flattish comp for the full year in light of what's perceived to be a deteriorating macro situation, so perhaps you're going to make some purposeful choices trading off some margin in order to drive traffic. If that's the case, how much are you willing to sacrifice the profitability in order to maintain the top line performance as we move into the second half of the year and beyond? Thank you so much.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nI'm happy to start. Christina, feel free to chime in. We think about it a little differently than that, Michael, in that as we think about the last back half of the year, I mean, we're going to drive traffic in a lot of ways, but it's not a simple trade-margin-for-traffic play. It's about being relevant for our guests in the moments that matter. And as evidenced by the strength in traffic we saw in Q1, with the balance we have across categories, we can appeal to whatever is at the top of the guest's shopping list. First and foremost, that's how we think about staying relevant and driving traffic.\nOur guide for the year, unchanged at the end of Q1 versus what we said 90 days ago, incorporates our best view of how we see all of those puts and takes playing out. It's a wide range on the top line and the bottom line, but we believe it's appropriate from the variables as we digest them sitting one quarter into the year. Christina, feel free to. Is there anything you'd add?\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I agree with Michael 100%, that we aren't looking to make those two trade-offs. What we do instead is we look at where's the potential for us to take share because our unique proposition in the market might play really well under these circumstances, but in the discretionary categories, we're going in with a very conservative posture.\nIt's the strength of our multi-category portfolio and the guests choosing food and beverage, household essentials, and beauty. That's creating the majority of the traffic gains that we're seeing right now. I'm very confident about what that means in terms of what the guest is saying. In the categories where there's the most price inflation and the most price sensitivity, they're choosing us disproportionately often, which I think is a very good sign of the relevance that we created.\nNow we will lean into newness. We will lean into affordable joy. We will Lean into areas where the guests also are telling us that they're finding our value proposition to be relevant. That showed up in Q1 in key seasonal moments and is why I'm excited about the back half, because we have more of them. And there's more disruption in key categories like home.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, the only other thing I would add is, as we think about leveraging our multi-category portfolio in this environment, we have the advantage of a nice balance between national brands and the continued strength we see in own brands, particularly at a time when our guests are looking for that affordable joy from Target. We do think we're uniquely positioned to continue to maneuver through a challenging 2023 through the strength of our multi-category portfolio, the great national brand partnerships we have, complemented by our own brands, and the flexibility we built into our system by reducing inventory and giving us the ability to flow fresh new items that are trend right for our guests.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst for US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and have a great day.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Karen Short with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\n\nKaren Short\n\nEquity Research Managing Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask a little bit about your you had a lot of discussion in terms of price points that are going to be lower in discretionary. I guess my question is how much of your weakness in discretionary is just a misperception on your actual price point and your value proposition. That's my first question. Then my second question is when you obviously have more of an extreme issue on shrink than some other retailers. How much are you losing sales based on some of the measures that you're taking?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nKaren, why don't I start and address the last point? Because as we sit here today, we think about what's happening from a theft and organized retail crime standpoint. It's an urgent issue not just for Target but across the entire retail industry. It is a problem that impacts availability of product. The shopping conditions are less convenient. And unfortunately, what I'm most concerned with is it puts our team and our guests in harm's way.\nWe are working right now with NRF, our partners at RILA, other retailers across the country to make sure that we can talk to legislators, that we can work with law enforcement to make some industry-wide changes. And we're advocating for public policy changes to address the growing issues that surround all of us in retail today with theft and organized retail crime.\nChristina, if we talk about our approach to discretionary categories. I think we've been very clear about the fact that we've been trying to bring fresh new items and at a great price point and value that our guests are looking for. Karen, I think that's been really consistent throughout the last couple of years, as we've seen an overall decline in apparel sales in the industry, in home and hardline related categories, but Christina can talk to the fact, in many cases, we're holding or growing share in categories that have been soft but where we continue to see strength in our ability to hold share and bring newness that's relevant to the guest.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, that's absolutely right. We have been talking about unit share for many, many, many quarters in a row because in many cases we didn't actually raise our prices as much as the market. And we maintained that affordability. And so that has continued to help contribute the traffic gains that we've seen and the performance that we've seen in aggregate.\nOur value proposition is always a balance between expect more and pay less, and we're always going to play up that end. The opportunity for us is to make sure that we are cutting through, with the clarity of our promotions, that we continue to put those great items in front of the guests in our merchandise displays and that our website reflects the incredible value that we do offer.\nI would tell you, though, that something that we're leaning into that has the potential to continue to create relevance for our guests is Target Circle. Target Circle is our loyalty program. It's free, and it offers personalized promotions. And it is we've seen that that is generating better returns than mass promotions. Our ability to not only create relevance for our guests but deliver better returns for the business is a big priority for us. That is part of the ecosystem the way we deliver value.\nThe last part that I'd offer up, though, is because the way we deliver value and our value proposition is about balance, it comes through a lot in the assortment. And owned brands play a particular role here. Not only are they great-quality products that have been designed with specific guests needs in mind. They're also incredibly accessible from a price point perspective. That's why you hear us talking a lot about that, particularly in this environment.\n\nKaren Short\n\nEquity Research Managing Director, Credit Suisse\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking my question. I just want to get your perspective in terms of what you're seeing right now in the promotional backdrop. And then for Q2, just curious if you guys have assumed a more promotional backdrop, in Q2.\n\nChristina Hennington\n\nEVP and Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nRight now there's no question that guests are seeking deals. The opportunity to balance their budget by finding deals is very visible. As I just talked about, the way that we're continuing to evolve our proposition is make sure that the deals that we do offer are certainly competitive with the market but that they're increasingly more personalized. And has been said a couple times now, the inventory position that we're in right now gives us the ability to compete with the market but not chase the market down. That's what we're really excited about. We have an agile playbook that will allow us to continue to go after creating relevance for our guests and offering value but keep it rational.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. And then my follow-up question, just on the shrink. I think, per our estimates, I think shrink is now a billion-dollar-plus headwind over a two-year basis. Does your team feel that you can fully recover that headwind over time? And then with some of the efforts that you already have in place, are you starting to see traction with any of those efforts, even if they're maybe in the early stages?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nJohn, why don't you talk about some of the mitigation efforts we've put in place?\n\nJohn Mulligan\n\nEVP and COO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. I think, as we think about mitigation efforts, I would go back to, first, what Brian said. It starts first and foremost with creating a safe environment for our team and for our guests. There are multiple approaches to that but also have a financial impact. Clearly, there is what we do with merchandise and how we display it and how we make that available to a guest. There is assortment changes that we can make to improve that performance as well. Finally, there's security changes in the store that we can make. You put all three of those together,\nAs you said, we introduced some of those last year, and over time, we do see the impact of that. We see improvement in the safeness of the store. We see improvement in sales, and we see a reduction in out-of-stocks, all of which to us are positive indicators that we can make progress. And we'll continue to implement those. Now some of those create additional friction for our guests. It's on us to create the right environment with our team so that we reduce that friction as much as possible, but we do see. Overall, again through time, we see those things improve.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nSenior Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Brian, it's been said a few times the consumer is becoming more cautious. Can you talk about the competitive backdrop? I think it's natural that it's gotten more competitive. It sounded like that in Christina's remarks. Can you maybe give perspective on how it compares maybe to last year or even pre COVID?\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nI think we've seen pretty consistent trends year-on-year. One of the things as we think about discretionary categories, Simeon, and we talked about this in February, at our financial community meeting: While we have seen some softness, last year, we generated almost $55 billion of revenue in those discretionary categories. If we go back to pre pandemic, we've seen sizable gains across all three of our major discretionary categories: apparel, home, and Hardlines.\nThere is still a consumer who's shopping those categories. There is certainly a competitive activity that we're watching carefully, but to Christina's point, we're trying to make sure that we're not leading the market down. We're using the benefits of Target Circle, the personalized offers to those guests that we know are looking for those items at Target, and blending the balance of our national brands with our owned brands to provide great value each and every day.\nSo those categories are still relevant to the consumer. As Christina mentioned, we see certainly dislocation in the retail market. That's going to open up market share opportunities for us. I think we're going to start realizing some of that during the back-to-college season, but we will also see opportunities over the balance of the year and as we go into the holiday season to continue to make sure guests are turning to Target for those discretionary purchases they're looking to make.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nSenior Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Brian. And then a quick follow-up maybe from Michael. The negative flow-through in Q2 looks like it's higher than that of Q1. And there is some movement in math given the comparisons here. Curious why shouldn't there be more margin recovery in Q2 even on the negative comp or potentially negative comp.\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah, I think I've hit most of the key themes there already. Just to repeat a couple: We're positioned in the top line conservatively, and that means what leverage looks like in an inflationary cost environment throughout the P&L looks different planning for a slightly negative comp in our guide for Q2, so you see some deleverage there. And then we've talked a few times the headwind of shrink will be present again in Q2, and that's more of a front-half-of-the-year thing than a back-half-of-the-year thing. Those would be some of the key things that we'll watch as the quarter plays out.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nOperator, we have time for one final question today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nSenior Equity Analyst for US Hardlines and Broadlines Retail, Bernstein\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe to just follow up on the gross margin question first. You mentioned that, relative to 2019, rate is a headwind. Shrink is a headwind, et cetera. When we talked back in the Q4 event, we asked about the notion of permanent sort of impairment to gross margins. We're looking at gross margin historically in Q2 gross margin above 30%. Can you give us some idea of where you might expect gross margins to come in for Q2, what might you consider middle slice and maybe ambitious for gross margin for Q2?\n\nMichael Fiddelke\n\nEVP and CFO, Target Corporation\n\nYeah. Our expectations for both margin and SG&A and the rest of those are all baked into that EPS guide. As you guys know, we don't break out the specific components in our guidance. And the other thing I'd note, you probably heard me say this before, quarterly margins have more noise in them than, I think, sometimes the group here might appreciate. Add so stepping back and seeing the margin trajectory over a longer period of time, I think, is going to be important. We've got some work to do on that front that's baked into our guide for the year to recover some of the margin pressure that we saw last year.\n\nBrian Cornell\n\nChairman and CEO, Target Corporation\n\nAll right. So that concludes our Q1 call. We appreciate all of you joining us and look forward to talking to you later this year. So thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nGoodbye.",

I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting remotely. And of course, we're happy that so many of you have joined us here in person today.\nBefore I turn it over to Brian to start the meeting, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian to begin the meeting.\n(presentation)\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, good morning, and thank you for joining us. Looking forward to spending this time with you. We're eager to share our plans, including how we'll continue to grow, how we'll continue to rebuild profitability on that growth and how we'll strengthen our business in conditions that have changed a lot since we gathered here at the Times Center last year.\nAt that time, we just passed a crucial milestone. We had just become a $106 billion company. For the full year 2022, which we're reporting today, we placed another $3.1 billion of revenue growth on top of that growth. We grew traffic by 2.1%. We gained unit share across our core merchandising categories, which means that consumers who were constrained by inflation and have to be very selective about where they shop and what they buy, continue shopping and buying at Target. And despite difficulties throughout the year, we closed the books on 2022 with our 23rd straight quarter of comp sales growth. However, the path between last year's Times Center meeting and this one was anything but predictable.\nWhen we last gathered here, New York was still under a mask mandate. And though -- although consumers had started moving towards postpandemic behaviors, with families returning to travel and restaurants and shifting some dollars at a retail, we are just beginning to see how volatile and uncertain 2022 would become as spiraling inflation forced families to put discretionary purchases on hold and focus most of their spending on necessities. And there was a rapid escalation to the most expensive operating environment we've seen in decades, all of which was made worse by the spike in fuel prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine. Those variables and many others continue to have a profound effect on the retail landscape.\nSo this morning, we want to take stock of that situation. We want to speak clearly of how Target is planning to stay on our growth path for the years ahead. We're keeping this morning's agenda very focused on our strategy, operations, growth investments and financial expectations. We see this as a time to combine steady leadership with our long-term strategy and a continued focus on agility and strong focus on retail fundamentals. Our goals this morning are to show you how we're navigating near-term challenges. How the durability of our business model lies in its flexibility. We'll share what we're prioritizing to stay in step with our guests, and how we'll flex across our multi-category portfolio, which means, in the near term, leaning into growth in nondiscretionary categories.\nWe'll also reinforce how the trust and loyalty we've built with our guests shows in our traffic and share gains. Given value is absolutely top of mind right now, being able to deliver affordable joy, differentiates us in the marketplace. And that's a clear advantage in the near term and remains our focus over the long term. With those factors in mind, we also want to use this time to set clear and realistic expectations so shareholders and stakeholders can track what progress looks like in 2023.\nTaking a step back, I might start by recognizing that our growth in '22 didn't come easily. It wasn't nearly as profitable as we expect it to be over time. In 2020 and 2021, our team put in the effort and the hustle to keep pace with the most turbulent business environment many of us have ever seen. They brought the expertise and excellence to take the company to a new level. But while we gained incredible scale by continuing to prioritize our guests, I acknowledge we're still developing some of the tools to marshal that scale efficiently.\nYet, as we think about what growth looks like from here, it's helpful to anchor back to what we were saying at year-end 2019. At that time, we were putting up proof points on a strategy that was and still is unique in retail, when we built to reliably deliver low single-digit increases in sales year after year. It started by investing in our team, in part because we believe human interaction is the key to growth in a digital age. As we move into 2023, we'll continue to support our team and lean into our culture, knowing they're at the heart of our overall success.\nThe 2019 strategy put stores at the center of everything. Because when we remodeled or added a store and improved the guest experience, comps grew. At the same time, turning stores into fulfillment hubs was and still is the most efficient and least costly way to grow omnichannel sales. As you'll hear today, we're not standing still on our store remodel and expansion plans or investments in a bigger supply chain or ongoing improvements in digital. It's no surprise that 100% of our store sales are fulfilled by stores. But in our case, more than 95% of all sales, including digital, are, too.\nSince 2019, our store base has only grown slightly, but total sales grew nearly 40% in that time frame. Our digital business nearly tripled in size, and our sales per square foot increased by 37%. And fulfilling substantially all that growth through essentially the same asset base was nothing short of incredible on the part of our team. So as we hold on to those gains and look to put growth on top of them, we'll continue to invest in stores, in supply chain, in digital through our stores as hubs model.\nOur 2019 strategy prioritized the differentiation and profit performance of an owned brand portfolio that is simply unmatched in retail. At the same time, we're curating national brands our guests love. And in 2019, we had just started our premier partnerships with Levi's and Disney. Since then, both those partnerships have expanded, as have our partnerships, with Apple and Starbucks. And as you know, we're in the middle of building on an incredibly exciting partnership with Ulta Beauty.\nMeanwhile, our team has built on our position of strength in owned brands, adding 17 of them since 2019. That includes 2 more $1 billion-plus brands in Good & Gather and All In Motion. But we're not slowing down with owned brands. In fact, just the opposite. As you'll hear from Christina, we're planning a steady cadence of newness in owned brands and national brands across our multi-category portfolio in the year ahead.\nWhat else was in the 2019 strategy? Well, that was a year we introduced Target Circle. At that time, it was a powerful new asset for guest engagement, personalization, loyalty and sales that quickly attracted 50 million users. Since 2019, the user base has doubled and is still growing meaningfully. And Circle has become the heart of our increasingly connected loyalty ecosystem.\nSince 2019, our media company, Roundel, has grown significantly with great additional growth and profit potential on the horizon. It's sought after by advertisers for its relevance and reach, and it's growing each year because our guests appreciate the engagement and the value it delivers. Roundel makes for more deeply engaged guests and partners. And because it gives us better understanding of our guest preferences, it makes us an even better and more profitable retailer. So we intend to place additional emphasis and investment towards Circle and Roundel in 2023, given the growth potential they'll unlock.\nSo let's pause here, and I'll start to put all this together. While I'm deliberately drawing a connection between 2019 and the year ahead, there's one giant difference, we're starting 2023 on a revenue base of $109 billion, not the $78 billion we had back then. There are other big differences, too. Today, we're reporting a full year comp increase in the low single digits, similar to 2019, and unit share gains across all 5 of our core merchandising categories. But unlike 2019, our 3-year revenue growth is $30-plus billion, not just $8 billion. And our digital penetration now stands at nearly 19%.\nDuring the pandemic, guests became more attached to Target. And as we deepened engagement with guests, more moved into the ranks of our most engaged, measured by spend, trips and cross-category purchases. Guest engagement is also reflected in a significant increase in transactions since 2019. In fact, those increases started as far back as 2017. And we're positioned to keep growing engagement levels across our guest base even as we focus on expanding that base overall.\nSo standing here today, my sense is that if a new normal is on the horizon, it will be much more like 2019 than the last 3 years. And as we plan prudently to invest in 2023, we see a return over time to solid and consistent growth with operating income margin rates that should move towards and then begin to move beyond our prepandemic rate of 6% in the next few years.\nToday, we'll show you our work for how we arrived at that conclusion. But a spoiler alert, it starts with the strategy. You've seen it many times before, and while the facets on this slide haven't changed, we're prioritizing to accelerate key growth drivers and making changes that will help us respond to the short-term environment, while continuing to advance all elements of our strategy. They all work together to keep our growth trajectory rolling.\nChristina will cover that in greater detail, including the focus this year were placing on the magic of Tar-zhay, on affordable joy and on digital growth, Target Circle, Roundel and our enterprise sustainability strategy, Target Forward. Then John will cover what we're learning from an ongoing operational evolution, what we're testing, what we're in the process of optimizing, what benefits we see from the standpoint of efficiency as we continue to scale. Michael will describe how we're planning cautiously, and we believe appropriately, given the economic challenges we anticipate this year.\nBut caution doesn't mean cut off from continued growth and progress. In fact, some of the most exciting progress we anticipate will be translating our newfound scale into simpler, more efficient ways to run Target. The difference between an enterprise-wide efficiency mindset and a cost-cutting program starts with what questions you ask yourself. For us, the question isn't, what can we cut? It's how do we make things easier for our team to more efficiently deliver a guest experience, that continues to live up to our brand promise. So we'll invite Mike O'Neil, the leader we tapped to coordinate these efforts across Target, to offer his perspective on efficiency, what it is, what it isn't, how we can drive continuous improvement and what we can unlock with this focus.\nWe're looking forward to the next hour or so. We recognize that the landscape is unpredictable, and there are plenty of near-term challenges on the horizon. We believe 2023 will be a year in which the durability of our model allows us to flex up the categories and the value proposition that are most relevant to our guests today. We'll double down on execution, so our guests get all they've been promised every time they turn to Target. And we'll stay focused on gaining share across our portfolio, underpinning all the work we're doing around efficiency, to provide fuel for longer-term growth. We're optimistic about what this team can deliver and realistic about how 2023 will keep challenging us to be agile, resilient and responsive for our guests, our communities, for each other and for our shareholders.\nBefore we leave here today, our goal is to take you along. So you can see exactly what we're seeing. And with that, let's get going.\n\nA. Christina Hennington\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. Despite the challenges of the past year, Target's differentiated position in retail has never been stronger. With a great assortment, compelling value, an unmatched suite of fulfillment options and a joyful shopping experience, Target continues to drive preference with American shoppers in the face of a turbulent economic and consumer backdrop.\nWe have continually adapted to the environment around us, delivering ease, value and inspiration to our guests, all at a time when daily doses of joy are needed more than ever. And amidst this volatility, we continue to hone the foundational elements that it takes to be a long-term winner in retail.\nFourth quarter comparable sales grew 0.7% on top of nearly 9% last year. And for the full year, comparable sales grew 2.2% on top of nearly 13% in 2021. While our business has been generating growth on top of growth for years now, the mix of last year's sales looked vastly different than what we had expected.\nThroughout 2022, changing attitude towards COVID, followed by the pressure from persistent inflation, caused demand for discretionary categories to slow meaningfully. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to this year's inventory commitments in many of these categories. And we're focusing on the agility of our operating model to adjust should sales trends exceed our expectations.\nIn light of the volatility we've experienced, I often get the question, what did Target learn from the past year? What I'll share with you today are some of the lessons learned. In short, we've learned that our strategy is working. At the same time, we've come to further appreciate the importance of strong day-to-day execution, combined with the agility required to react even quicker to changing consumer trends. And of course, last year, reinforced the importance of providing every guest with a great shopping experience.\nMost of what I'll share today likely won't sound all that different from the playbook we've used for the past few years. That is intentional. For example, our multicategory assortment continues to resonate with our guests, even as consumer demand continuously evolves. The unique balance we've achieved across all five of our core merchandising categories continues to be a key differentiator in the market, with each category serving at times as a trip driver, at other times as a basket builder, and often times as both.\nThroughout 2022, we saw and continue to see incredible growth in our Food & Beverage and Essentials & Beauty businesses, offsetting a meaningful pullback in discretionary categories like Home, Apparel and Hardlines. But despite this pullback, these discretionary categories still delivered around $55 billion in sales last year.\nIn both our Food & Beverage and Beauty categories, 2022 delivered the third consecutive year of double-digit sales growth, stemming from increases in both traffic and average ticket. And while we're thrilled to have driven unit share gains across all of our major categories last year, we saw the strongest gains in these rapidly growing frequency categories, a proof point of the relevance and value found in these assortments.\nIn Beauty, we continue to be a market leader, delivering the highest growth rates of any category we sell. We've been seeing outsized growth across the entire portfolio from everyday beauty assortments to new and exciting offerings like those we've added through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. In fact, last year's sales from Ulta Beauty at Target were more than 4x higher than in 2021, and this growth was almost entirely incremental. As such, we remain excited to continue opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and beyond.\nOf course, we don't build an assortment for a given snapshot in time. Rather, we flex across our categories as consumer demand shifts. And even in tough times, our discretionary assortment provides a unique opportunity to connect with guests in key moments, from major life changes, to seasonal celebrations and everyday moments in between.\nNow I want to be clear that despite our cautious inventory position in discretionary categories, we're still focused on delivering newness throughout the portfolio and placing select bets in businesses where we believe market share opportunities are strongest. That's because despite continued volatility the past year reinforced to us that Target guests are attracted to all things trendy and new. We believe our commitment to newness is a key reason why we continue to generate traffic growth, and why we drove broad unit share gains last year.\nOur focus on balance can be found within each category as well, where we continue to offer both industry-leading national brands and high-quality affordable owned brands that are unmatched by our competitors. Our owned brands have long been a source of pride and differentiation for Target, offering great style and quality, all at incredible value. So it's no surprise that our owned brands have continued to outpace total enterprise growth and why we have plans to launch new or extend assortments in more than 10 owned brands this year.\nRecently, a study listing the 10 fastest-growing private label brands in 2022 included three found exclusively at Target. Target was the only retailer to have more than one brand on the list, and two of them were the only nonfood brands to make the cut.\nMany retailers were not focused on newness in 2022, but the opposite was true at Target, where we continue to excite our guests with innovative and trendy products. For example, we launched Future Collective, a first-of-its-kind apparel owned brand, featuring collections in partnership with a rotating roster of diverse influencers. This innovative approach blending the strength of Target's owned brands with the excitement of our limited-time partnerships and collaborations has been a huge success, particularly with Black guests, furthering our commitment to ensure all guests see themselves reflected in our assortments.\nMost recently, we launched a new line with actor and influencer, Tabitha Brown. Tabitha's energy and passion absolutely shines in this new line, and our guests are loving it. Tabitha serves as the latest example of the endless possibilities that comes from bringing together the incredible talents of diverse designers and the power of Target's multi-category portfolio.\nTake a look and see what I mean.\n(presentation)\nThe passion of these designers is so inspiring, the emotion and pride is palpable, and we love the way the Tar-zhay magic of these partnerships cut across categories, including last quarter's launch of Marks & Spencer and Tabitha's recent extension into food.\nAnd while these collaborations offer joy for our guests, recent history has reinforced that focusing on the basics of retail is just as important as the latest innovation or new offering. In fact, nailing the fundamentals is the bedrock of a successful retailer, from the overall shopping experience to ease and convenience, relevance, everyday value and more.\nOf these fundamentals, we know that a strong and reliable shopping experience is the surest way to build trust and affinity. So we aim to provide a consistent, joyous and easy experience, both in stores and online, making Target a shopping destination, not just a means to an end. To do this, we've invested heavily in new stores, our remodel program and our same-day fulfillment services, as John will highlight shortly. We led the way in comprehensive pay and benefits, attracting and retaining the best team in retail, allowing us to provide a level of service unmatched by our competitors.\nWe've invested in one-of-a-kind brand partnership experiences like those with Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. And while some of these partnerships are newer, we've featured Starbucks in our stores for decades, proof that when we work with iconic brands, we build lasting relationships. With a Starbucks in nearly all of our stores, they have become part of the shopping ritual for many of our guests. In fact, we served up more than 170 million Starbucks beverages last year alone.\nA strong digital shopping experience is every bit as important as the one we create in our stores. So we've been investing to ensure that the experience is seamless across every channel, regardless of how our guests shop. Whether searching for an item or browsing for inspiration, we continue to elevate their experience, providing personalized and relevant content using our incredible data and guest insights. This will include more customized homepages, improved search functionality and even more personalized offers from Target Circle. It will also include more relevant content from our digital advertising business, Roundel. Our digital success won't be driven by a single service or offering, but through a comprehensive set of experiences designed to be greater than the sum of the parts.\nTarget Circle is one of the nation's leading loyalty programs with over 100 million members and growing. Through continuous learning and application of guest insights, Target Circle served up 3x more personalized offers in 2022 and Target Circle members spend 3x more on average this past holiday season.\nWe also continue to invest in the tools, team and capabilities of Roundel. To us, Roundel is more than a digital advertising platform or another revenue source in the P&L. The goal is for our guests to have a tailored, relevant experience, while helping our vendors reach the guests who are most likely to be interested in their products. Said simply, Roundel makes us better merchants, more consistently serving our guests with the products they want. This is why our approach to digital advertising looks different than others. We put our guests at the center of this strategy, just as we do in every other aspect of our business. It's no wonder we continue to see such explosive digital growth, why Roundel grew by more than 60% over the past 2 years, and why we'll continue to leverage the rich guest insights.\nAnd regardless of whether our guests are shopping online or in-store, they are looking for comprehensive value now more than ever. That means offering great everyday prices and promotions and offering quality and inspiration. After all, Target invented affordable joy decades ago and is still a key differentiator in a crowded retail market.\nOur guests see value in countless ways, from our competitively priced and high-quality owned brand offerings to multiple RedCard benefits, including 5% off on every trip and free shipping for all online orders, all with no annual fee. We offer compelling value at every turn, and we are continuously listening to our guests to understand what value means to them.\nAnd beyond these retail basics, we continue to hear from our guests that they prefer shopping with companies who prioritize people and planet. That's why we're so focused on our Target Forward strategy. This isn't a standalone strategy, but rather Target Forward is fully integrated throughout our business, fueling our growth potential, while bettering the world.\nAs part of this strategy, we'll continue to elevate Black voices and brands and are on track to spend $2 billion on Black-owned businesses by 2025. We'll also continue to focus on designing products for a circular future like in our owned brand, Universal Thread, where we are using materials such as recycled cotton and polyester. These are just a few of the countless examples of how we push ourselves and industry partners to grow sustainably.\nOur purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life requires a balance of quality, value and innovation that sets us apart from competitors. We are relentless in ensuring every decision supports this delicate balance. It's easy to say, but takes incredible diligence to execute. And while you've heard me say it before, it bears repeating now. We truly have the best team in retail. I'm so grateful for the many efforts of our team to serve our guests and each other, day in and day out.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to John.\n\nJohn J. Mulligan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. So Brian talked about the last few years being unpredictable. To put a finer point on that, if you had told me in late 2020, during the height of the pandemic, that 2022 would be the most challenging operating environment in my career, well, I would have assumed you were joking. Yet shifting consumer preferences, supply chain volatility and rising inflation created a set of conditions that called for flexibility, responsiveness and resilience. Our environment remains volatile, and we expect 2023 will have its own unique set of challenges. But if I've learned anything over the past 3 years, it's to never underestimate the power of a purpose-driven team and the culture they create.\n2022 offered more examples of Target teamwork than I can count, but two will stick with me for quite a while. 5 months ago when Hurricane Ian devastated communities across Florida, our team sprang into action. They didn't wait for me or Brian or anyone else on the leadership team to tell them what to do. Instead, they gathered input from those on the ground and told us what they needed. Pop-up resource centers that provided laundry, food, gas, restroom, showers and Wi-Fi-enabled laptops to 700 team members and their families. Extra inventory to stock local stores with essentials guests would need to weather the storm, and financial support, $5 million to fund local relief efforts and up to $3 million in matching donations to our team member giving fund, which provides assistance to team members affected by natural disasters.\nIt was about the same time that our inventory action plan was in full swing. You'll remember, we announced bold measures last summer to quickly take action to rightsize our inventory in response to shifting consumer demands. It was a big ask of our team, one that required them to move quickly and aggressively to reduce existing inventory and cut back on receipts for the back half of 2022. And the team responded as they always do with heart and hustle. They worked through 8 distribution centers worth of inventory in a matter of months, putting us in a strong position heading into the critical holiday season. That's our culture in action, bottom-up ingenuity centered on caring for our team and our guests. And it's that culture that fuels our strategy and growth.\nFor years now, we've shared our vision of using our stores as fulfillment hubs to get closer to our guests. It was an idea that was novel when we first introduced it, but it's been widely adopted as others expand their view of what stores can do. Now I'm an engineer to my core. So it gives me great satisfaction to see the way Target built our stores as hub strategy from the ground up and how our operating model gets stronger with each passing year.\nWe don't have a rigid road map. Instead, we use a highly repeatable process to test concepts, refine them, test them again, until we can replicate them with confidence, efficiency and scale. And then and only then do we ask ourselves what's next? And how can we make this even better? And the whole process begins again.\nLet's take Drive-Up. You can trace the origins of Drive-Up to the launch of our Store Pickup service a decade ago. It took a few years to get Store Pickup where we wanted and when we did, we were able to take it one step further with Drive-Up. We launched Drive-Up as a test in our Minneapolis market in 2017. By the following year, the service was available in more than 1,000 stores around the country, and it reached all 50 states in 2019.\nWith the foundation in place and operating at scale, we started to explore new capabilities. In 2020, we made fresh and frozen groceries available. In 2021, we added adult beverage and expanded our app to give guests a more customized experience. Last year, we began testing Starbucks at Drive-Up. And today, we're announcing the next phase of our Drive-Up services with Drive-Up Returns, which started as a pilot last year and will be available across the chain by the end of the summer.\nNot only is this a huge win for our guests who can now do even more at Drive-Up, but it brings more efficiency to our returns process, with more resale opportunities and fewer expenses for mail-in returns. We're combining the strength of our digital self-service returns process with our industry-leading Drive-Up experience to meet our guests where they are.\nThis is what it means to be a truly omnichannel retailer, giving our guests the flexibility, ease and convenience to shop the way that works best for them and scaling capabilities across every facet of our business. Online, in-store, Drive-Up, it doesn't matter how they choose to shop with us. We're here to make their Target run better than ever.\nLooking back, the evolution of Drive-Up may seem like it was a natural progression, easy to predict and implement. When you're bringing to market new ideas in an environment that is anything but stable, you have to be ready to adjust course and explore alternatives. Our team has gotten really good at moving in step with the needs of our guests. That flexibility and a commitment to the fundamentals that make or break a retailer, things like hiring the right people, offering the right products and delivering the right experiences to our guests, underpin our stores as hub strategy and contribute to our larger story of growth.\nSame-day services like Drive-Up are a great example. They grew nearly 7% last year as more shoppers appreciated the convenience and speed with which they can check off everything on their list. And because we own our same-day capabilities, pickup and Drive-Up are much more economical and flexible than other forms of digital fulfillment. In fact, our average fulfillment cost per unit has come down 40% over the past 4 years as our same-day services have grown to account for over half of our digital sales.\nAgain, these results don't happen overnight, and they aren't achieved in a vacuum. They are the product of steady investment and listening to our guests. Take our stores, which sit at the heart of our stores as hub strategy and play a dual role of shopping destination and fulfillment hub. Our stores are not only beautiful, with open floor design, plenty of natural light and design elements that reflect the communities they serve, they're built to keep inventory moving through our system and support Target's trajectory of growth.\nLate last year, we introduced a new store prototype in Katy, Texas. From the front entrance to the back room, this 150,000 square foot store is a stunner. Beautiful design elements reflect the local environment and community. Features like natural refrigerants, electric vehicle charging stations and rooftop solar empower our Target Forward sustainability ambitions and get us closer to our goal of net zero emissions by 2040. And a backroom 5x bigger than our average store allows us to ramp up same-day fulfillment, while preserving a seamless experience for our guests and our team.\nWe plan to open about 20 stores this year in a mix of sizes, from the shores of the outer banks in North Carolina, to the heart of Inglewood, California. We're also planning to invest in about 175 stores throughout the year, ranging from full remodels to the addition of shop-in-shop experiences like Ulta Beauty and retrofitted fulfillment spaces to support our same-day services. Our ongoing investment in our suite of stores is just one way we're building for the future.\nWhat might be less evident to our guests is how we're building facilities behind the scenes to make their experience even better. We've built upstream capacity by opening flow centers in Chicago and New Jersey, with several more slated to open over the next few years. And a new food distribution center that opened in Maryland this past October expand support for our growing food and beverage business. This additional capacity gives us more flexibility to manage inventory and keep our stores stocked with the items guests want when they want them.\nWe're also making investments downstream. Earlier this month, we announced the expansion of our sortation center network to more than 15 facilities by the end of 2026. These facilities have transformed how we move inventory with speed and precision to guests' doorsteps. We started with a prototype less than 2 years ago to see how we might bring more efficiency to how we sort, batch and route packages. Today, we have 9 sortation centers open across the country, allowing us to deliver packages to guests within 2 days. Up to 40% are delivered 1 day when using our last-mile delivery capabilities with Shipt. And because Shipt is fully integrated into our last-mile operations, we benefit from significantly lower delivery costs.\nTo give you a closer look at how these sortation centers have become core to our business, we ask leaders from Target and Shipt to give you a brief tour and talk about how our test and learn approach applies to last-mile delivery. Let's take a look.\n(presentation)\nAs you heard from [Doire], [Thad] and [Kamau], we've learned a lot over the past few years, using every opportunity to improve speed, cost and quality. And in regards, our sortation centers are just hitting their stride. We delivered more than 25 million packages through sortation centers last year, and we expect to double that amount in 2023 with the help of our local and national carriers.\nTogether, the investments we're making create a more nimble sourcing, inventory management and fulfillment capability at Target, and they continue to help us navigate tough times, prepare for the unpredictable and fuel steady growth, all thanks to our incredible team. We've made huge strides in recent years to connect with our guests through our stores. The momentum continues to build, and I look forward to sharing progress with you and our guests in the quarters to come.\nMichael, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. As Brian mentioned, it was exactly a year ago that we were on this stage, talking about our 2021 financial results, a year in which our business generated double-digit growth in comparable sales and even faster growth in EPS. And as Christina discussed, we knew on that day that the environment was likely to change, but we didn't yet know how dramatic those changes would be. The rapid pace of this transition led to multiple profit pressures on our business, including markdowns and other costs related to last year's inventory actions, significantly higher shipping and domestic transportation costs and higher inventory shrink.\nSo as we focus on our business plans, both for 2023 and the longer term, it's important to consider how the environment will continue to evolve. On the one hand, many things about life and consumer behavior already look a lot like they did before the pandemic. Students are back in school, sports arenas are full, people are eating out again and consumers are embracing in-store shopping.\nAt the other extreme, certain aspects of life appear to have changed forever. Many office jobs are now hybrid, with remote work and virtual meetings playing a much more significant role. That means many of us are spending a lot more time working at home, which has implications for long-term buying patterns in multiple categories, most notably our Food business.\nFulfillment mix has also seen a permanent shift. Our same-day services have seen explosive growth. They now account for more than half of our digital sales and more than 10% of our total sales. And that trend shows no signs of reversing. Even as people have remixed their trips in favor of in-store shopping, guest engagement with these digital services has continued to grow on top of the huge expansion that's occurred over the last few years.\nMost importantly, our guests' overall engagement with Target has increased significantly over the last few years, and it continues to grow. Think about it this way. In 2021, guests made about 2 billion trips to Target, which was about 300 million higher than in 2019. And last year, even as consumer spending moved away from products into services, traffic grew again. The deeper relationship we've established with our guests and our proven ability to deepen it further are some of the many reasons we're so well positioned to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.\nBeyond the factors that have changed permanently, there are several others that are clearly still in transition. These include transportation and the global supply chain, where we've already seen remarkable improvement, but we're still facing elevated costs and variability compared to the prepandemic period. Another factor is inventory shrink, which has increased broadly across U.S. retail over the past 2 years. And finally, the most significant and important driver of uncertainty today is the fact that the broad macro economy is still in transition, leading to an inflationary period, more pronounced than we've seen in decades.\nAs Christina mentioned, rapidly rising prices have put pressure on discretionary spending as consumers make room for higher prices on necessities. In addition, higher interest rates have further pressured budgets by increasing the cost of mortgages and car loans.\nSo where does that leave us today? Despite all of the recent turmoil and the pressures facing our business, we remain in a very strong position to drive healthy growth in the coming years. Our guests are more engaged than ever, and that engagement continued to grow even during a tumultuous year. And even after a year in which we experienced unique and unexpected headwinds to both our profitability and cash flow, our business is sound, it remains strong and we're laser-focused on the path forward.\nIn 2023, we'll focus first on agility and strong execution. Most notably, we'll take a cautious stance on our inventory commitments in markdown-sensitive categories, with the flexibility to sell into our base inventory and expand receipts over time. At the same time, we'll continue investing in our long-term strategic initiatives that propel our market share and profit growth, including our remodel program, our new store pipeline and projects to add replenishment capacity and increased efficiency in our supply chain.\nWe'll also focus on strengthening our balance sheet. In 2022, our business was a net user of cash for the first time in many years. This was driven by a host of unique factors, including unexpectedly low profitability, higher-than-expected CapEx driven by inflation and project costs and a rapid slowdown in inventory turns due to excess inventory and longer lead times in global shipping.\nThis year, we expect each of those factors to become more favorable. More specifically, we're expecting an increase in profit dollars and a somewhat slower pace of CapEx. And given our cautious inventory positioning and rapidly improving lead times in global shipping, we're planning for faster inventory turns in 2023, driving higher payables leverage and recovery in working capital as we move through the year.\nIn the near term, until those expectations play out and our cash generation increases, we're not planning to repurchase any shares, consistent with our goal to maintain our middle A credit ratings. Over time, as our cash flow recovers and our debt metrics improve, we expect share repurchases will play a meaningful role within our broader, long-term capital deployment priorities. But as always, those repurchases will only occur after we fully invested in our business and supported our team, after we've supported our dividend goals and within the limits of our middle A ratings.\nNow I want to share some thoughts on our 2023 outlook, and I'll start with our expectations for the first quarter. Given the current conditions we're facing, we expect our business to generate first quarter comparable sales in a wide range, from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase. This reflects our expectation for continued strength in our frequency businesses, offset by softness in discretionary categories.\nOn the operating income line, we're expecting a first quarter rate in the 4% to 5% range, higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter, but down somewhat from the 5.3% our business generated in last year's first quarter. While there are a number of factors driving this expectation, I'd note that our first quarter SG&A expense rate is expected to be about 1 percentage point higher than a year ago, reflecting continued investments in our team and guest experience, without an expected leverage benefit from higher sales. Altogether, on the bottom line, we expect our business to generate first quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.50 to $1.90.\nNow I'll turn to our full year expectations, and I'll first note that the range of potential outcomes gets wider as the year goes on, given the high degree of uncertainty regarding the strength of the economy and the consumer. Given this uncertainty, we firmly believe caution is the appropriate posture, especially when planning sales and inventory in discretionary categories.\nOn the frequency side of the business, our full year plans envision continued share gains and strong sales growth. But we're mindful that inflation in these categories may begin to moderate, pressuring dollar comps across the industry. In light of those considerations, along with our outlook for discretionary categories, we're planning for the same wide range on the top line that we're planning for the first quarter, from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase in our comparable sales.\nIn terms of profitability, the range of potential outcomes is similarly wide. As I mentioned earlier, we're positioned to benefit from a number of significant tailwinds on the gross margin line, most notably as we cycle over last year's inventory actions. In addition, we're expecting hundreds of millions of dollars of additional opportunity from lapping last year's unusually high freight and transportation costs.\nAt the same time, we're also preparing for some notable headwinds on the gross margin line. These include inventory shrink, which may continue to rise before we see rates begin to moderate over time. We're also expecting some pressure from soft sales in our highest-margin discretionary categories. And finally, we see the potential for increased promotional intensity across the industry this year, given that we're competing in a constrained environment for consumer spending.\nOn the SG&A line this year, we expect continued strong discipline in managing costs across the enterprise, but we're also not backing away from investments in our team and guest experience, and we'll face potential rate deleverage given our outlook for comparable sales.\nIn light of these considerations, we're planning for a wide range of potential outcomes for our full year operating income. But even at the low end of those expectations, we expect to grow our operating income by more than $1 billion this year. Altogether, our expectations translate to a full year GAAP and adjusted EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75, which represents growth of about $1.75 per share at the low end of the range.\nOn the CapEx line this year, we're expecting to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion. While this range is somewhat lower than last year's CapEx, it's quite strong relative to our history. This year's plan reflects the optimal level to invest in the current environment and our expectation that we'll continue to earn high returns on our long-term growth investments, including our remodel program and new store pipeline and our continued work to build capacity and capabilities in our supply chain.\nAs we think about the longer-term trajectory of our business, we expect that as external conditions normalize in the next several years, our operating income margin rate should reach and begin to move beyond our prepandemic rate of 6%. This return to prepandemic levels could happen as early as 2024, depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand.\nI want to pause and emphasize that this year's guidance does not reflect how we expect our business to perform over the longer term. Once we see a normalization of consumer demand and a resumption of growth in discretionary categories, you'll see that reflected in a stronger top line performance and a meaningful increase in our operating margin rate beyond what we're planning for this year.\nI also want to reiterate something we've said many times. While we often talk about rates because it's helpful for analytical purposes, our goal is to find the optimal rate that maximizes profit dollar growth over time. In other words, we'll continue to focus simultaneously on top line growth and the rate we earn on it without focusing on either metric in isolation.\nSo now before I invite Brian and Mike O'Neil to join me on stage, I want to pause and thank our team for their continued optimism and resilience through a turbulent year. Last year presented a host of unexpected and unprecedented challenges that all seemed to arrive at once. Through it all, our team maintained a long-term focus, serving our guests and taking care of each other.\nAs a result, we saw continued expansion in guest traffic and engagement throughout the year and historically strong hiring and retention metrics across our team. Those are some of the most important factors in determining our long-term success and why I feel so confident about Target's potential in the years ahead.\nNow I'd like to invite Brian and Mike O'Neil to join me on stage so we can have a brief conversation about the enterprise efficiency work we've asked Mike to lead.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, Michael, thank you, and Mike, thanks for joining us today. I know everyone would like to get into the work, but I think it would be really helpful to just pause for a second and talk about your background and why we selected you to lead this very important initiative.\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nYes. Thanks, Brian. Really happy to be here and excited about the opportunity to lead this work for Target. I've been at Target now for 15-plus years, started in finance, worked in various roles with our merchandising operation partners to help deliver on their strategic priorities and their financial growth. Through that experience, I got to see the business model through the lens of the P&L.\nA couple of years ago, I went over then to human resources and led our pay and benefits and strategic workforce planning teams. And that was a great opportunity to see the business through the lens of our team members. I had a chance to lead that team during the early days of the pandemic and saw quickly the work our team does to take -- the importance of taking care of them to take care of our guests.\nFrom there, I've been back now in finance for a couple of years, and was leading the financial planning and analysis teams where we work with every business function to deliver on both our finance and strategic priorities. And coming back to finance and seeing the growth we've seen over the last couple of years, it was pretty apparent to me the opportunity to step back and think about how do we run this business model now at the larger scale. And so I think with those experiences, plus the relationships I've built over these 15 years, I think, position me well to lead this work forward.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nMike, when you took on this role, we spent a lot of time talking about what this work's about and what it isn't. Can you share a bit about the reasons we've initiated the work and what we're looking to accomplish?\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nYes. I think I'll start maybe with what it isn't. This isn't about sacrificing long-term growth for short-term profits. A typical tactic here is to look to shrink your cost base in the face of declining revenues. Well, that's not Target, right? We are growing, continue to grow. In fact, this work has come out from the growth we've seen over the last 3 years. We've grown $30 billion -- over $30 billion since 2019. That's more than 14 years prior. And that creates a tremendous opportunity to step back and reimagine how do we operate this business at a larger scale, but more importantly, how do we position Target for future growth.\nAnd so as we're looking for efficiencies, we'll look for ways to simplify the work, to streamline processes, to reduce redundancy, all with the mind of how do we make it easier for our team members to deliver a great guest experience. In doing so, our initial scoping says, we'll deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of cost savings over the next 3 years.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Mike, I want to clarify one thing briefly. After Brian and I mentioned this effort in our last earnings call, we got some questions about whether that $2 billion to $3 billion number includes the natural recovery from the headwinds we experienced in 2022. Can you help clarify that?\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nSure. I've got a couple of those questions as well. And I would say, I reiterate that this is not about the work over -- or what's happened to us over the last 12 months. It's about the growth that we've seen over the last 3 years. And so no, what's not included is anything that will come, the natural recovery from the headwinds of last year. This work is the designed to deliver fuel beyond that, both to deliver on our -- both our top line and our bottom line goals.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMike, when we asked you to lead this project, we spent a lot of time thinking about the guardrails. Now obviously, there's big opportunities that we want to capture. But there's also things we never want to compromise. Do you want to talk about the opportunities versus the guardrail of let's say, \"We'll never head in this direction?\"\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nYes, I think that's a really important question. And the things we're not willing to sacrifice start with a team member and the guest experience. We're not going to take away anything given the investments we've made in our team over the last couple of years, and spending that time in human resources during those early days of the pandemic had an appreciation for all our team did to run our business and to serve our guests. And so I look at our team members and the investments we make as an investment in the best team in retail.\nSimilarly, on the guest side, our shopping experience is a key differentiator for Target, and we're not looking at anything to take away from that. In fact, our guiding principle around this work is, how do you make it easier for our team members to run our business and in doing so, deliver a great guest experience? And so we do that, we think we'll see benefits to both the team and our guests.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nMike, since we first announced this work, I've had a bunch of investors ask me where they should expect to see the results of this work show up in the P&L? Can you share your initial thoughts?\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nSure. I think it's -- you're going to see it across the full P&L. So I'm not sure you're going to be isolating it to one single component. What excites me about this work, though, as we think about running the different scale, I think there's top line opportunity. And so it's going to start with sales. Now we're not going to do anything against the -- we're going to continue to invest in our team, but any efficiency work will have SG&A impact on the SG&A line. And product costs continue to be our biggest line item on the P&L, so we'll see it there as well. But I also will say it'll expand beyond the P&L as we look to be more efficient in our CapEx.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSo Mike, I know you're still in the early stages of scoping the work, but there's also things that we've been working on for quite some time now that we can build on. Do you want to highlight some of those?\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nSure. We touched base on a lot this morning that work around digital fulfillment, I think, is a great example. We've been -- that work in several years underway, when you think about our stores as hub model, has significantly decreased our fulfillment cost. John mentioned 40% over 3 years.\nWe've also been able to increase speed of delivery and improved the guest experience across all those different nodes, whether that's ship-to-home, Drive-Up, Order Pick up or Shipt delivery, and it's extremely capital efficient.\nIf you look forward now, we think there's hundreds of million dollars to continue to unlock with our investment in sortation centers. That's a business -- that's a capability that's been on our road map for a few years now, but requires scale and density at the market level to unlock. And given the growth over the last 3 years, we now have that.\nAnd so we think there's opportunity in a dozen of metro markets. We already have 9 facilities out there and plan to have a total of 15 by 2026. And so we'll open those up, but also we'll make those centers more efficient as well as we think about streamlining processes in them and looking to introduce automation and technology.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Can you also provide an example of a newer effort you're excited about?\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nYes. I think the best example is the work that's underway now in Apparel. This one is near and dear to my heart. My first role at Target was the finance partner for our women's apparel business. I also think it serves as a really great example of what is possible with this work. Apparel, just like the rest of our business, has seen explosive growth. We've grown over $3 billion and now a over $17 billion business in Apparel business. It also has its unique complexities, right, from the fact that we partner with vendors to source raw materials, to the fact that we have unique fixtures in store for presentation. So all the geographical and weather and demographic considerations that go into assortment planning and allocation.\nAnd so that growth, combined with that complexity, makes a tremendous opportunity to step back and say, how do we run this business at a larger scale and how do we position it for future growth? And so we're focused right now on driving simplicity, speed and consistency across the entire pair of value chain. And in doing so, we expect to see benefits from assortment planning, to supply chain, all the way down to guest fulfillment.\nAnd the benefits will be across the P&L. We'll see it in lower markdowns, we'll see it in increased productivity -- labor productivity, and we'll see it in top line sales. And so I love that example because it gives you a chance to step back and say, look, we've seen this growth over the last 3 years. How do we look end-to-end across the value chain to position it differently? How do we simplify for the work for our guests? And in doing so, we believe we'll see benefits across the P&L with the most important one being top line sales.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSo Mike, I love the way you framed this up. This is all about fueling future growth, driving simplicity, reducing complexity, never compromising the guest experience and the role our teams play. Are there any other components as you think about this, that you want to touch upon?\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nWell, I'd say thanks for letting me come up to share just a couple of examples. I would say -- I'd reiterate is this starts with growth. It starts about how do we make it simple and easier for our team members to deliver a great experience. And that work is going to be a multiyear journey, and this will require end-to-end problem solving across the value chain. But when we do that, we focus on making a better team member experience. We'll see a better impact to our team, our guests and our P&L.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, Mike, I want to thank you for joining us on stage here today. We're really excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. You've heard a few examples today, and we'll continue to provide updates along the way.\nSo Mike, thank you for joining us.\n\nMichael O'Neil\n\nSVP of Enterprise Efficiency, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nMichael, I'll have you back here in a second.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nGreat.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nSo as we get ready to hear from you and take your questions, I thought I'd briefly recap some of the themes you've heard today. First, our commitment to our guests is as strong as ever. Second, our strategy, our multi-category portfolio, our stores as hub model will provide the flexibility we need to keep growing because we're going to stay closely connected to our guests. Finally, there have been some fundamental changes at Target over the last 3 years. We're more than $30 billion bigger. We set the omnichannel standard with stores as hubs. We'll continue to build and innovate in that realm. We'll set the pace in supporting and developing the very best team in retail.\nPerhaps the most important takeaway is something that hasn't changed, and that's our ability to shift our business and our categories in step with our guests. If they need to prioritize food and essentials, we'll lean into those categories. But as you heard from Christina, in a year when discretionary spending was down, our discretionary categories generated $55 billion in sales. Our guests today are responding to newness. They're celebrating seasons as we just saw with Valentine's Day. They're eager to be out in our stores and enjoying that guest experience, and we're seeing it in our traffic growth. And we know they really value affordable joy.\nSo we remain fully committed to our multi-category portfolio, to essentials and to our discretionary categories. And as our guests lean back in discretionary categories over time, we'll be ready to flex into those trends, building substantially on the near-term plans we share today.\nWe know that will happen. But in the meantime, we're moving forward thoughtfully. We're doubling down on retail fundamentals. We're finding fuel for further growth through efficiency. And while we're emphasizing prudence in our near-term performance, I am incredibly positive about the long-term potential and our ability to translate both into positive outcomes for all stakeholders, including shareholder returns over time.\nSo I want to close by thanking our team as they tune in from around the globe, and thanking all of you for staying with us on this journey.\nAnd with that, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to come back, and we'll open it up for your questions.",

Welcome to Target Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 16, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of IR, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.\nThis morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.\nAnd finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the third quarter and his perspective on the upcoming holiday season. Brian?\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. As I begin the call today, I want to highlight the proactive leadership position we will continue to take as the operating environment changes. Just as we took decisive action in the second quarter to rightsize our inventory, we're moving proactively in a period of rapidly softening demand and elevated uncertainty to successfully navigate near-term challenges alongside our team and in step with our guests.\nAs we look specifically at third quarter results, they demonstrate how our business continues to serve our guests even in the face of an increasingly challenging backdrop. Because of the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests over the last several years, our top line continues to benefit from growth in guest traffic and unit share gains across all of our core categories. This is particularly notable as consumers are showing increasing signs of stress and pulling back from discretionary purchases, and it reinforces the value of having a balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to satisfy our guests' ever-changing needs.\nIn today's environment, that means we continue to benefit from strong growth and market share gains in the categories our guests are leaning into most right now, including Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials. Q3 comparable sales grew 2.7% on top of 12.7% a year ago and 20.7% in the third quarter of 2020.\nAs you recall, early in the second quarter, we announced we would be taking decisive inventory actions based on the rapid change in consumer buying patterns that emerged near the end of the first quarter. These actions were designed to ensure we could continue to provide what our guests know and love about Target. More specifically, the effort was designed to free up space in our stores and hours for our team to continue offering fresh inventory and a reliable, uncluttered shopping experience for our guests, setting up our business to deliver strong growth in Q3.\nAmong the drivers of our comparable sales, third quarter traffic expanded 1.4% on top of 12.9% growth a year ago. In addition to traffic growth, we saw a 1.3% increase in average ticket as guests continue to rely on Target for convenient, reliable one-stop shop. Across our merchandise categories and similar to the second quarter, we saw very strong growth in our frequency businesses, led by double-digit growth in both Beauty and Food & Beverage. That strength offset persistent softness in our discretionary categories, which worsened at the end of the quarter. Christina will provide more detail in a few minutes.\nWhile overall Q3 comp growth was nearly identical to our second quarter performance, we experienced dramatically different trends within the quarter. More specifically, through the first 2 months of the quarter, we had seen comp growth of well over 3%, and then saw a deceleration to just under 1% in October.\nEven within the month of October results in the back half of the month were much softer than in the first half and the mix of our sales tilted much more heavily towards promotions. This rapid change in trend is consistent with what we're seeing in syndicated data on broader industry trends and the feedback we're hearing from our guests. More specifically, consumers are feeling increasing levels of stress, driven by persistently high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and an elevated sense of uncertainty about their economic prospects.\nWith high rates of inflation continuing to erode their purchasing power, many consumers this year have relied on borrowing or dipping into their savings to manage their weekly budgets. But for many consumers, those options are starting to run out. As a result, our guests are exhibiting increasing price sensitivity, becoming more focused on and responsive to promotions and more hesitant to purchase at full price.\nOn the profit line, we saw an expected improvement in the third quarter as we move beyond the bulk of those costs from our second quarter inventory actions. However, Q3 profitability came in well below our expectations, driven by several factors. First and foremost, we faced an unexpected gross margin rate headwind from a higher-than-expected mix of promotional sales as guests moved away from full price purchases.\nIn addition, like the rest of the industry, we're facing a growing financial headwind from shortage, which is running hundreds of millions of dollars higher than a year ago. Along with other retailers, we've seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business. As a result, we're making significant investments in training and technology that can deter theft and keep our guests and store team members safe.\nLooking ahead and taking recent trends into account, our team is making adjustments in real time with agility and flexibility in light of the revised expectations for both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. It's in tough environments like these that we're most fortunate to have a durable business model and a strong balance sheet, allowing us to maintain our focus on long-term investments and market share opportunities at a time when many others will be forced to pull back. And to create additional capacity for us to continue investing in long-term growth and market share while also delivering strong bottom line performance, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to identify opportunities to simplify and enhance the efficiencies of our business.\nI want to make it clear. This effort is not about slashing resources. Instead, it's about optimizing our operations to match the scale of our business. This effort is particularly important today because of the rapid and unanticipated level of scale our business has added since 2019 as total revenues have grown from less than $80 billion in 2019 to a projection of well over $100 billion this year.\nWhile our team has done an excellent job of staying agile and quickly accommodating all that growth. We now have an opportunity to look from top to bottom across all of our operations to ensure they are fully optimized for the size of our business. We're still in the process of fully scoping out this effort, but we believe it presents an opportunity to save a total of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next 3 years in support of our investments in long-term growth, along with our profit goals.\nIn the near term, our team is energized and laser-focused on bringing the best of Target to our guests throughout the holiday season, knowing it's critically important for Target to be there for them during the busiest time of the year. Our team is committed to offering value across our entire assortment through great everyday prices, unbeatable value on our owned brands and accessible opening price points in every category.\nIn addition, we'll highlight our compelling and simple promotions, free services like Drive-Up and in-store pickup and new accessible payment options. And of course, we'll provide additional savings opportunities through our RedCard and Target Circle programs, neither of which has a membership fee.\nSo as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank the entire Target team for your energy, your spirit, your care for each other and your passion for our guests and our brand. You're the reason that Target has such a positive impact on the communities where we live and work and the reason we're known as a welcoming and inclusive brand.\nThank you, and happy holidays to all of you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina.\n\nA. Christina Hennington\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The current retail environment requires tremendous levels of flexibility, resilience, stamina and focus, a balance our team continues to carry out at every guest interaction. Consumers are strained as they work to support their families' day-to-day needs while looking for the occasional affordable luxury, prepping for the changing seasons and planning for the holidays.\nIt's a difficult balance to strike and getting increasingly difficult each week as more and more of their household budget goes towards the needs of the family, which limits the amount available for discretionary purchases. So it follows that of the many considerations that our guests are currently juggling, we consistently hear that value remains at the top of the list. We see our guests holding out for and expecting promotions more than ever, spending less on regularly priced items.\nWhen they shop our frequency categories, some guests are trading into smaller pack sizes, opening price point options or owned brands to reduce their spending on a single trip. Others are opting for larger pack sizes or stocking up when items are on promotion, knowing they will receive greater per unit value. And these trends only became more pronounced towards the end of the third quarter when spending patterns changed dramatically.\nWith inflationary food prices absorbing more of their spending, those costs are crowding out other categories, including spending on discretionary items, and in some cases, even household essentials. However, we also know both from our recent performance and from guest surveys that despite the pressures they're facing, our guests want to celebrate the holidays in person with loved ones, and they're looking for Target to provide them safety, ease and joy as they prepare for every celebration.\nThese themes played out in the third quarter as guests responded increasingly to promotions, even as they celebrated key seasonal moments like back-to-school, college and Halloween. Among our frequency categories, Beauty continues to drive strong performance, delivering sales growth in the mid-teens. Skin care, hair care and cosmetics, all performed very well and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings nearly tripled their total sales volume when compared to this period a year ago.\nFood & Beverage continues to outperform the market with low double-digit growth and strength across the portfolio, gaining both dollar and unit share every week throughout the quarter. Comparable sales in Essentials categories grew in the low single digits, reflecting particular strength in pets and health.\nWhile already soft, sales trends in our discretionary categories softened even more in the last few weeks of the quarter, a trend that's persisted into the first few weeks of November. But importantly, despite this challenging environment, we still saw unit share gains in all 5 of our core merchandising categories in the quarter, a sign that when guests are looking for convenience and value on both wants and needs, they're increasingly turning to Target.\nApparel comps were down only slightly in Q3, driven by growth in kids, men's, seasonal and new fashion forward assortments, offset by softness in swim, women's accessories and basics. In Home, sales declined in the mid-single digits despite strong performance in seasonal areas. Hardlines sales were also down mid-single digits reflecting continued softness in home electronics and sporting goods. Additionally, we saw a meaningful deceleration in toys this quarter, most notably in October. This is a trend we will continue to monitor closely as we move throughout the holiday season.\nAcross the portfolio, owned brands continue to outperform their national brand counterparts, growing at double the rate of the total enterprise in the third quarter. Because of our unique industry-leading, in-house design and sourcing capabilities, Target's exclusive owned brands provide tremendous quality at incredibly competitive prices, a great combination anytime but never more so than in an inflationary environment.\nSo as we turn our focus to Q4, we'll do what we always do, work tirelessly to deliver value and solutions to our guests while also delivering affordable joy at a time when they need it most. As we've outlined this morning, we're taking a prudent approach to our inventory planning and sales expectations for the fourth quarter in light of the concerning industry trends we've seen over the past several weeks. But even with this cautious stance, we're focused on providing our guests with affordability and ease at every interaction with the Target brand.\nOne of the signature ways we plan to stand out this holiday season is through our focus on the combination of newness and value, which cut across all our core categories. Given that the gift-giving season is underway and our guests are turning to Target more and more for their Food & Beverage needs, it's an ideal time for our recently announced partnership with British retailer, Marks & Spencer, who has collaborated with us to offer a limited time assortment of gourmet, premium food and chocolates, that's sure to be a perfect gifting solution this holiday season.\nDespite recent trends in toys, we know they will play a critical role for our guests over the holiday season, and we have all the top toys and exclusives this year at incredible prices. Back by popular demand, our exclusive assortment from FAO Schwartz features more than 120 toys. And for all the Marvel fans out there, the first of its kind collaboration between Target and Disney will feature exclusive Black Panther merchandise and experiences, including the only-at-Target, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever War on the Water LEGO set.\nAnd the power of these partnerships doesn't stop there. We've added nearly 50 Disney shop-in-shop experiences this year, bringing the total to well over 200 of these shops across the country. In partnership with Apple, we've more than tripled the number of shop-in-shops since last year, and our Target Circle members have access to free trials of some incredible Apple services, including a free 4-month trial of Apple Fitness+. And with Ulta Beauty at Target, we'll have opened another 250 locations this year and now have more than 350 locations open across the chain.\nThrough all our new tried-and-true and exclusive holiday offerings, we'll remain laser-focused on supporting our value proposition with key deals starting earlier than ever. Week-long Black Friday deals and our guest-favorite Deal of the Day offers are available now and feature our best plan prices for the season, with prices up to 50% off across toys and games, electronics, kitchen appliances and more. Besides industry-leading promotions, we are offering compelling, easy to shop, everyday price points on key items like $3 Christmas ornaments, $5 holiday Wondershop and candle assortments, and $10 gifting assortments across categories like Beauty, Apparel and Home.\nAnd to reinforce our commitment to value, we'll be offering free and easy payment and fulfillment options, including our recently launched reloadable RedCards, which provides all the benefits of our RedCard debit and credit programs, including free shipping and 5% off every purchase, all without the need for a credit check or an existing bank account. Combine this with our easy, convenient and free same-day service options like Drive-Up and order pickup, all with no membership fees and our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle, we have an unmatched combination of value-added and affordable shopping experiences to help our guests celebrate and amplify the joy of the holidays.\nThroughout the season, we will remain nimble and respond to changes in consumer promotional and macro trends, always in service of optimizing current and long-term performance. And despite the challenges facing our business and our guests, we have a not-so-secret-weapon to help us provide joy and value for our guests, a world-class team. Like Brian, I want to pause and add my sincere gratitude for the Target team. No matter what is thrown your way, you execute with grace compassion and consistency, a combination that leads our guests to return to our stores and website time and time again.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn J. Mulligan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina. Across the operations team, we focus every day on delivering strong execution, even as we continue to keep our eyes on and invest in projects that will support Target's long-term profitable growth. As you know, throughout the year, our supply chain and transportation teams have been continuously navigating through an unpredictable environment, and these volatile conditions continued in the third quarter. The good news is that the lead times in global shipping has started to move in the right direction. More specifically, compared with the second quarter, lead times improved by about 15% in Q3, and were more than 3 weeks shorter than a year ago.\nWhile we were really pleased to see this improvement, the acceleration was faster than we expected, causing many overseas orders to arrive earlier than needed. As a result, the team has been reducing lead times on our future orders just as they extended them during the pandemic.\nIn addition, to prevent early arrivals from entering our distribution and store network before they are needed, the team has implemented multiple strategies and tactics, including new processes to efficiently segment shipping containers as they arrive at domestic ports, allowing early arriving containers to age before sending them downstream into our regional distribution centers.\nSo today, even as we continue to look heavy on the balance sheet, our inventory is in a much healthier position than earlier in the year. Because the heaviness you're seeing today is due to the early arrival of fresh inventory, we are planning to sell. For example, by early November of this year, nearly 90% of our key Q4 programs had already moved into our distribution centers and stores. In contrast, last year, just over half our key programs were in the network as of the same time frame.\nSimilar to our experience with lead times, we saw improvement across multiple dimensions of our transportation costs in the quarter, even as those costs remain above pre-pandemic levels. Container rates in global shipping have come down by about 1/3 in recent months, and we'll realize that benefit in 2023 as we renegotiate our staggered contracts with shipping partners. And importantly, we expect to see further reductions in those rates going forward as they remain about 3x higher than we were paying in 2019.\nSimilarly, domestic transportation rates have come down since the beginning of the year, but remain higher than a year ago and double the rates we were facing in 2019. And of course, fuel costs, which are a major driver of our domestic transportation expense are still running more than double the amount we were paying in 2019 despite having moderated in recent months.\nNow I'll turn to the work of our properties team, where we're still wrapping up some projects but close to completing our supply chain and store projects for the year. On the distribution side, we're continuing our work to build replenishment capacity across the country, given the amount of growth we've delivered over the last few years.\nThe other big addition to our distribution infrastructure is the build-out of our sortation center strategy. A year ago, we were operating a single sort center here in the Minneapolis market. And this year, we've opened 5 more with several more on track to open in 2023. These centers, which are typically a little bigger than a single store, increase our speed and meaningfully reduce our last-mile delivery costs in the markets where they operate. They also create backroom fulfillment capacity in the stores they serve, as they eliminate the need for each individual store to sort the boxes they've packed for delivery.\nOn the store side, we are on track to complete about 200 full remodel projects this year in which we update every part of the store to reflect our latest thinking and offer a modern and inspirational shopping experience for our guests. Beyond full remodels, we're also on track to complete about 200 fulfillment retrofits this year in which we optimize their capacity and efficiency in supporting our same-day services.\nAnd finally, the team is on track to complete our new store program for 2022, in which we plan to add 23 new locations to the chain. The size of these new stores ranges widely from 19,000 to 145,000 square feet as we continue to open the right size store for the neighborhood we're serving. And as we've mentioned in recent calls, based on evolving conditions in the commercial real estate market, we've been finding more and more opportunities to open larger locations that can offer the full range of our assortment, along with a full suite of fulfillment options to serve our guests.\nIn light of that opportunity, just over a week ago, we opened the first example of a new larger store prototype in the Houston, Texas market. At nearly 150,000 square feet, this new format incorporates our latest thinking in store design, featuring a more open layout, localized elements to inspire and serve our guests, 5x more space to support our digital fulfillment services and sustainable features in support of our Target-forward goals. While we'll continue to open new stores of all sizes in the next few years, we plan to lean into this new layout when appropriate and incorporate its features into other projects, including remodels.\nAmong the many innovations we've incorporated into this new location in Houston, we've added 2 new Drive-Up services. The first is the ability for a guest to order a beverage from Starbucks on their way to pick up their Drive-Up order. We started testing this new service in the second quarter with a limited menu in a small number of stores, allowing us to collect feedback and fine-tune operations before expanding it more broadly. Based on the success of that pilot, earlier this month, we rolled it out to more than 200 additional stores across the country, just in time for the holidays.\nThe other emerging capability is the ability for a guest to return a purchase through our Drive-Up service. We began testing this service only a month ago with our team members in a small number of stores, consistent with our test-and-iterate approach. Based on the operational success of that initial test, in early November, we expanded the service to our guests in that same small set of stores, and we'll look to apply any learnings from that guest-facing test before rolling out the service more broadly next year.\nSo now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams across the country who have worked tirelessly to ensure we are staffed and ready to serve our guests during the upcoming holiday season, our busiest time of the year. Consistent with prior years, before determining our seasonal hiring goals, we focused first on providing opportunities to our existing team to support their desired hours and backup training interests.\nAnd today, based on all that hard work in preparation, I'm happy to report that we're entering the holiday season in a very healthy staffing position, reflecting our success in hiring throughout the year, the significant wage investments we've made throughout the country, an increase in the number of team members who are looking to pick up extra hours and an 18% increase in applicants for seasonal positions compared with a year ago.\nAs Brian mentioned, it's in times like these that we feel most fortunate to have a durable business model, which can sustain us through an ever more challenging economic and consumer backdrop and allow us to emerge with additional profitable growth and market share opportunities over time. That's why we're ensuring our teams are staying focused on our guests and taking the right actions to continue deepening our relationship with them. If we maintain that guest focus, I'm confident we'll find ourselves in an even stronger competitive position over time.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. I want to start where John just ended and reiterate how closely we're listening to our guests, ensuring we understand how they're feeling and how that is affecting their shopping behavior and moving quickly to serve their rapidly-changing needs. Obviously, if recent softening consumer trends continue through the fourth quarter, that will put some pressure on our near-term financial performance. But with a durable model and an agile team, we can navigate those challenges and emerge even stronger in the long term while continuing to deepen our relationship with guests and build long-term preference for Target.\nOnce again, this quarter, I'm going to begin my remarks by covering our inventory position, given that it continues to be an important area of focus. And like last quarter, I'm going to base my discussion on comparisons to 2019, given the highly volatile conditions that have affected inventory since the onset of the pandemic.\nAs you saw on our balance sheet this morning, we owned $17.1 billion of inventory at the end of the third quarter, which is $5.7 billion higher than the end of Q3 2019. In percentage terms, this year's number represents an approximate 50% increase from 3 years ago, a deceleration from 3-year growth of 68% as of the end of the second quarter.\nOf the dollar increase in our inventory since 2019, about 2/3 or $3.9 billion is aligned with our sales growth over that same 3-year period. The remaining 1/3 or about $1.8 billion is new inventory that's arrived early relative to when it would have been received in pre-pandemic years.\nThis early inventory is being driven by 2 related factors. The first is our explicit decision to add cushion to our lead times this year in order to mitigate the risk we were facing a year ago when the bulk of our global shipments were arriving late. The second factor is the unexpectedly rapid acceleration in the global supply chain that we saw in Q3, which caused us to receive shipments even earlier than scheduled.\nIt's also important to note that the composition of our inventory continues to evolve as we've leaned into frequency categories where we're seeing robust growth and taken an increasingly cautious position in discretionary categories. More specifically, the percent of our inventory units in discretionary categories was 8 percentage points lower than at the end of Q2 and lower than in 2019 as well.\nWith that context, I'll turn to our third quarter financial performance, beginning with the top line. Total sales grew 3.3% in the third quarter, the same as in Q2, driven by a 2.7% increase in comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores. Total revenue grew 3.4% in Q3, reflecting a 9.5% increase in other revenue, which was driven by the growth in our Roundel ad business. Traffic continues to be an important driver of our growth, having expanded 1.4% in Q3 on top of nearly 13% growth a year ago. In addition, this quarter, we benefited from a 1.3% increase in average ticket.\nAmong our sales channels, stores continue to drive our growth as we saw a 3.2% increase in store comparable sales in Q3 on top of nearly 10% growth a year ago. Comparable sales in our digital channel grew 0.3% in the quarter on top of nearly 30% last year. Same-day services led our digital growth, most notably through our Drive-Up service, which delivered high single-digit growth on top of more than 80% growth last year.\nAs Brian mentioned, while our overall Q3 comp increase was consistent with Q2, we saw a dramatic change in the pace and composition of our business toward the end of the third quarter. More specifically, within the quarter, comparable sales grew 2.8% in August, rose to 4% in September and decelerated to 0.9% in October. Also notable, even within the October period, there was a dramatic change in the pace of our sales.\nAs you'll recall, the month began with an initial round of holiday promotions from Target and some of our competitors, and in that week, we saw a high single-digit increase in comp sales compared with last year. However, for the remainder of the month, we saw a low single-digit decline in comp sales over those last 3 weeks.\nNearly all of the slowdown was driven by our discretionary categories, Apparel, Home and Hardlines, as our guests became increasingly cautious in their spending in those categories at both Target and throughout the industry more broadly. So far in the month of November, trends have been largely consistent with what we were seeing at the end of October, in terms of our comp trends, the mix of sales between frequency and discretionary businesses and the focus on promotions by our guests.\nWhile our Q3 gross margin rate of 24.7% was more than 3 percentage points higher than in Q2, it came in far short of our expectations, driven by 3 factors. The primary driver was a higher-than-expected markdown impact from promotions as our guests became increasingly price-sensitive and concentrated their discretionary spending on items on promotion, most notably in the latter weeks of the quarter. While we anticipated a highly promotional environment this fall, given the excess inventory we had been seeing across retail, this enhanced focus on promotions reflects an increasing level of stress on consumers as they navigate through multiple headwinds, including persistent inflation and rapidly rising interest rates.\nA second factor that's impacting our gross margin is inventory shortage, or shrink, which is a growing problem facing all retailers. At Target year-to-date, incremental shortage has already reduced our gross margin by more than $400 million versus last year, and we expect it will reduce our gross margin by more than $600 million for the full year.\nAs Brian mentioned, this is an industry-wide problem that is often driven by criminal networks, and we are collaborating with multiple stakeholders to find industry-wide solutions. For example, because stolen goods are often sold online, Target strongly supports the passage of legislation to increase accountability and prevent criminals from selling stolen goods through online marketplaces.\nA third factor that affected our Q3 gross margin was the incremental cost of managing early inventory. In the near term, these pressures should begin to recede as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year as receipt flow naturally moderates following the holiday season and we'll begin to benefit from the reduction in order lead times John mentioned earlier.\nAnd finally, regarding gross margin, category mix moved from being a slight headwind in Q2 to a small tailwind in Q3, contributing about 20 basis points of gross margin benefit in the quarter. This change in mix impact might seem counterintuitive given some of the category trends I highlighted earlier. However, underneath the surface of discretionary comps when compared to our second quarter results, comp sales in Apparel, a high-margin discretionary category got stronger in Q3, while comps in Hardlines, a lower-margin discretionary category saw a deceleration in the third quarter.\nMoving down to the SG&A expense line. We saw a small amount of deleverage in Q3, even as we continue to benefit from disciplined cost management across the organization. In spite of that discipline, we're facing inflationary cost pressures across multiple expense lines in the P&L. Within compensation, expenses reflect ongoing investments in hourly team member pay and benefits, partially offset by a year-over-year rate benefit from lower incentive compensation expense.\nAltogether, on the operating income line, on both a dollar and rate basis, we saw a year-over-year decline of about 50% in the third quarter. I want to emphasize that we're not happy with this performance and expect to deliver much stronger dollar and rate performance over time.\nNow I want to turn to capital deployment. And as always, I'll start by reiterating our priorities, which have been consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and build on our 50-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we devote any excess cash beyond these first 2 uses to repurchase our shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\nBeginning with our first priority, capital expenditures have come in at about $4.3 billion through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we're now expecting our full year CapEx will come in around $5.5 billion in light of continued inflationary pressures affecting the cost of this year's projects. We paid just under $500 million in dividends in the third quarter, up from $440 million a year ago, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in our average share count.\nAnd finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter, given current financial performance and the working capital investments we've made to support in-stocks and early receipts. In the near term, we will continue to take a very cautious approach to share repurchase in light of the volatility of the environment and our commitment to maintaining our middle A credit ratings.\nSo now I want to close my Q3 review with a discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months of the third quarter of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 14.6% compared with 31.3% a year ago. While this is a disappointing decline, a mid-teens after-tax return on capital is still very healthy in absolute terms and a testament to the durability of our business. Importantly, we expect to see a significant recovery from this number over time as we move beyond the unusual headwinds that have been affecting our business this year.\nNow let me turn briefly to our expectations for the fourth quarter. In the current environment, we're facing an even higher degree of uncertainty than a quarter ago given the volatility we've been seeing recently. And in light of the dramatic changes in shopping patterns we've seen both at Target and across the industry, we believe it's prudent to plan for a wide range of comparable sales outcomes in the fourth quarter that's centered around a low single-digit comp decline, consistent with recent trends.\nUnderlying the sales expectation, we're planning for softer discretionary category comps than we've seen in the last 2 quarters, partially offset by the benefit of continued strong growth in our frequency businesses. If these sales trends persist, we'd see far less of a benefit from leverage on fixed expenses than we've seen so far this year.\nIn addition, we'd expect greater markdown pressure from Q4 promotions given the increase in price sensitivity our guests have shown recently and our commitments to end the year with a clean inventory position, especially in those categories where trends have softened. And as I mentioned, we're planning for additional pressure from inventory shrink, given the worsening trends that have emerged so far this year.\nAltogether, these expectations lead to a wide range for our expected Q4 operating margin rate centered around 3%. The single-most sensitive input to this profit projection is the level of demand for our discretionary businesses. If that demand improves from recent trends, we would expect fewer markdowns and would likely outperform our updated profit expectations; while if demand softened further, profit could see additional pressure.\nAs we look beyond the holiday season, we're planning for a continued challenging environment as we move into next year. And as John and Brian already pointed out, we are fortunate to have a durable model that is well positioned to continue serving our guests even in the toughest of times. In addition, we have a significant opportunity to harness efficiencies in support of our long-term growth and profit goals.\nAt the end of 2019, our operations had been built to support a business that delivered $77 billion in sales that year. And our long-term algorithm at the time was anticipating low single-digit top line growth in the years ahead. If things had played out that way, we might be looking at a total sales number in the low to mid-$80 billion range this year. Instead, even in the midst of a very challenging environment, we're positioned to deliver total sales of well over $100 billion this year.\nSo today, we have a compelling opportunity to look across our operations with an eye to simplifying and optimizing those operations for a more than $100 billion business. And today, as we look at the operations we have and where we think they can be, we believe there's a $2 billion to $3 billion savings opportunity over the next 3 years.\nTo be clear, this isn't about slashing resources. And in particular, we're focused on continuing to invest in our team, which is our most valuable asset. As Brian said, we are in the initial stages of scoping this opportunity, and we expect to share detail on our progress at our 2023 Financial Community Meeting. In the meantime, I want to join Brian and wishing all of you a happy holiday season, and I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for making Target a great place to work and a store that's ready to bring joy to millions of our guests throughout this season and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nBefore we turn to your questions, I want to relay a few thoughts that I shared with our Target team earlier today. While the circumstances we're facing are difficult and certainly not what anyone would wish for, we need to embrace the moment, focus on what we can control and lean into our strengths. Because even as we face multiple challenges, all at the same time, we have an even longer list of strengths on our side. And there are quite a few headwinds, but we've shown time and time again that our strengths can overcome any challenge we face.\nWe have nearly 2,000 well-located, well-maintained store locations. We have a rapidly growing set of owned brands that are already generating more than $30 billion in annual sales. And we have a unique and growing list of national brand partners, including Starbucks, CVS Health, Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty.\nOur unmatched product design, development and sourcing capabilities allow us to offer an unbeatable combination of price, quality, design and fashion throughout our own brand portfolio. We have a durable operating model and a balanced portfolio of merchandise categories, which allow us to pivot quickly in a rapidly changing environment.\nOur operations are profitable, generate robust cash flow and are backed by a strong balance sheet that enables continued investment during lean times. And of course, we have a unique, amazing, passionate team that has only grown stronger over the last few years. So this morning, I've asked our team to focus on what they do best, moving with agility and responding to the environment in real time, delivering outstanding execution throughout the holiday season and beyond and doing it all as one team, aligned in support of our guests and each other.\nWhile we'd all prefer to be operating in a more robust environment, today, we have the opportunity and all the resources we need to continue playing offense while many others cannot. By harnessing the strength of our assets and our amazing team I'm confident we'll continue to grow guest engagement and deliver compelling growth on both the top and bottom line over time.\nWith that, we can move to Q&A. Now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to Target Corporation's second quarter earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 17, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of IR, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call.\nOn the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our second quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.\nThis morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.\nAnd finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his perspective on the back half of the year. Brian?\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Back in June, we announced that our team would be undertaking a bold effort to rightsize our inventory position in the categories through which demand patterns have rapidly changed.\nWhile this decision had a meaningful short-term impact on our financial results, we strongly believe it was the best path forward. Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly, over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact, it would have held back our business over time. Of course, this decision would have driven incremental costs to store and manage the excess inventory over a longer period. But much more importantly, it would have degraded the guest experience. It would have cluttered our sales floor and hampered our ability to present new, fresh and fashionable items, the ones our guests expect from Target.\nJust as importantly, the extra inventory would have presented an ongoing burden to our supply chain and store teams, as they face the distraction of working around it day after day. Instead of taking that passive position, our team chose a more decisive path, aggressively reducing the inventory we already owned and cutting back on receipts for the back half of the year. And today, with those decisions behind us, we're in a much better position as we head into the fall season.\nAs you'll hear in more detail, we've meaningfully reduced our ownership and commitments in categories where we've seen softening demand. This has allowed us to strengthen our inventory position and in-stock position in the categories that are driving our growth, most notably in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials.\nRegarding the financial impact of those decisions, Michael will provide more details in a few minutes. But the high-level story is, the vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us. This positions our business to deliver a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season. However, beyond financial and operational outcomes, I'm focused on how our inventory actions will benefit our guests and our team. Regarding our guests, we're now positioned to continue driving engagement and growing traffic with a clean, safe and uncluttered store experience and an assortment that highlights newness and supports growth. For our team, this quarter's inventory actions will enable them to focus on doing what they do best: providing a great guest experience while reducing the stress and distraction from overly crowded store backrooms and distribution facilities.\nAfter we announced the rightsizing effort at the beginning of June, I have heard from countless leaders across the company, who wanted to relay their gratitude for the decision to move quickly and face the issue head-on.\nIn the same spirit, I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of the entire Target team during a very challenging time for the economy, for our industry and our business. Our success in reducing inventory was a result of unprecedented effort, coordination and collaboration across multiple teams, from our U.S. headquarters to our Target India headquarters, to our stores, distribution centers, transportation team and sourcing offices around the world. And today, in the face of a very challenging backdrop, I'm proud of how our team and business model continue to serve our guests' evolving needs. Everything we do, from the design of our operating model to the way we train our team, is done with a focus on better serving our guests.\nIt's reflected in how we choose our assortment, where we curate a broad range of items, both in-store and online, from the stylish to the functional, incorporating quality and value throughout. It's also evident in how we design our store and the digital shopping experience that make them easy, convenient and inspirational, inviting guests to choose the right option every time they shop. All of these decisions make our business model more durable, allowing us to drive deeper guest engagement and grow traffic in every environment.\nConsistent with the shopping trends we've seen for more than a year, our second quarter comp increase of 2.6% was driven entirely by traffic, which expanded 2.7% this year, on top of double-digit growth a year ago. With this increase, second quarter traffic has expanded by well over 20% since 2019. In raw numbers, that means in the second quarter alone, we've added more than 90 million guest visits over the last 3 years.\nThese visits are a vivid demonstration of a deepening level of guest engagement resulting from multiple investments throughout our business. These investments include dozens of new stores and hundreds of remodels every year. They also include investments in our industry-leading same-day services, which have transformed our business in a short time. More specifically, 3 years ago, in the second quarter of 2019, digital fulfillment accounted for just over 7% of total sales. In contrast, by the second quarter of this year, the same-day portion of our digital sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. This drove our total digital penetration up to almost 18%, more than doubling in only 3 years.\nBeyond our stores and fulfillment services, guests continue to respond to our investments in our own brand portfolio. This portfolio delivers more than $30 billion in annual sales, and includes 12 brands that generate more than $1 billion each. At the same time, we're investing in new spaces and presentation for key national brand partners like Apple, Disney and Levi's. And of course, we've been rapidly expanding the number of stores that feature an Ulta Beauty at Target given the incremental traffic and sales they deliver. But nothing has been more important than the investments we've made in our team. These investments include the move to a starting hourly wage range of $15 to $24 across the country, enhanced health care and wellness benefits for a larger percentage of our team, the rollout of an industry-leading debt-free college educational plan and our work to enhance the growth and development opportunities available to all of our team members, and the team members of color in particular.\nAs we look ahead to the back half of the year, the team is laser-focused on delivering convenience, value and joy at a time when our guests are facing multiple challenges. And while we've taken a cautious stance on our inventory commitments, we'll continue to lean into frequency categories where guest demand has been strong and where the markdown risks are very low.\nIn addition, given the ongoing pressure our guests are facing from inflation, we're leaning into value. This means we're focused on providing great everyday pricing and strong opening price points across every category, including in our own brands. At the same time, we hear from our guests that they're focused on celebrating the seasonal moments they missed over the last 2 years. As a result, we'll lean into those seasonal moments, helping our guests find ways to come together and celebrate with family and friends.\nSo we still have a lot of business ahead of us. We've seen an encouraging start to the back-to-school and back-to-college season, and our teams are already deep into their planning for the upcoming Halloween season, a time when we expect our guests will fully embrace trick-or-treating and scheduling parties to celebrate with family, friends and neighbors.\nGiven continued volatility in the external environment, we built our fall plans with a priority on flexibility and agility, and that's where our business model shines. More specifically, our multi-category portfolio stays relevant and drives trips across a wide range of wants and needs.\nIn today's environment, that means our Food & Beverage category is front and center, having grown more than 50%, or $1.8 billion since the second quarter of 2019. But regardless of whether a Target Run begins with a need for an item in food and beverage or household essentials, to see what's new in our beauty assortment, to pick up a toy for a birthday party or a piece of luggage for an upcoming trip, our safe one-stop shopping experience provides an opportunity to sell items in every one of our categories on every guest visit.\nBeyond our assortment, our unique stores-as-hubs operating model offers unmatched flexibility in how we can fulfill guest demand. Whether a guest wants to make a conventional in-store shopping trip, place a drive-up order, arrange a Shipt delivery or simply have a box delivered to their front door, stores can fulfill every one of those needs quickly and reliably, allowing our guests to choose what works best for them in that moment.\nAnd as Michael will outline in more detail, our strong balance sheet and robust cash generation support continued investments during tough times like these, investments in our long-term growth and market share.\nAt a time when many others will be struggling just to survive, the ability to play offense and focus on the long term makes us well positioned to emerge from the current downturn even stronger than before.\nSo as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank our team for their continued passion for serving our guests and each other. While the environment remains challenging, I'm inspired by the new and unique merchandise, seasonal offerings and partnerships our team has planned for the back half of the year. And as I've traveled across the country to visit our stores and distribution centers, I've been inspired to hear how our team is energized and eager to serve our guests with energy, empathy and care, bringing some daily joy at a time when our guests are dealing with multiple headwinds. This unshakable guest focus is one of the many reasons our unique team makes Target a great company, and I am privileged and grateful to serve with them.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Christina.\n\nA. Christina Hennington\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the tough environment we are facing today, I continue to be pleased with both our top line performance and the underlying market share we're seeing across our business: namely, across all 5 of our core merchandising categories. We saw unit share gains in the second quarter, providing clear evidence that our guests are finding more and more ways to satisfy their wants and needs with every Target Run.\nAs Brian mentioned earlier, the inventory actions we announced in June involved incredible collaboration across teams at headquarters, stores and throughout our supply chain network. And I'm proud to say that together as one team, we accomplished what we set out to do. By moving through excess units, we were able to realign our broader inventory portfolio to those categories our guests are most focused on, including frequency categories like Food & Beverage, Everyday Essentials and Beauty as well as all things new, seasonal and fashion-forward.\nTo accomplish that goal, teams analyzed and built action plans to aggressively work through excess inventory at every point along the product journey, from vendor to guests. This included rigorously reforecasting expectations for the balance of the year and beyond and determining where to reduce future receipts and orders. In some cases, that meant working with vendor partners to reduce our fall receipts in light of our updated expectations. It also meant quickly building compelling promotional plans to drive unit velocity for product we already owned, all with a focus on providing great value and generating excitement for our guests. And throughout the execution of these action plans, our teams remain steadfast in their guests-first focus, refusing to compromise the shopping experience in our stores or online.\nAs you heard from Brian, the short-term profit implications of these decisions were meaningful, but we're confident they're the right long-term decisions for our business, for our teams and for our guests. As we formed and revisited our plans for the third quarter and beyond, we spent a lot of time listening to the wants, needs, hopes and concerns of our guests. What we're seeing in our results and hearing from our guests is that they still have spending power, but they're increasingly feeling the impact of inflation. And while the recent reduction in prices at the gas pump has been encouraging, guest confidence in their personal finances continues to wane.\nAgainst that backdrop, we've seen our guests shop our owned brands in bigger ways and more frequently, knowing they are choosing great quality products with incredible value. We've also seen guest behavior evolve as they focus on optimizing their personal budgets through a heightened response to promotions as well as greater trip consolidation.\nAt the same time, guests continue to experience difficult news headlines, COVID surges and continued political volatility, leading them to seek more ways to celebrate, connect and find opportunities to bring joy to their families. This is one of the reasons we continue to see such strength in our seasonal categories, which we expect will continue in the back half of the year.\nNow let me turn to some of the category highlights from the second quarter, in which overall comparable sales grew 2.6%, on top of 8.9% a year ago, reflecting continued strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials.\nFood & Beverage led the way in the quarter with growth in the low double digits, reflecting broad strength across multiple subcategories. Beauty grew in the high single digits, reflecting notable strength in Ulta Beauty at Target, along with the skincare and bath categories. Essentials grew in the mid-single digits with performance led by pets and health care. Overall, across our discretionary categories, sales were softer than a year ago, but remained nearly $3.5 billion or more than 35% higher than the second quarter of 2019.\nIn Hardlines, overall comp sales were down slightly to last year. Within Hardlines, softness in electronics was partially offset by strength in entertainment, which grew in the high single digits, along with high single-digit comp growth in toys, an encouraging sign as we plan for the fourth quarter holiday season.\nOverall, the Home category saw a low single-digit decline compared to last year despite affinity for our seasonal assortments and encouraging early results in back-to-school and back-to-college.\nApparel also saw a low single-digit decline in the second quarter but saw meaningful growth in women's fashion-forward categories, along with performance apparel, on top of strong sales growth in the category over the past 2 years.\nAs I mentioned earlier, while overall sales growth is one key indicator of the health of our business, market share is an equally important measure that we use to understand how we're performing. And notably, during inflationary times like these, we heavily focus on unit share, specifically to better understand our relevance as compared to our competitive set, given that growth in both traffic and units is a strong proxy for the guests' overall engagement with Target. Time and time again, these metrics have proven to be a better barometer for lasting success as compared to growth solely through average retail prices. That's why I'm so encouraged that across all 5 of our core merchandising categories, we grew unit share in the second quarter.\nSo now let's turn our sights to all that is to come for the balance of the fiscal year. Having celebrated holidays in a big way in the second quarter, guests already have their sights set on upcoming holidays and seasonal moments in Q3 and beyond. Preparing for the upcoming school year is top of mind for families right now. And to help with the transition, we're providing budget-friendly options for students, parents and teachers alike. Beyond our assortment of value-priced owned brands and leading national brands, we're offering a onetime 20% off Target Circle deal for college students to get those dorm rooms prepped and ready. And we've also extended our teacher prep event to nearly 8 weeks of discounts on supplies and more.\nAnd today, while we still have several weeks of the season left to go, we've been encouraged by early results in both our back-to-school and back-to-college programs. Shortly after school begins, we'll turn our attention to celebrating Latino Heritage Month, which begins in the middle of September. We're excited to help celebrate this important cultural moment with our guests through the presentation of a compelling assortment, 99% of which was created by members of the Hispanic/Latino community. Then before we know it, Halloween celebrations will be underway, with all the tricks and treats the season has to offer. Our guest research indicates that more families plan to participate in Halloween festivities compared with last year, and we're ready with a wide array of gender and size inclusive costumes, new owned brand trick-or-treating candy and accessories, haunted house cookie building sets and so much more.\nAnd for those that want to celebrate the broader fall and harvest season in general, rest assured that there will be no shortage of new offerings from Good & Gather to create perfect meal, snacking and entertaining solutions, including delicious new flavors of the season like maple, cinnamon, apple and, of course, all things pumpkin spice.\nOutside of specific holidays, we are focused on helping our guests experience Everyday Joy, and our ability to cut across brands and categories is part of what makes us uniquely Target. For an example, look no further than our upcoming collaboration this fall with Marvel to bring a unique assortment to our guests across the Avengers and Spider-Man franchises. One standout will be lots of Marvel Studios' Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Black Panther Legacy exclusives within toys, Apparel, Home and more. We'll have more details to share in the coming months.\nAnd in an exciting collaboration with long-time partner, The LEGO Group, we are bringing their popular LEGO Ideas contest to Target, in which LEGO superfans submit ideas for a themed LEGO building set. After a public submission phase, a handful of finalists will be selected for guests and fans to choose their favorite idea to be produced as an exclusive set at Target and LEGO brand retail stores.\nBut Target Joy goes well beyond key holidays or exclusive launches. It's about how we continue to iterate and improve upon what our guests already know and love from their regular Target Run. This next quarter, you'll see us elevate our fashion assortment with several new collections and updated brands. We'll introduce new well-known national brands in cookware and kitchen. We'll also continue to expand our leading national brand partnerships, including opening more Disney stores and, of course, Ulta Beauty at Target.\nIn fact, we're only a year into this new partnership, and there's plenty of room to grow ahead. With the introduction of new designer fragrance brands, including Coach, Clinique, Kate Spade and more as well as additional skin and hair care products, we continue to evolve the assortment to bring more joy to our Beauty guests. We remain on track to open at least 250 of these unique spaces this year. Plus, we've already seen more than 1.5 million guests link their Target Circle and Ultamate Rewards accounts, a number that's sure to continue to grow in the months and years ahead.\nSo now before I pass things over to John, I'd like to take a moment and echo Brian's gratitude for the team. While we have demonstrated time and time again that our durable, flexible model can quickly pivot with changing consumer demands and a host of retail and economic conditions, none of that can happen without an incredible team. Their talent, dedication, passion and expertise allows us to continue putting the Target guests at the center of every decision we make. As a result, we continue to benefit from deeper guest loyalty and preference for our brand.\nI have been at Target 19 years, and I continue to be inspired every day by the talent around me. Thank you for your commitment and care to all our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll pass things over to John.\n\nJohn J. Mulligan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina. In past calls, I've described how our operations team is always focused on two things at the same time. Of course, they're always focused on short-term execution and problem-solving to ensure we provide a convenient, consistent and inspiring experience for our guests. In addition, our team works every day to deliver on our long-term vision and aspirations, ensuring our operations are ready to support our future plans. While this dual focus on both near-term and long-term priorities has always been present, it's been especially notable this year, given that we've been operating in a very unique environment.\nIn terms of the short term, and as Brian and Christina mentioned earlier, our work to quickly rightsize inventory required determination, commitment and coordination between multiple teams across the company. And given the need to protect the guest experience, there was no higher priority than delivering against this near-term plan. At the same time, our team remains passionately focused on the long-term investments we're making in our future. These investments include our work to modernize and expand our store footprint, increase upstream capacity in our supply chain, automate distribution center processes to reduce store workload and enhance our last-mile fulfillment capabilities by opening sortation centers and integrating them into our Shipt network. And fortunately, as Brian highlighted, the strength of our business allows us to continue funding these long-term investments even in the face of the challenging external backdrop we're facing today.\nI want to first turn to our work on inventory. And I'm happy to report that our team has made remarkable progress over the last few months, causing conditions in our supply chain to improve significantly. More specifically, and to provide some helpful context, over time, we want to keep our DC network operating at or below 85% of its maximum capacity, given that operational difficulties and costs rise significantly when we move beyond that level. So it's important to note that back in June, inventory in our DC network peaked at well over 90% of our capacity. Also notable, by the end of the second quarter, less than 2 months later, our team had quickly reduced DC capacity utilization to below 80%.\nPut another way, by the end of the second quarter, the physical space occupied by our distribution center inventory was more than 20% lower than the peak we reached in June. So today, while we still have some individual sites where we need to make more progress, the team has accomplished a remarkable improvement in a very short time, which will allow our end-to-end operations to function more efficiently and effectively in the back half of the year.\nAs Christina mentioned, beyond addressing the inventory we already owned, the team also took a hard look at sales trends and determined ideal inventory levels across every category for the remainder of the year. As a result, we've meaningfully reduced our fall season receipt commitments in many discretionary categories. With these reductions, we're projecting our DCs will remain at or below 85% capacity through the remainder of the year, even after the seasonal increase in holiday inventory that is set to occur over the next 2 months. In other words, for the first time I am aware of, our fall season inventory is projected to peak at a lower level than in spring, providing another vivid illustration of the unique dynamics we've encountered so far this year.\nWhile this inventory rightsizing process hasn't been easy and our teams have devoted an amazing amount of effort in a small amount of time, this work has allowed our teams to strengthen ongoing communication mechanisms and build new processes. Going forward, these improvements will enable our merchandising and supply chain teams to maintain enhanced real-time communication, particularly with respect to categories where we face the highest inventory risk, allowing us to respond to changes with more speed and agility.\nWhile pressure from excess inventory has presented the biggest challenge to our team this year, dealing with high costs and volatility in the external supply chain has run a close second. And today, while conditions remain far from what we would have considered normal in the years before the pandemic, there are early signs that both costs and volatility may have peaked. More specifically, lead times in global shipping have begun to decline. Spot rates to move shipping containers have fallen somewhat. And in light of the reduction in petroleum prices we've all seen recently, fuel surcharges have been easing somewhat compared with the peak rates we saw earlier in the second quarter.\nThat said, conditions remain highly unfavorable when compared to the years before the pandemic, and we're mindful of the continued risks in the months ahead, including potential slowdowns at the West Coast ports, a reversal of the recent decline in energy costs and the possibility of additional COVID lockdowns in China.\nIn addition, we continue to encounter far too many delays affecting overseas shipping which require us to pay spot rates to move containers, rates that are well above our prenegotiated shipping rates. As such, we're maintaining our practice of moving receipt dates earlier than we would have in the past, which allows us to mitigate the business risk from receiving shipments later than expected.\nYou'll recall that at this time a year ago, when the external supply chain began slowing down and shipments were arriving late, we began relying on air freight much more than usual to ensure we received key seasonal merchandise on time for the holiday season. While that was the right decision at the time given the circumstances we were facing, this year, we expect to meaningfully reduce our reliance on air freight by moving to early receipt dates for seasonal inventory. To accommodate these early receipts without adding further color to our supply chain in stores, we secured temporary capacity to store and stage shipping containers near the ports where we receive them. When needed, this allows us to quickly clear the containers from the port area and hold them until the ideal time to begin moving inventory into our supply chain network. While we don't expect to need this additional capacity over the long term, we believe it's clearly the most efficient approach in today's environment, given the volatility we continue to face.\nI also want to highlight the critical role that our stores have played in our work to improve conditions in our supply chain. During the second quarter, our store teams engaged in a host of activities to support the effort, including the execution of countless promotions and markdown programs to move the excess merchandise quickly and the development of innovative presentation strategies to highlight the deals we were offering our guests. This included repurposing the seasonal presentation space in our stores to highlight deals and create meaningful statements, including key item promotions. It also included the early wind down of our outdoor living assortment, which allowed us to bring in our back-to-school set earlier than usual, ensuring we are back in stock and reliable on key items parents needed to fill their back-to-school shopping list.\nMore specifically, at the end of the second quarter, about 3/4 of our back-to-school and back-to-college receipts were already downstream in our stores, a number that was closer to 50% at the end of Q2 a year ago.\nSo now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to turn my focus to our longer-term priorities and the multiple ways we're investing in our future growth. As you know, the majority of our CapEx is going into our store network, both to extend our footprint and invest in existing locations. These store investments fall into 3 major buckets. The first and largest investment is in our store remodel program, where we completely transform the space in an existing location, modernizing the shopping experience while enhancing the productivity of our team. At this point in the year, well over 100 remodels are currently in flight across the country, keeping us on track to complete nearly 200 remodels this year.\nIn addition to these complete transformations, we're also making smaller investments in hundreds of other locations. This includes the hundreds of fulfillment remodels we'll accomplish this year, in which we reconfigure portions of the store to enhance the efficiency, safety and capacity of our drive-up, in-store pickup and ship-from-store services. In addition, this year, we're investing in several hundred locations to add an Ulta Beauty at Target, a co-branded Apple shopping space or a Disney store presentation to the sales floor. And finally, we're on track to add about 24 new store locations in 2022. So far this year, we've opened 12 new locations across the country, in neighborhoods as diverse as SoHo in New York and Jackson Hole in Wyoming.\nBeyond this work in stores, we're also making significant investments in our supply chain focused on 3 main priorities. The first is to build additional upstream capacity to our network, given that we continue to grow sales on top of the $27 billion we added in 2020 and 2021. In support of this goal, we opened 2 upstream DCs near the end of 2021 and plan to open 6 new upstream facilities over the next several years, including 2 on track to open in 2023.\nIn addition to the space we're adding to the network, we're continuing to modernize how our existing distribution centers serve our stores by developing and automating processes that reduce the amount of store workload devoted to receiving inventory and restocking store sales floors. And finally, we're rapidly expanding the number of sortation centers operating around the country. We have 6 of these facilities operating today, including 3 that have opened in the last few months, and we have plans to add 5 more by early next year. These small facilities expand ship-from-store capacity in the locations they serve while significantly reducing last-mile delivery costs, particularly as we integrate our Shipt drivers into the process.\nGiven the package delivery density we've achieved across many markets over the last few years, we see continued opportunities to add more sortation centers over the next few years, which adds speed and significantly reduce last-mile costs in markets where they operate.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, this year's capital projects are being impacted by the cost increases, material shortages and supply chain pressures that are affecting other parts of our business. And I'm really proud of how our construction team is managing through these headwinds. More specifically, while cost increases are raising the cost of many of these projects, the team has done an excellent job in keeping the vast majority of projects on track and on time despite the significant headwinds they are facing.\nSo as I conclude my remarks, I have to pause and add my thanks to the entire team for their resilience and perseverance during a period of incredibly rapid change, which caused this quarter to be as challenging as any I've seen in my career. In the face of that challenge, what's been amazing is how our team members have stayed positive, how they've worked to find collaborative solutions across multiple teams and never strayed from their commitment to our guests and our company purpose. With the progress they have made, our operations are now in much better shape, and the team is energized and ready to play offense in the back half of the year.\nWhile we are all mindful of the near-term volatility in the environment, it's times like these that often present the biggest opportunity to gain long-term market share as others face the distraction of trying to stay afloat while we continue to invest and improve our operations. That's one of many reasons that I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in the years ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Thanks, John. As John mentioned, we often ask our team to be mindful of both short-term and long-term considerations when making decisions. And given the unique circumstances we've been facing, this quarter, we faced a decision with meaningful implications for both. As Brian outlined earlier, if we had decided not to deal with our excess inventory head-on, we could have avoided some short-term pain on the profit line, but that would have hampered our longer-term potential. Instead, because of the path we took, our quarterly profit took a meaningful step-down, but our future path is brighter. Our operations are healthy, our store and DC teams have more flexibility to maneuver and we're ready to feature both the fresh assortment and uncluttered shopping experience our guests expect and deserve. That passionate commitment to the guest experience is one of the many reasons we've now seen 21 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth.\nWhile normally our income statement gets the most attention, I want to start my remarks today with the balance sheet and specifically, our inventory position. And as I dig into the detail, I want to acknowledge upfront that this kind of analysis is a relatively complex exercise because of the growth and volatility we've experienced over the last couple of years, because of the broad and diverse assortment that we sell and the fact that our business is seasonal from quarter-to-quarter.\nMore specifically, given that our inventory position throughout the pandemic was far from optimal, focusing on year-over-year growth numbers isn't very helpful right now. As a result, we often base our inventory analysis on growth trends compared with 2019, a pre-pandemic year when our inventory and sales trends were much more in sync.\nWith that as context, I want to zero in on one of the questions I'm sure you have, which is why our inventory on the balance sheet remained roughly constant at around $15 billion between the first and second quarters. The simple answer is that while that single number didn't change much, we accomplished exactly what we intended to do during the quarter, which helped change conditions significantly below the surface.\nMore specifically, because of the inventory actions we executed, unit growth compared with 2019 in our discretionary categories decelerated by more than 15 percentage points between the first and second quarter, a change we estimate would have reduced our inventory position by more than $1 billion if taken in isolation.\nHowever, a couple of offsetting changes moved our quarter-end inventory in the other direction. First among them, we leaned into our frequency categories during the quarter, accelerating 3-year unit growth versus Q1 at a double-digit rate, resulting in stronger in-stock metrics compared with 90 days ago. Another factor that drove inventory dollars higher is the continued increase in unit costs we've been seeing across all of our categories, which caused the dollar value of our inventory to grow faster than unit growth in the second quarter.\nSo where do we stand today? At the end of the second quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was about $6 billion higher than we reported 3 years ago. Of that dollar growth, about $3 billion or approximately half of that total growth is the result of higher unit costs across our assortment. Of the remaining $3 billion, our analysis indicates another $1 billion to $2 billion is related to our decision to move receipt timing earlier, given the volatility we continue to expect in the supply chain. And also importantly, beyond reshaping the inventory we already have, our Q2 inventory actions also included the removal of more than $1.5 billion of fall receipts in our discretionary categories, reflecting our continued focus on reducing risk in the current environment. That's why we feel good about our inventory position as we head into the back half of the year.\nSo now I'll turn to a review of our second quarter financial results. Total sales increased 3.3% in the quarter, driven by a 2.6% increase in comparable sales, combined with the impact of new stores. Total revenue increased 3.5%, reflecting sales growth along with the benefit of nearly 15% growth on the other revenue line, driven by continued strength in our Roundel ad business.\nJust as Christina pointed out, that unit share is a key measure of Target's relevance versus competitors, traffic growth is another important indicator of the relevance of our brand. Our continued traffic growth in the second quarter clearly demonstrates the ability of our balanced multi-category assortment to deliver continued relevance in a rapidly changing environment like we're seeing today. So that even as our guests' preference for individual categories has been changing dramatically so far this year, that hasn't affected their preference for Target. As a result, traffic accounted for 100% of our comparable sales growth in the second quarter, increasing 2.7%, on top of 12.7% a year ago. Average ticket remained essentially flat in the quarter, as low single-digit increase in average retail was offset by a similar reduction in the number of items per transaction.\nAcross our sales channels, store comps grew 1.3%, on top of 8.7% a year ago, while digital comps grew 9%, on top of 9.9% last year. Digital growth continues to be led by our same-day services, which saw double-digit growth overall and mid-teens growth in drive-up.\nOn the gross margin line, we saw a nearly 9 percentage point decline compared with last year. Merchandising accounted for more than 7 points of this pressure, driven primarily by our inventory reduction efforts, along with the impact of higher fuel and transportation costs, product cost increases and higher shrink, partially offset by the benefit of retail price increases.\nIn addition, digital fulfillment and supply chain drove about 1.5 points of pressure, reflecting increased compensation and headcount in our distribution centers, combined with the cost of managing excess inventory and higher last-mile shipping costs. Consistent with the first quarter, mix accounted for approximately 10 basis points of pressure. The softness in higher-margin categories like Apparel and Home was largely offset by softness in lower-margin discretionary categories, most notably electronics.\nOn the SG&A line, we continue to benefit from fixed cost leverage and efficiency gains across our operations, which helped to offset the impact of cost inflation across multiple expense lines. Within overall compensation, lower incentive compensation more than offset continued investments in pay and benefits for our hourly team members.\nAltogether, our second quarter operating margin rate was 1.2%, down from an unusually high 9.8% a year ago, driven entirely by the decline in our gross margin rate. This operating margin performance was below the midpoint of our most recent guidance, as the cost of our inventory actions was somewhat higher than expected.\nWhile an operating margin rate of just over 1% is well below anything I've seen in my career and something I never expect to see again, I have no doubt that it was the right outcome given the unusual circumstances we've been facing this year. Our focus throughout the second quarter was to ensure that we took care of the excess inventory of our network and adjust future receipts to reflect the rapid change in sales trends we've seen so far this year. We accomplished this goal to the benefit of our operations, our team and our guests.\nFinally, one note on our tax rate. In a period like this year, when our operating profit is unusually low, tax benefits have a larger-than-normal impact on our tax rate, which helps to explain why our year-to-date tax rate has been lower than expected. Looking forward, given that we anticipate a meaningful improvement in our operating performance in the back half of the year, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate will be in a range around 21%.\nNow I'm going to turn to capital deployment and begin where I always do by articulating our priorities, which we've supported consistently for decades. Our first priority is always to invest fully in our business, in projects that support our strategic and financial criteria. Once we've met this first priority, we support our dividend and look to extend our 50-year record of annual increases. And finally, once we've supported the first 2 priorities, we return any remaining excess cash by repurchasing our shares over time, within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\nRegarding the first priority, second quarter CapEx was approximately $1.5 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to just over $2.5 billion. As you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, we guided to an expected full year CapEx range of $4 billion to $5 billion. And at the time, I indicated my hope that we'd reach the high end of that range, with the outcome depending on how many capital projects could stay on schedule.\nSo I'm happy that, as John mentioned, the team is doing a great job of keeping projects on track despite facing multiple headwinds, all while inflation in the cost of equipment, materials and labor is driving project spending above initial projections. As such, we now expect our full year CapEx will be $5 billion or more for the year, reflecting both the number of projects that remain on track and the expected impact of cost inflation.\nOf course, while we prefer not to face the cost pressure on these projects, I'm encouraged that so many value-creating projects remain on track to be completed this year, projects that will benefit our operations and our P&L for years to come.\nTurning to our second capital deployment priority. We returned $417 million in dividends to our shareholders in the second quarter, up from $336 million a year ago, driven by a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in average share count.\nAnd finally, in June, we reached the final settlement for the accelerated share repurchase agreement we initiated last March. Under this ASR, we invested $2.6 billion to retire 12.5 million shares of our stock. Looking forward, just as our inventory commitments reflect continued caution for the remainder of the year, we're taking a similar cautious stance in terms of our share repurchase activity. And of course, any repurchase activity will be consistent with our long-term goal to maintain our middle A credit ratings.\nSo now I want to close my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures both our near-term profitability and the efficiency of our CapEx decisions over time. In the second quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 18.4% compared with 31.7% a year ago. And it's notable, while the current number is well below where we expect to operate over time, an after-tax number in the high teens would have been considered aspirational for our business only a few years ago. So for us to temporarily move down to this level in an environment as challenging as we're facing is a vivid confirmation of the underlying strength and resilience of our business model, and the reason we continue to be incredibly optimistic about our future prospects.\nAnd that confidence starts and ends with our team, so I want to pause and express my gratitude to the best team in retail. Without your efforts, we couldn't have achieved the remarkable growth in traffic and sales that we've seen over the last few years and why even in a tough year, our business remains strong.\nNow let's turn to our guidance. And based on the hard work of our team in the second quarter, we feel really good about how we're positioned going into the back half of the year. At the same time, given that we've been experiencing volatile economic conditions so far this year and that volatility appears likely to continue in the months ahead, we're maintaining a cautious stance as we plan our business given the potential macro and consumer risks that might emerge. That's why, as you've heard throughout our remarks today, our second quarter inventory actions were specifically designed to reduce our level of risk in discretionary categories. And in terms of our operations, the team has focused on building flexibility into our plans, placing a premium on staying nimble and adjusting quickly in the face of any potential change in macro trends.\nRegarding the top line, our expectations have remained consistent so far this year, with guidance for full year total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. With the front half of the year behind us, both our Q1 and Q2 results have put us squarely in the middle of that range. And today, based on our current performance and plans for the back half of the year, we remain positioned to deliver full year revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range.\nOn the operating margin line, our most recent guidance anticipated a fall season operating margin rate and a range centered around 6%. This expectation is nearly double our spring result. And notably, if we hit that rate in the fall, it would exceed the fall season rates we were delivering prior to the pandemic. And today, similar to my commentary on the top line, based on the success of our Q2 inventory actions and our current performance, we remain positioned to deliver an operating margin rate in a range around 6% in the fall season.\nBetween the last 2 quarters of the year, we expect our third quarter rate will be well below our Q3 performance over the last couple of years, while our fourth quarter rate should be much more in line with our recent Q4 experience. Most notably, in the third quarter, we'll continue to experience some spillover impact from our inventory actions in the range of $200 million. In contrast, in Q4, we'll be annualizing meaningful cost headwinds that surfaced a year ago, which will make the year-over-year comparison more favorable despite the current headwinds we're facing.\nAll that said, while we typically anticipate something closer to a balance of upside and downside potential when we make any forecast, the macro and consumer risks in the back half of this year feel skewed to the downside. That's why even in the face of consistent business trends in recent months, we've undertaken the significant cost and effort to remove risk from our inventory commitments. It's why we're stubbornly focused on real-time monitoring and communication of evolving conditions, and why we've asked our team to build flexibility and agility into their plans. With that mindset, if trends move away from what we're seeing today, we're ready to quickly adjust.\nSo now before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to emphasize why we're so confident in our long-term potential, even as we navigate a very challenging environment in a year of multiple challenges, including rapidly changing consumer preferences, inflation at 40-year highs, volatile supply chain conditions and rising fuel and transportation rates that are expected to add well over $1 billion of cost this year. Our business continues to generate historically strong traffic increases, low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and unit share gains across all of our core merchandising categories.\nAnd even in the face of unprecedented profit rate pressure driven by the host of factors I just listed, we remain profitable with an after-tax ROIC in the mid-teens. In fact, if our performance in the fall is consistent with the revenue growth and operating margin rates I outlined earlier, we remain positioned in 2022 to generate higher operating margin dollars than we did in 2019. That's what we mean when we say we have built a durable model.\nAnd today, while we expect conditions to remain challenging in the near term, the operating margin rate improvement we're projecting in the back half of the year should serve as an early indicator of the continued rate improvement we should deliver in the years ahead. With the potential for additional rate expansion and continued growth in traffic and revenue in the years ahead, we're facing a compelling financial picture as the economy and consumer eventually recover. That's why I've never been more confident in our long-term prospects than I am today.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Michael. I often tell my team that leadership and performance are tightly linked over time, but that leadership often appears first. That's why I'm extremely proud of the leadership our team showed in the second quarter. After they took a hard look at our owned inventory position and the amount that was building up across our industry, they opted to make the hard choice: get in front of the problem and address it head-on.\nThey made that decision with the full knowledge it would have a profound impact on our near-term profitability. They also knew there was another path. We could have avoided attacking the problem and avoid some of the pain in the short run. But instead, our team chose to lead. They knew the best path for our guests and for our teams in our stores and distribution centers was to take action and improve the condition of our inventory and operations quickly. That path would allow the entire Target team to move ahead without facing the ongoing burden of excess inventory holding us back.\nSo the team quickly developed the bolder plan, which we announced in early June, just over 2 months ago. And in the intervening weeks, teams across the company worked tirelessly to take the plan and make it a reality. That's the reason we're positioned to deliver a strong improvement in our profitability this fall despite an environment that's far from ideal. Because of our team's leadership, our business today is much better positioned to perform, and I couldn't be more proud and grateful for the courage they have shown.\nSo with that, I want to thank you for listening into our call today. And now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 18, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Hulbert\n\nVP of IR, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call.\nOn the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our first quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the second quarter and beyond. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.\nThis morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.\nAnd finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his perspective on our outlook. Brian?\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the underlying strength of the relationship we've built with our guests at a time when our team is working through multiple cost pressures affecting our business. As expected, our business continued to grow in the first quarter, on top of huge gains a year ago, underlying the resilience of both the consumer and the ability of our team to serve them. However, due to a host of factors, this growth was challenged by unusually high costs, resulting in profitability well below what we expected to be and where we expect to operate over time.\nFirst quarter comparable sales grew by 3.3%, on top of 23% growth a year ago. This marked our 20th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases. 11 of those quarters were before the pandemic, followed by the rapid acceleration we saw in 2020. We're also encouraged that traffic continues to fuel our growth, increasing nearly 4% in the quarter, on top of 17% growth a year ago.\nOur first quarter gross margin rate was well below our expectations, reflecting a combination of factors that prove to be very different than expected, driven by a rapidly shifting macro backdrop and changing consumer behavior. More specifically, we saw much higher-than-expected freight and transportation costs and a more dramatic change in our sales mix than we anticipated. This resulted in excess inventory, much of it in bulky categories, which put additional strain on an already stretched supply chain. Christina, John and Michael will share more details shortly.\nAnd while we have a lot of work ahead of us to restore profitability to the level where we expect to operate over time, I want to thank the team for maintaining their laser focus on the guest experience. We've spent years growing Target's relationship with our guests, which is fueling the traffic and sales growth we're seeing today. In sustaining that guest focus, we're confident we'll see deeper loyalty and profitable sales growth in the years ahead.\nOn our sales channels, first quarter comps were balanced between store and digital as each increased a little more than 3%. Within our digital channel, growth continues to be led by our same-day services and Drive-Up in particular which delivered growth in the mid-teens this year on top of more than 100% growth a year ago.\nSince Q1 of 2019, prior to the pandemic, first quarter sales have grown more than 40% or just over $7.4 billion. Broken down by channel, store sales accounted for about $4.1 billion of this increase, while digital sales grew another $3.3 billion, having expanded by more than 250% over that time.\nFrom a category perspective, we continue to benefit from our balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to flexibly serve our guests as their wants and needs change. More specifically, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong growth and market share gains in food and beverage and essential categories. We also benefited from double-digit comp growth in Beauty, reflecting our ongoing work to enhance presentation, assortment and service, including our new and expanding partnership with Ulta Beauty. The results of this partnership have exceeded our initial expectations, driving higher productivity and sales in both Beauty area, and adjacent categories in the store, where we've added an Ulta Beauty experience.\nIn our other 3 core merchandise categories: Apparel, Home and Hardlines, we saw a rapid slowdown in the year-over-year sales trends beginning in March, when we began to annualize the impact of last year's stimulus payments. While we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown in these categories and we expect the consumer to continue refocusing their spending away from goods and into services, we didn't anticipate the magnitude of that shift.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this led us to carry too much inventory, particularly in bulky categories, including kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture. And with very little slack capacity after 2 years of unprecedented growth, we faced elevated cost to store and had begun rightsizing our inventory position.\nNevertheless, we're still seeing healthy overall spending by our guests, even as their spending continues to evolve. Notably, we continue to see meaningful spending surges around holidays, including Easter in April and Mother's Day a couple of weeks ago.\nAlso notable, in comparing this year's weekly sales to pre-pandemic levels at the beginning of 2019, we're actually seeing stronger 3-year growth trends in recent weeks compared with the beginning of the first quarter, even in categories where we saw a rapid slowdown on a 1-year basis. These encouraging longer-term growth trends demonstrate the continued resilience of the American consumer and the trust they place in Target even as they face multiple challenges.\nNot surprising, when we talk to our guests, they often express their concerns about a host of rapidly changing conditions, ranging from geopolitics to the high and persistent inflation they've been experiencing, particularly in food and energy. At the same time, guests are focused on getting back to many of the habits and behaviors they suspended during the heart of the pandemic, including travel, out-of-home activities and social gatherings. And importantly, even as the mix of what they're buying continues to evolve, their spending capacity continues to benefit from elevated saving rates, high employment and healthy wage growth.\nSo as we continually adapt our offering to best serve our guests in a rapidly changing environment, today, we're focused more than ever on providing value across our multi-category assortment, presenting options that are affordable and accessible to a broad and diverse base of guests across a wide range of household incomes. And even as we face multiple cost pressures, our team is working tirelessly to maintain prices wherever possible.\nBut of course, while it's always the last lever we pull, external conditions led us to raise prices across a broad set of items in multiple categories. But as you've clearly seen in recent quarters, overall costs have been rising much faster than retail prices, resulting in year-over-year declines in our gross margin rates. While we're not happy about the near-term pressure this causes on the profit line, we strongly believe these decisions will benefit our business over time.\nAnd as we carefully monitor how prices and quality stack up versus the competition, our guests are telling us they appreciate the value and experience we're providing. More importantly, our guests are showing their appreciation, with more footsteps in our stores and more clicks on our site, resulting in continued traffic and sales growth on top of record growth a year ago.\nAs we look ahead, we'll maintain this focus on value, helping them to save time and money in a rapidly evolving environment. For those who are focused on driving fewer miles in response to record high gas prices, our broadened unit merchandise assortment, combined with our low prices, offer a smart way to save time and miles by consolidating shopping trips.\nOf course, for guests who are looking for money-saving options when they're shopping for their families, our $30 billion portfolio of owned brands offer outstanding quality and savings across every one of our merchandising categories. And because saving time is valuable in any environment, we're continuing to invest in expanding the scope of our reliable and convenient same-day services, including our Drive-Up and in-store pickup services, which we offer our guests at no charge.\nJust as we've designed our merchandise portfolio to flexibly serve our guests, our operations have managed through extreme volatility over the last few years. Rapid growth amounting to tens of billions of dollars, combined with unprecedented shifts in demand across categories, channels and services, has created a host of challenges for our team, which they've handled with incredible energy and focus. And while we entered this year hopeful that volatility would begin to moderate, we've experienced the extreme opposite in Q1, and we don't see current conditions improving right away.\nIn the face of this volatility, our team continues to focus on the guest experience, working to ensure that anything our team is handling behind the scenes doesn't affect what our guests see and feel. So as we look ahead, it is clear that many of these pressures will persist in future quarters, but that hasn't affected our long-term plans and expectations, including our confidence in the ability of our business to grow mid-single digits and maintain an operating margin of 8% or higher over time.\nIn the meantime, even as we navigate to restore profitability from the impact of these short-term challenges, we're continuing to invest in projects designed to deliver continued profitable long-term growth. Our business model and team have proven their ability to successfully navigate through extreme volatility. And we're confident our business will emerge even stronger from these challenges we're facing today. Just as our investments in early 2017 were followed by profitable growth in later years, we're confident the decisions we're making today, combined with our investments in future growth, will pay off handsomely over time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Christina.\n\nA. Christina Hennington\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.\nJust a few months ago, at our Financial Community Meeting, my presentation outlined our strategic vision as a company. While I covered many facets of our strategy that day, where I started then is where I want to start again today, with our guests. We frequently get questions about how our guests are feeling given the current economic environment, how their shopping habits are evolving and what's top of mind for them.\nOur guest base encompasses every slice of the American population given that we serve nearly 20 million guests on average each and every week. And the breadth of their individual decisions as they navigate a rapidly changing macro environment is just as broad, making the answers to those questions that much more complex.\nA guest might be telling us that they're worried about inflation and rising gas prices. But they're also looking to splurge on new shoes or some accent pillows for their home. Another guest remains worried about COVID, but they're still planning to resume travel and looking forward to summer outings like Little League games and barbecues with friends. Many guests are sharing their uncertainty of the overall state of the economy, but are feeling more positive about their personal finances. With so much on their minds and a wide array of wants and needs, it has never been more important for Target to be flexible and provide ease, safety, inspiration and solutions for all of our guests.\nIn the first quarter, we invested in delivering a great guest experience to build and maintain the trust and love for the Target brand. And those decisions came with substantial costs. I'll share more on this shortly. Our first quarter results reinforce the power of our multi-category portfolio, which allows us to lean into those ever-changing wants and needs.\nMore and more, we are seeing our guests' increasing mobility and love of newness play out in their Target purchases as baskets shift more toward experiences and going-out categories. This includes notable strength in fashion forward apparel, prepaid cards, toys and travel. While apparel basics moderated in the quarter, trend-based apparel accelerated meaningfully as increasingly, people are returning to the office or dining out with friends. We're also seeing robust growth in Beauty, driven by particular strength in going-out categories like sunscreen, color cosmetics and fragrance. Luggage grew more than 50% as the world continues to reopen, and we reunite with the places and people we have missed visiting.\nAnd our owned brand portfolio continues to grow faster than total sales, as it has quarter-after-quarter for years now. We continuously benefit from the growing guest affinity for our owned brands, which are designed to drive trips to Target, not simply to provide another option when guests are already in a store. Our guests appreciate the value, quality and great design they have come to expect and love from Target owned brands, even as they continue to appreciate our national brand options and partnerships as well.\nAs Brian outlined, our team delivered just over 3% in comparable sales growth in the first quarter, in line with expectations, reflecting strong traffic and unit share gains. First quarter growth was strongest in frequently purchased categories, including Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials.\nFood & Beverage, which delivered low double-digit growth this quarter was strong across the entire assortment. Over the last 3 years, first quarter Food & Beverage sales have increased by nearly $1.8 billion, accounting for nearly 1/4 of our total sales growth over that time. Market share gains in this category are being driven by unit share growth, most notably in our owned brand offerings, as more of our guests turn to Good & Gather and Favorite Day for their meal solutions.\nBeauty has been one of our fastest-growing categories for years now and grew again in the low double digits in Q1 as guests spend more time outside of the home and want to look and feel their best. Since the first quarter of 2019, Beauty sales have expanded by more than 45%, the vast majority of which occurred before our rollout of the Ulta Beauty at Target experience, evidence that there is still plenty of room for growth in this category.\nEssentials grew in the high single digits in Q1, having added well over $1 billion in first quarter sales over the last 3 years. Notably, nearly $0.5 billion of that growth happened after 2020, when we saw explosive demand for categories like household paper, over-the-counter and cleaning supplies.\nAcross our other core categories: Apparel, Home and Hardlines, we saw small declines in comparable sales this quarter. In Apparel, despite unfavorable weather across most of the country, comp sales remained nearly flat to last year, having grown more than 60% in the first quarter a year ago and nearly $1 billion since the first quarter of 2019.\nIn Home, even after a small pullback in Q1 comps, sales remain more than 40% higher than the first quarter of 2019, equating to more than $1.2 billion in growth over that time. Our seasonal categories continue to excel as our guests turn to Target for all of their holiday and celebratory solutions, leading to all-time records in the recent Valentine's Day and Easter seasons.\nAnd notably, guests are finding new ways to enjoy and celebrate the spaces they've invested in over the past few years. Having already renovated their homes with purchases in categories like furniture and small appliances, guests are now refreshing their homes with smaller touches, driving demand in categories like decor, candles and seasonal assortments; further evidence, not just of the strength in our multi-category portfolio, but the breadth of what we offer within categories as well.\nHardlines saw a slight pullback in Q1, but has grown more than $1.3 billion since the first quarter of 2019. Within Hardlines, guests have been refocusing their spending away from electronics like TVs and into experiences for both kids and adults, which led to strength in our toys, travel and prepaid card categories.\nAs Brian mentioned, first quarter gross margin performance was well below our expectations. This was driven by a number of factors, the most impactful of which was softer than expected sales in several categories, resulting in too much inventory in those areas. As we developed our plans for the quarter, our task was to anticipate how spending would change under circumstances no one had ever seen before given that we were about to compare over 2 years of historically high federal stimulus payments. As such, we relied on numerous forecasts and estimates, both internal and external, to help determine our view for the quarter. Despite this careful approach, the mix of actual demand materialized differently than we had anticipated.\nIn addition, as supply grew and demand shifted away from bigger, bulkier products like furniture, TVs and more, we needed to make difficult trade-off decisions. We could keep this product knowing it would sell over time or we can make room for fast-growing categories like Food & Beverage, Beauty, and personal care and Household Essentials. To preserve the quality of on-shelf presentations and support the guest experience, we chose the latter, leading to incremental markdowns that reduced our gross margin. While these were difficult decisions, we believe they'll pay off in the long term, given that building long-term loyalty remains our top priority.\nAs we look ahead, we'll continue to do all we can to support our guests, providing them great value, an unbeatable selection of necessities and affordable luxuries and a shopping experience that sparks a smile and provides a temporary escape. The second quarter offers many opportunities for our team to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. And this summer's assortment features some of our most inclusive offerings yet.\nFirst, in May, we are celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month by highlighting Asian founders and creators, amplifying their voices with stories of how their unique cultures influence the creation of their products and businesses. With June right around the corner, we're excited to honor our LGBTQ+ community as we celebrate Pride Month. This uplifting and always relevant assortment offers bold product, inclusive marketing and everyday affirmation that authentically represents and celebrates community and culture. And of course, we just finished celebrating mom in May and have plenty of options to honor dads in June, along with many other opportunities to celebrate the joys of summer.\nAnd speaking of joy, we're ecstatic about our recently announced expanded partnership with actress, author and social media phenomenon, Tabitha Brown, a beacon of positivity, inspiration and joy. Having collaborated with her on social media for years, we're excited to grow our partnership with Tabitha and feature 4 limited time-only collections set to launch over the next year, starting with an exclusive apparel and accessories line of more than 75 items this June that are sure to lift both style and spirit.\nBefore I pass things over to John, I want to thank our teams across our stores, distribution centers and headquarters locations all around the globe for their unwavering leadership and service to our guests and to each other. Without them, we would not be able to continue growing our business and serving our guests each and every day. Despite the volatility and rapid shifts in consumer demand, the macro environment and the global supply chain, our business remains strong, and we're confident in both our long-term strategy and our team's ability to navigate through this dynamic period.\nWe continue to focus on serving our guests in all that we do through our ability to provide relevance and joy in our assortment, the delivery of a positive one-of-a-kind inspiring guest experience and by building lasting, deepened affinity over time. We're lucky to have the best team in retail to make all of this come to life, and I look forward to all we will do together in the second quarter and beyond.\nWith that, I'll pass things over to John.\n\nJohn J. Mulligan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Christina. Over the last couple of years, our team has been focused on 2 separate and related issues, namely, beginning with the acceleration in sales in early 2020, our inventory wasn't growing fast enough to keep up with the expansion of our sales volume. And as a result, we weren't maintaining in-stock levels consistent with our standards.\nFollowing 2 years of efforts to catch up, by the time we entered 2022, we had made considerable progress. Overall inventory levels were aligned with both the level of sales we had already achieved and our near-term growth expectations. As a result, we began to see improvements in both in-stocks and product availability. However, conditions have remained far from perfect. Some items and categories remained spotty, typically driven by vendors who are facing multiple constraints in their businesses.\nA separate challenge our team has been facing, which became more acute in the back half of 2021, is driven by capacity constraints in both the global and domestic freight markets. These issues continue to make it more difficult and more expensive to move inventory where we need it to be. Our team has done a great job managing through these challenges. And as you've seen from our recent gross margin results, our P&L has reflected those higher freight costs.\nComing into this year, we anticipated we'd see continued tight conditions and elevated costs in freight markets. But the actual conditions and costs have been much more challenging than expected. More specifically, first quarter freight and transportation costs came in hundreds of millions of dollars higher than our already elevated expectations. And for the full year, we're now expecting about $1 billion of incremental freight costs, even compared to our expectations only 3 months ago.\nAmong the reasons for this incremental pressure, record high fuel costs are a meaningful driver as well as the global shipping market, where costs have stayed unusually high and where we sometimes need to rely on the spot market to secure adequate capacity. Compounding these near-term pressures on our gross margin rate, volatility in both consumer demand and delivery times placed additional stress on our supply chain in Q1, one that was already running lean on capacity in light of the growth we've seen over the last 2 years.\nAs Brian and Christina mentioned, this quarter, we ended up carrying too much inventory in several categories where the slowdown in sales was more pronounced than expected, including home, electronics, sporting goods and apparel. In addition, capacity pressures were compounded by the fact that in several of these categories, including kitchen appliances, furniture and outdoor living, items are bulkier than average and require higher-than-average amounts of storage capacity.\nAs our team collaborated with Christina's team to work through this excess inventory, we made decisions with an eye on preserving the guest experience. Rather than jamming store sales floors with excess product, which would have made them more difficult to shop, our team secured temporary storage capacity instead. And as Christina mentioned, rather than carrying items beyond their relevant season, her team made the tougher call and marked items down to clear them and keep our presentations fresh and inspiring.\nWhile these were difficult decisions in the moment, we have no doubt they are the right long-term choices. However, they involved higher costs, resulting directly from the actions we chose to take and indirectly in terms of team member hours required to manage the extra volume. As Michael will discuss in more detail, while we don't expect these conditions to persist over time, they'll continue to impact our Q2 results before conditions begin improving later in the year.\nMore specifically, as we move beyond the front half of the year, we'll have had enough time to adjust inventory levels and receipt volumes to match the pace of sales, even in longer lead time categories. In addition, capacity in our supply chain will continue to build throughout the year as the new buildings we opened last fall continue to ramp up their productivity while we work to open additional buildings in the years ahead.\nBeyond this ongoing work to expand the upstream supply chain, we continue to add downstream capacity in our sortation centers, which increase speed and reduced the unit cost of last mile delivery. Following our successful test of the concept in the Minneapolis market, we now have 6 sortation centers open and operating, with plans to open 3 more by the end of the year.\nWhile the newly opened centers are still ramping up their capacity, in total, our 6 sortation centers handled 4.5 million packages in Q1, a number that's expected to grow significantly throughout the year. Each of these facilities already has volume flowing to our national carrier partners, including the ability to sort USPS packages individually by post office, creating a high-speed, low-cost delivery option in the metro areas surrounding each center.\nIn addition, we've begun rolling out our lowest cost delivery option, Target last-mile delivery, at our Atlanta sortation center and will soon expand that capability to the other 4 recently opened facilities. For this capability, we collaborate with our partners at Shipt, whose drivers sign up to deliver batches of orders that have been sorted hyperlocally down to the neighborhood level. This provides a fast, efficient, reliable and low-cost delivery option for our business, benefiting both our guests and the P&L. While we're excited about the results these centers are already delivering, this initiative is in the very early stages, and we have plans to continue opening centers and ramping up this new capability for years to come.\nBeyond investments in the supply chain, we're also excited about the investments we're making in our stores, allowing them to become more productive, more fun and more inspiring to shop. For the year, we have plans to complete remodel projects in nearly 400 stores. And through the first quarter, we had already mobilized on just under half of those projects, keeping us on pace for the year. Just under 200 of this year's projects will be traditional full remodels in which we transform every part of the store, from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, updating the shopping experience to make it more inspiring for our guests and more efficient for our team to operate.\nBeyond those full remodels, we're planning to complete just over 200 fulfillment remodels in 2022 as well. These projects are focused on the operations of the store and their ability to support our same-day services. More specifically, these projects make changes within the 4 walls of the store to add capacity for same-day orders and incorporate features to enhance our pickup and Drive-Up capabilities.\nWhen warranted, these remodels include the addition of walk-in coolers and freezers near the front of the store, adding reliable capacity for our team to fulfill fresh, refrigerated and frozen items through our pickup and Drive-Up services. In addition, with many of these projects, we add a dedicated door for our team members to use when delivering Drive-Up orders to the parking lot. We're also adding canopies, more prominent signing and more Drive-Up spaces in our parking lots, making the Drive-Up process safer and easier for both our team members and our guests.\nBeyond these existing store investments, we continue to open new stores around the country. In the first quarter, we opened 7 locations, all smaller formats, in markets ranging from Jackson Hole in Wyoming to Times Square in New York. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores and our ability to flexibly serve guests in new neighborhoods. And for our stores and markets that were temporarily affected by COVID, including college locations, tourist destinations and dense urban areas, we've seen continued rapid recovery in sales volumes as activity ramps up in those markets following periods of lockdown over the last 2 years.\nSimilar to the pressures we've been experiencing in our merchandise costs, our construction team has been dealing with volatility in the price of raw materials and labor in our new store and remodel projects. And like our merchandising partners, they've done a great job working around those costs and constraints, keeping projects on track while maintaining their focus on delivering a great guest experience.\nSo as I get ready to hand the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank the entire operations team, from our stores, to supply chain, and our properties team to our partners at Shipt. The growth we've seen in our business and the expansion of our capabilities over the last 2 years has been both energizing and inspiring, but it certainly hasn't been easy for our team. They've handled growth well beyond what any of us would have expected 2 years ago, even as they worked around new challenges and unexpected obstacles.\nOne of the joys of the last year has been the ability for me to once again get out in the field, traveling to our stores and distribution facilities around the country, and experiencing firsthand the energy and positive attitude our team brings to work. They're united in their support of our guests, for our brand and for each other. Every day, they bring our company purpose to life. And every day, I am inspired by what they accomplish.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, John. I want to start my remarks today where John just ended and add my thanks to our entire team. Even with all of the challenges they've been facing, they refused to get distracted. Instead, they maintained their focus on our company purpose, to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Our team shows up to work every day with a passion for serving all families and for serving each other.\nAs John mentioned, it's been a joy in recent months to be able to travel once again, meet with teams across the country and hear what's on their minds. And the optimism and energy of our team is infectious. I can feel that whenever I meet with the team, and obviously, our guests can feel it when they shop, which explains why our first quarter traffic has increased more than 20% over the last 2 years.\nIn the first quarter, our comp increase of 3.3% was supported by a traffic increase of 3.9%, partially offset by a small decrease in average ticket. Among our fulfillment channels, store sales grew slightly faster than digital in the quarter. Within digital, same-day services continue to drive our growth, and accounted for well over half of our first quarter digital sales; within our same-day services, Drive-Up accounts for the majority of sales, and it continues to grow the fastest. In fact, of the $3.3 billion in first quarter digital sales that we've added since 2019, Drive-Up accounts for nearly half of that growth.\nOn the first quarter gross margin line, we saw a rate decline of about 4.3 percentage points compared with last year. Among the causal factors, merchandising actions drove about 3 percentage points of the decline, driven by the combined impact of impairments, markdowns and other actions taken to rightsize our inventory position in categories that were too heavy, along with the impact of higher freight costs.\nAmong other drivers, higher supply chain costs accounted for a little over one percentage point of this year's rate decline, reflecting the impact of higher headcount and compensation in our distribution centers. Sales mix accounted for the remainder of the decline, worth about 10 basis points of pressure.\nOn the SG&A expense line, we benefited from fixed cost leverage and strong expense control throughout the quarter, which helped to offset the impact of inflation-driven cost increases in multiple expense lines. Within compensation, the continued impact of team investments was offset by lower incentive compensation compared with last year.\nOn the D&A expense line, we saw about 10 basis points of benefit in Q1, reflecting leverage on strong revenue growth. Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate of 5.3% was about 4.5 percentage points lower than last year. While we expected this year's rate would be well below last year, our actual performance in the quarter was far lower than we anticipated, driven by the unexpectedly high costs we incurred on the gross margin line.\nTurning now to capital deployment, I'll start where I always do, by reiterating our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. First, we fully invest in our business and projects that support our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and look to build on our 50-year record of annual dividend growth. And finally, we return any remaining excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time.\nBeginning with the top priority, first quarter CapEx was just under $1 billion, keeping us on track to spend $4 billion to $5 billion for the year. While our teams continue to face multiple challenges, including supply shortages, shipping delays and permitting and inspection delays in some communities, they're doing a great job of working around these obstacles and keeping projects moving.\nIn addition, as John mentioned, unexpected inflationary pressures are affecting some of our capital projects, which will impact our total spending for the year. As I mentioned at our recent Financial Community Meeting, we're excited to make progress on our capital projects, which continue to move our business forward. And today, given the team's efforts to advance this year's projects, I believe we'll reach the high end of our $4 billion to $5 billion plan for the year.\nMoving to our second priority. We paid dividends of $424 million in the first quarter, up about 25% from last year. reflecting a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. We plan to recommend that our Board approve a healthy increase in the quarterly dividend, in the mid-teens to low 20% range later this year, keeping 2022 on track to be our 51st consecutive year of annual dividend increases.\nAnd finally, regarding share repurchases. Given our strong leverage metrics coming into the year, we entered into an accelerated repurchase plan in the first quarter, which will result in the retirement of up to $2.75 billion of our stock by the time the plan settles in June. In addition to this ASR, we repurchased another $10 million in shares in the first quarter.\nWhile we anticipate having continued ample capacity to return capital through share repurchases this year, given the current supply chain challenges we're facing and their impact on working capital, we now expect our total repurchases this year will be lower than the $7 billion we returned in 2021. As always, we'll adjust our pace, up or down, based on external conditions, business performance and cash flow, with a goal of maintaining our middle A credit ratings.\nSo now I want to turn to our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures both our profitability and the efficiency of our CapEx decisions over time. In the first quarter, we reported a trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC of 25.3%. While this is a very strong number, indicative of the underlying health of our business, it was much lower than expected, near the very low end of where we expect to operate over time.\nNow let's turn to our guidance. In terms of the top line, based on our first quarter results and the trends we've seen so far in May, we continue to expect full year revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. In terms of our profitability, given the unexpected cost headwinds that we're currently facing, we now believe our full year operating margin rate will be well below our prior guidance of 8% or higher. More specifically, given the elevated level of volatility we're currently facing and multiple sources of uncertainty going forward, we see a range of potential outcomes, centered around a 6% operating margin rate for the full year.\nAs John mentioned, in the second quarter, we expect the challenges we faced in the first quarter will continue to impact our near-term profit performance. And our team is focused on doing everything necessary to ensure we enter the fall season with an appropriate level of inventory by category. As such, we expect a Q2 operating margin rate in a wide range, centered around our first quarter rate to 5.3%, well below where we'd expect to operate under normal conditions.\nAs we move into the back half of the year, we continue to expect our profit performance will begin to improve. In particular, as John mentioned, we expect to have worked through the excess inventory positions that hampered our Q1 performance and which we expect to impact our gross margin in Q2. That said, we don't expect the external environment will be anything close to normal in the back half of the year. In particular, we don't expect to see any meaningful reduction in global supply chain pressures until 2023 at the earliest. So the elevated costs we've been facing will continue to affect our profitability for the remainder of the year.\nBut let me be clear about a couple of things. First, we are not happy with our current profit performance, and our team is laser-focused on helping to quickly restore our business performance to where it should be operating over time. That said, nothing that is happening today has changed our long-run expectations regarding the ability of our business to grow nor has it changed our view of the long-run potential of our business to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher over time.\nAnd today, as we navigate these near-term challenges, we are fortunate to have an incredibly healthy underlying business, one that can stand up to the significant headwinds we're facing and come out stronger on the other side. We have ample financial capacity to continue making long-term investments, in new stores, remodels, supply chain, and of course, in our team, all with a focus on serving and delighting our guests, driving deeper loyalty, and building on the top line growth we've seen in recent years and which continues today.\nAfter all, even after a significant pullback from last year, first quarter earnings per share were more than 40% higher than in the first quarter of 2019 prior to the beginning of the pandemic. While that doesn't mean we're where we want to be operating today, it shows we have a strong foundation from which we can recover from today's challenging environment and restore our operating margins to 8% or higher over time, consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. And given the loyalty and momentum we've established with our guests and the power of the investments we continue to make, we expect to continue growing the top line, even as we regain the level of profitability we expect our business will generate over time.\nNow I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to take a few minutes to reinforce why we're confident in the ability of our team and our durable business model to successfully navigate today's volatile environment and deliver continued profitable market share growth in the years ahead.\nAs Michael covered, even as elevated costs put meaningful pressure on our near-term financial performance, our business today remains profitable and very healthy, and it continues to grow. Since the first quarter of 2019, both our revenue on the top line and our EPS on the bottom line have each grown by more than 40%. Underlying that growth, we benefited from strong increases in both guest traffic and average ticket over the last 3 years, meaning the guests have found more reasons to visit our stores and our site and purchase more when they shop. This is the definition of a durable business model, one that can stand up to the unexpected pressures and remain healthy and growing.\nWhen I think about the critical drivers of our long-term success, there are 2 things that rise to the top of that list: our team; and the relationship we've developed with our guests. And when I think about the quality of our team, I don't believe that it's ever been better.\nOver the last 5 years, we've made significant, purposeful investments to ensure we're hiring, elevating and retaining the best team in retail. These investments begin with paying benefits. But we've also found new ways to enhance the work experience and provide pathways for advancements, all in keeping with our Target forward goals to create an equitable and inclusive workforce and workplace. So even as we work tirelessly to restore our business to its long-term profitability, you should expect us to continue investing in our team, because we'll never achieve our longer potential without them.\nWe have the same perspective regarding relationships with our guests. Over the last 5 years, we've made a number of deliberate decisions that were designed to deepen the relationship between Target and our guests. These decisions have resulted in ever-increasing traffic, translating to growth on both the top line and the bottom.\nSo in the quarter just ended, when our team was facing potential trade-offs between a guest experience and incurring short-term costs, I am proud to say that they maintained their focus on the guest experience. That's because our team is laser-focused on our long-term financial performance, which depends on building and maintaining an ever-deepening relationships with our guests.\nSo with that, I want to thank you for listening into our call today. And now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.",

I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting remotely this morning. And for the first time in 3 years, it's great to welcome everyone who's here with us in person in New York.\nBefore I turn it over to Brian, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most comparable -- directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian to begin the meeting.\n(presentation)\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nGood morning. It's great to be back here in New York for our first live event since the start of the pandemic. I can tell you, our entire team has been looking forward to seeing you in person. It's been a long couple of years.\nBut I also have to acknowledge the continued uncertainty that surrounds our world, which has only been magnified by the growing conflict between Russia and the citizens of Ukraine. It serves as another reminder of our continued need to support our teams, our guests, our communities as we all navigate these very challenging times.\nIt's been 5 years since I stood in front of many of you, the head of then a $70 billion company. I was a little nervous as I laid out a bold new company strategy. Today, I stand in front of you as the head of a $106 billion growth company with a long list of proof points that our strategy is working.\nWe've delivered 19 consecutive quarters of comp growth: 11 quarters of comp growth before the pandemic, 8 quarters of comp growth since the pandemic. We've grown because we've accelerated our investments in our team and in our strategy. We've accelerated our growth because our team stepped up in heroic ways, meeting the explosive demands that materialized with the pandemic.\n5 years ago, we had 1,800 stores. I announced the plan to add stores and upgrade the stores we had. And I saw jaws drop and our stock price dive for a while. At that time, retail was about closing stores, not opening them. Many of you questioned our approach. Now 5 years later, we have almost 2,000 stores, and we're still remodeling and building new stores.\nWe also know the way we run our stores is the secret to growing digital sales. Yes, the way we run our stores is the secret to why digital is now 19% of sales. So as we look at the next 5 years, we're going to continue to build on our strengths. We have a culture, we have the connections, and we care. We care about delighting our guests. We care about delivering value to our stakeholders. And as you see in our fourth quarter results, we're accelerating our investment in what's next as we continue to deliver what's now.\nFor Q4, our comp sales were up nearly 9%. We achieved standout results relative to the market. We achieved growth on top of last year's all-time record growth. Our full year comp was up a remarkable 12.7%. In the last 2 years, we've grown by more than 35%. That's more than $27 billion. That figure alone would place the company in the top quarter of the Fortune 500.\nAnd we're seeing the benefits of stores as hubs. Growth was split nearly 50-50 between stores and digital dollars. Over this time frame, we grew 2021 traffic by more than 12% on top of nearly 4% in 2020. And we posted 2021 after-tax return on invested capital of 33%. We achieved all this growth while protecting consumers from dramatic cost of good inflation, delivering adjusted EPS that is 44% higher than last year and more than double where it was in 2019 and funding all of our ambitious strategic investments completely.\nOur Q4 results show we're taking our strategy forward to the next level with speed, with efficiency and with relevance, with care. Over the next 75 minutes, we'll show you how we're investing in opportunities for big wins. We've added Ulta Beauty to our stores. So far, our sales per square foot are strong. Guest engagement is impressive. We see the scale of opportunities as being even more impressive. We'll show you how we translated a massive influx of insights from new guests and loyal guests who are engaging even more. You'll see how we're accelerating our capabilities in personalization, creating an always-on, inspiring guest experience and driving unparalleled value to our partners with a fast-growing revenue stream for our business through Lundell.\nWe'll show you how we're adding capacity, efficiency and innovation across stores and supply chain operations, driving the next phase of stores and hubs. We'll show you how we're growing by increasing our multi-category assortment. We'll show you how we're making incredible progress in a category like Food & Beverage. And above all, we'll show you how we're growing by keeping investments in our team constant. We believe our constant investment creates that critical connection between social and environmental sustainability. ESG is a critical part of our Target Forward strategy. So yes, we're going to keep growing in 2022. And knowing this, we've upgraded our long-term financial algorithm. Michael will lay that out later this morning.\nWe are a bigger, stronger company now. We're growing on a bigger base than ever, and we recognize the power of AND. We have a slate of focused initiatives, and they work together in unison. We have a connection to our guests, and we have relevance to their lives. We have physical/digital experiences and the only at Target touches. We have a multi-category portfolio and a differentiated approach to curating owned and national brands. We have scale in same-day services and the pathway for more digital growth, thanks to the synchronized operation of stores, fulfillment centers, flow centers, sortation centers and Shipt.\nWe have the commitment for Target forward, and we can use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet. We'll serve our guests through challenging times, and we'll find terrific opportunities for growth. We definitely have the power of AND. We know today's consumers are facing a series of follow hardships from the pandemic. We see higher prices across the country. We see supply chain constraints that are steadily working themselves out but will likely take more time, both of which are made more uncertain by the crisis in Ukraine.\nAnd we see people reevaluating how they think about work. Millions of people are searching for careers that have meaning and purpose, and they are turning to companies like Target for opportunities. As you'll hear today, we're walking our stakeholders through these challenges. We have the global scale to keep the products people want and need moving through our pipeline. We have the value levers, multi-category assortment and multichannel shopping experience. And we allow our guests to consolidate trips, get more done in one store and experience a little bit of affordable luxury for their families, especially in this inflationary economy.\nAbove all, we built a culture that cares. Our teams understand the way to grow and win together is to care. They care about each other. They care about our guests. They care about our communities. They care about the millions of families we touch each and every day. As I look at the future of Target, I increasingly see care separating us from the industry. So before we dive in a corporate strategy and operational details, I want to tie some of these things together. I want to show you how our potential, our culture, our connection and caring tie into a business model that will deliver even more personalized, even more equitable, even more sustainable growth in the future.\nFor a concrete example, look no further than the announcement we made yesterday to invest up to $300 million to set a new starting wage and to expand access to health care benefits to more team members and their families. 2 years ago, we raised our starting minimum wage to an industry-leading $15 per hour. Now we're setting new starting wage ranges of $15 to $24 per hour, positioning Target as a wage leader in every market where we operate.\nWe'll also provide broader, faster access to health care for hourly team members, making nearly 20% of our team newly eligible for benefits and reducing the waiting period for all hourly store team members to enroll in Target medical plans. You can count on us to keep leading with investments like these. But to really appreciate where we're headed as a company, I want you to know not just what we're investing in but whom.\nI'm thinking of Jen Mayer, Store Director of T1235 in Hudson, Wisconsin. Jen started as an intern 26 years ago. Since then, she's gone on to lead stores for Target in Iowa, Missouri, Indiana and Minnesota. In the 2 years since she moved to Hudson, store sales have increased by 30%. You'll hear about chain-wide figures like that from John. And Jen's store is a proof point to that trend. Shortly after she started in Hudson, Jen oversaw the introduction of Drive Up right at the start of the pandemic. And in 2 short years, our stores rocketed up to the top 75 for Drive Up.\nSo the store performance is strong, but that's not what caught my attention. Instead, it was a speech by one of Jen's team members, a 27-year-old named Lindsey, one of the thousands of team members who joined Target in the pandemic. In front of a Black Tie Gala last fall, Lindsey related how she was devastated after losing her previous job during the COVID lockdowns of 2020. Here's what she had to say.\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nIt is a privilege and honor to tell you how I became a Target team member. My Target story is one of inclusion and acceptances. As we know, when the pandemic happened and businesses and people were affected everywhere, I sat home Cryan about being laid off from my job and needing a schedule. I wanted it and needed to work. I'd like to shop by Target, so I thought you know that would be a good place to work.\nThat's when all of my own I have updated my resume and sent my application in. I didn't need my mom's help this time. She wasn't in my interview either like she was in the past. 45 minutes into the interview and telling them that I had to be honest, I have autism. They said, \"Thank you for sharing. Welcome to Target.\"\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nNo one who knows Jen or her team would be the least bit surprise that they hired Lindsey on the spot or that Lindsey has had a great development experience in the store, is doing well and appreciates our extended target family. Jen speaks for the company when she says, it's important to give everyone opportunities. In her 20 years as a store director, she's moved hundreds of team members from part-time to full-time. She's developed and promoted dozens of team members to leadership positions. She's helped them cope with trauma, overcome disparities, build skills and save for the future.\nShe speaks boldly for her culture when she says, \"I ask myself, what would I want someone to do for me? And then I tried to do that times 10.\" This is the kind of question we ask ourselves to the company all the time: what can we do with our resources, with our strategy and plans with our team and culture to serve the world around us in a bigger or beneficial way?\nSo as I hand off to our team, I'll ask you to keep that story in mind. Jen Meyer will be the first to tell you we're just getting started, that you can't equate accelerated returns with exhausted ones. Her store with those strong results hasn't even been touched by a remodel. Starting in April, T1235 will get an Ulta Beauty and a Disney store, will significantly increase the size of her grocery footprint and add a dedicated entrance for Drive Up and Order Pick Up given the volume of same-day services. And the growth from this remodel will spur Jen's store even higher. It will combine with thousands of comparable examples countrywide to bring more joy, more equity and opportunity and even more growth in both financial and societal terms to our stakeholders here and around the world.\nChristina?\n\nA. Christina Hennington\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Growth Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. This morning, I'm eager to give you a peek behind the curtain to answer the question, what's next for Target? And the short answer is a lot. I'd like to share with you a deeper look into the growth framework we use to drive our strategies forward. With a fortified foundation and the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests, we're continuing to build what's working strategically while making smart choices to launch new initiatives.\nWhile I plan to spend most of my time today sharing our specific strategies and the lens through which we view them, let's first acknowledge what enables the execution of these strategies in the first place: our team, our operations and technology. The investments we've made in these areas will empower everything we'll share today. In fact, they're increasingly becoming differentiated growth drivers in their own rights, and they propel our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. And at the center of that purpose, you see our guests. Everything we do should be rooted in a deep understanding of what our guests want, along with empathy to understand what they need.\nOur culture to care, grow and win together, coupled with our core values of inclusivity, connection and drive, support our purpose. Without them, our purpose statement is just words on the page. It's only when we're aligned on who we are, what we care about and how we drive forward together that our purpose comes to life.\nHere's a recent example. One of our guests, Nicholas, recently lost his sister to cancer. One of his family's most prized possessions was a photo of a sister in an opal-housed picture frame that she gave to him before he passed. One day, the frame fell and shattered. Unable to find a replacement, Nicholas reached out to us with a plea for help. The frame, unfortunately, was no longer in production. But the owned brand team tracked down 2 remaining frames, which they sent to Nicolas and his wife, complete with handwritten notes of sympathy and care from the Target team.\nNicolas shared with the team, \"I know it's just a frame, but there's a lot of meaning behind it. What you did may seem small, but it represents so much more.\" This is just one example of how our team continuously shows up living out our values and putting care first. I am so grateful for their unwavering commitment to our guests, the communities they serve and each other, all in service of our purpose.\nSo now let's go deeper into each of our 6 strategic pillars, distinct but interwoven aspects of how we intend to grow. They represent core ideas to create forward motion for our business and help define the sum of the parts that is uniquely target. Let's begin with one of the most iconic differentiators at Target, our brands.\nThrough our careful balance of exclusive owned brands and industry-leading national brands, Target differentiates by curating a unique assortment, driving preference in a crowded retail landscape. We built guest affinity through our flagship brands like Good & Gather, All in Motion, Cat & Jack and Threshold. We've also continued to innovate with new brands such as Brightroom, Target's first dedicated storage and home organization owned brand; and Kindful, our first pet food brand with premium ingredients and no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.\nThrough our world-class design and sourcing functions, we are able to develop and produce product, add incredible quality and value, always a focus for our guests, but never more so than in an inflationary environment. To illustrate the scale of our owned brands, in 2021 alone, Target sold more than 330 million units in Cat & Jack, equating to nearly 7 items for every child in the United States under the age of 11. And even though these brands are already big, they're still growing. In fact, Target's owned brands grew 18% in 2021. And at more than $30 billion, our owned brand sales alone now rival the size of some Fortune 100 companies.\nBut as we've said before, it isn't about owned or national brands. The harmony created between them is part of what makes Target unique. Our recent progress in denim serves as a perfect example. Years ago, we recognized a vast opportunity to elevate denim's role at Target, stemming from considerable guests and market research. So when Universal Thread and Goodfellow launched, both featured extensive new denim offerings, including a variety of styles and inclusive sizing, all at sharp price points. The guest reaction was to the quality and value was fantastic.\nWe further rounded out the assortment by deepening our partnership with Levi's, which continues to grow. All told, the interplay between our owned and national brands has reinvigorated this category, bringing us from a retailer that sold denim to a denim destination, having grown sales in this category by more than $150 million since 2019.\nAnd Levi's isn't the only growing partnership at Target. We're also deepening our relationship with leading national brand partners like Disney, Apple and Ulta Beauty. Brian touched on the strong results we're seeing with our first 100 Ulta Beauty at Target stores. We entered this partnership knowing our guests were looking for prestige beauty brands and industry-leading expertise, and that's exactly what these new shops are delivering.\nIn stores where we've added an Ulta Beauty experience, guests are buying incremental items from the Ulta Beauty assortment while continuing to shop the beauty brands they loved at Target for years. In fact, these new spaces average more than 2x the productivity of the rest of the store, and the growth is proving to be incremental. Specifically, in stores that have added an Ulta Beauty section, we're seeing a mid-teens lift across total Beauty and productivity lifts in complementary categories as well. With these incredible results, we remain committed to operating at least 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations over time with plans to add more than 250 new locations in 2022.\nAt Target, we pride ourselves on the level of service and shopping experience we provide. As John and Mark will share in more detail, we made meaningful investments in progress in the store shopping experience over the past several years. So I'll focus on our opportunity to grow our in-store services.\nTarget has long been a destination and escape largely because of the differentiated experience we provide. In-store services are one more way we can make life easier for our guests, helping them to accomplish more in a single trip to their local store. Years ago, we began our partnership with CVS Health to provide pharmacy services in our stores, and they continue to deliver exceptional care and expertise today. This not only benefits our guests who fulfill their prescriptions in our stores but also consolidates another trip, simplifying their lives.\nSimilarly, we provide convenient, well-established optical services, which we have at more than 500 of our stores and growing. Yet we still have an opportunity to do more. Let me share an example of a recent pilot we plan to scale. In 2021, Target began testing ear piercing at several Minneapolis-based stores. Our research found that guests were looking for a reliable, safe and convenient place to get their families' ears pierced. So we created a joyful and differentiated experience, making us the first-and-only national retailer to offer ear piercings performed by a licensed nurse. This service helps us connect and celebrate a major milestone with often younger guests, creating lasting affinity for our brand.\nGiven the success of the pilot, we recently expanded the rollout to nearly 200 stores with plans to meaningfully increase that number by the end of 2022. This is a fantastic example of what happens when we listen to our guests, deeply research the market opportunities and create a differentiated solution.\nAnother growth pillar is our focus on affordability as value remains among the biggest loyalty builders in retail. Our goal is to deliver unbeatable value by providing affordability across every category every day. After all, we established our Expect More, Pay Less promise decades ago, and we're continuously evolving what it means to deliver great value.\nGiven that the U.S. economy is experiencing the highest inflation rate in decades, the American consumer is becoming increasingly price-conscious. This is why we believe our comprehensive view of affordability, which focuses on price but encompasses so much more, sets Target apart from our competitors, driving deep engagement and growing loyalty. Our guests tell us that affordability begins with price, but also includes proximity, accessibility and assortment choices that satisfy any budget.\nIt also means receiving valuable benefits like those we offer through Target Circle, including exclusive promotions and deals, 1% earnings to redeem on future purchases and the ability to help direct Target's charitable-giving to the causes our guests care most about; and the industry-leading benefits we offer with our REDcard holders, including 5% of every transaction, free shipping on Target.com and no annual membership fees. Over the years, REDcard guests have saved more than $9 billion on their purchases, including more than $1 billion in 2021 alone.\nNow I'd like to share a bit more about 2 emerging growth pillars in our framework. While they represent more nascent opportunities, they are positioned to spur incremental growth on top of our existing strategies. The first is our focus on relevance, something we've long worked to maintain and grow with every guest interaction. Brian shared the compelling opportunity we have to better harness and apply the power of guest insights. Through this opportunity, we can optimize our assortment, more effectively make offers to our guests, and most importantly, personalize our interactions with them. We've long known the joint value we can create for our vendors, our guests and Target by connecting guests to the products they want and need.\nBut as we continue to deepen our relationship with the guests, our ability to refine and elevate this value is extraordinary and will continue to drive outsized growth over the next several years through the likes of Target Circle, Roundall and Target Plus. Carol will provide more detail on these rapidly growing platforms in a moment.\nFinally, I want to highlight Target Forward, the newest chapter in a long history of strong corporate responsibility at our company. At a time when the American consumer is becoming increasingly focused on not just what they buy but also where and how the product was made, how its production impacts the world and those who produced it, and how companies function as citizens of a global community, we are proud of our bold commitments to better people in the planet with every choice we make.\nAs we grow and continue to develop our new owned brands, our Target Forward commitment is to design and elevate circular, sustainable brands. Of course, these brands will begin with a focus on our guests but also consider the impact to the world. We aspire for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future by 2040.\nAdditionally, our teams will continue designing to eliminate waste, using materials that are regenerative, recycled or sourced sustainably to create products that are more durable, easily repaired or recyclable as well. Beyond our sustainability efforts, our aspirations to accelerate opportunity equity are equally pivotal. While we still have far to go, Target's Reach Committee is encouraged to be leading the industry with progress against virtually every goal we have set forth. We'll continue to share specific progress over time, but I want to highlight a few examples with you today.\nThe first is in our Beauty business, where we have increased our black-owned or founded brands by 65% since 2020 and are now leading the industry with more than 70 black-owned and founded brands. Some of these entrepreneurs launched through Target's Accelerator programs designed to quickly scale brands at Target.\nEntrepreneur Cora Miller of the Black-owned Hair Care business, Young King Hair Care, went through our 2020 Target Takeout program and subsequently launched in 365 Target stores. Given the immediate success and reaction from our guests, we now have plans to expand this line into significantly more stores in 2022. Cora is among a group of fewer than 100 Black female entrepreneurs to raise more than $1 million in venture funds ever. We want Cora's story to become the rule, not the exception. We'll continue to elevate entrepreneurs like her through Accelerator programs, including the recently launched Forward Founders program, which equips historically under resource centers to build their businesses and gain access to industry-leading retail resources and partnerships. When more than half of our first cohort comprised of Black entrepreneurs, we aim to provide a launching point for many new and emerging Black-owned businesses.\nIf we've proven anything over the last few years, it's that Target's a growth company. Even though we're now more than a $100 billion business, the opportunities for growth are immense. We have created momentum through unique and innovative strategies, many of which began long before the onset of the pandemic. And because of our durable, flexible business model, we have proven we can adapt to any environment. We'll continue to play offense and accelerate these strategies while listening to the ever-changing wants and needs of our guests to ensure our playbook is a direct reflection of what they have come to expect from Target.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cara, who will provide more color on some of our powerful growth strategies.\n\nCara Sylvester\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Marketing & Digital Officer, Target Corporation\n\nHello, everyone. I'm excited to be here to share a view of Target's growth through our guest sizes because as Christina shared, everything we do should be rooted in a deep understanding of what our guests want, along with the empathy to understand what they need and how those needs continue to evolve. In the next few minutes, I want to show you how our commitment to relevance has positioned Target to deliver the most personalized omnichannel experience in retail.\nIn my first year as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer, I've had the privilege of sharing Target's story in many virtual firesides, roundtables and interviews. And the common thread, when I think about all of those times, is that people always ask me how Target stays 3 steps ahead with our guests in these rapidly changing times. And while I'm not a huge fan of giving away all the keys to success, I always point to our culture of care and our core value of inclusivity that have us listening and learning from our guests deeply and continuously.\nWhen our insights team talks with guests, we don't just ask them questions about Target and their experiences shopping with us. Guests share their hopes with us, their fears and their dreams. They share simply what's going on in their lives. Through these ongoing check-ins, every area of our enterprise has a view of the holistic human experience lived by our guests during the pandemic and what that might mean for Target in the future.\nWe also know from brand research what matters most to guests when they shop and connect with us. Ease and affordability are essential, but our guests are looking for more, too: quality and value, community and connection, inclusivity and feeling seen, what Brian calls the power of and. And what gets me really excited is how we're delivering loud and proud on these personal guest values at scale.\nTarget's digital experience, which we have been investing in for years, plays a key role here as a gateway to our guests and a huge growth driver for us. Our digital business has nearly tripled in the last 2 years and in 2021 delivered a 20% comp on top of a 145% comp the year prior. Then there's 45% comp growth in digitally enabled same-day services on top of 235% last year. And our flagship Target app has moved from 30% of digital demand a little over 2 years ago to closing in on 70% today.\nBut the biggest differentiator when you look at Target's digital experience, it is designed with guests at the center. We take the friction out so that guests can experience Target on their own terms, which means we are guest-obsessing at every touch point to stay a step ahead of evolving guest behaviors. For example, we're leaning into the love our guests have for our digitally led same-day services because that's sticking. Routines developed early in the pandemic are now part of their lives, things they cannot live without. But they look a little bit different today.\nSo here's a guest who had a drive a border, our highest NPS service, but then she was drawn inside to discover something new. Then there's this guest who said, \"Can we just talk about the fact that you can go through Target with Starbucks at hand and then go through Ulta?\" These new kinds of target runs and stock-ups reflect our guests' evolving needs and wants and a seamless omnichannel experience that delivers on them.\nToday, Target has 40 million guests in counting shopping across channels. And as you've heard us share before, omnichannel guests spend 4x as much as stores-only guests and even more compared to digital-only guests. Target can bring together insights across an omnichannel journey, from REDcard and registry, to digital and in-store, to our call centers and every step in between, which means we're getting a 360-degree view of the kind of guests that are driving so much growth.\nWith these meaningful insights, we can make sure that Target Magic they love is even more relevant in their lives and the experience even more personalized. So you can imagine what this looks like. For one guest scrolling through the app, what she sees is curated especially for her. There's her favorite items and great deals on her go-to essentials for weeknight dinners. And because she told us she's a teacher, it really means something to her when she sees a Target Circle offer that makes her classroom supplies more affordable.\nJust getting ideas for what to pack in lunchboxes for her kids this week, too, maybe a little something from Good & Gather. And what's more, her app experience helps make life easier as someone who might need a shopping partner once in a while. That's our name for a new service that allows her husband to do the Target run while she's working, a service that is near and dear to my family's heart. So she checks out and later that afternoon, he picks up what's for dinner.\nHere's another kind of personalized guest journey that we're obsessing over. A guest is shopping for essentials when he sees a message from a banner ad about Clorox' Glad bags. He's purchased them before, but other brands too. The headline benefits really resonate with him. So this time, he adds Glad to his cart, he checks out and drives up. Purchases like this one contributed to a 40% higher return on ad spend for Clorox and a 25% increase in customer retention over the duration of the campaign.\nLet me share the back story on this type of Target run. At the start of the pandemic, Clorox saw growth in guests buying their products for the first time, and they wanted to retain them. So they turn to our media company, RoundDell, to measure guest values and behaviors. Using that research, Rondell developed a series of A/B tests, and Clorox used those key insights to optimize messaging and audience targeting.\nHow we're leveraging media to know our guests better and create a more relevant and personalized experience for them is incredibly exciting, and so is this. From its humble beginnings in 2007 with just 5 team members and known as online vendor marketing, Roundel is now a 500-plus person strong fully integrated Target team, already delivering more than $1 billion in value for Target, and we expect that to grow to $2 billion over the next several years. To sum up ROnDell, it's positioned for continued success because it's delivering on relevance and value. That's a win-win-win for Target, for our partners and for our guests.\nNow I'd say the same thing about Target Plus. Target Plus is different than other marketplaces. It's invite-only with vetted partners we have relationships with who are extending our aisles digitally. And because of our trusted and curated assortment, our guests aren't sifting through thousands of pages of results for the one thing that's going to bring them joy. In fact, Target Plus is so seamless on the things that matter the ease of the experience, a relevant assortment and the benefits of REDcard and in-store returns, the majority of guests don't know they're shopping with marketplace. It feels like Target. It feels personal, and the love for marketplace is only growing. In 2021, Target Plus grew 75%.\nSo let's take a look through our guests' eyes. In Target stores, our assortment of sunglasses features a curated set of options designed to meet the wants and needs of a broad set of families. For this guest, though, who's purchased Goodfellow shades to keep at home, at work, in his car, he's thinking about splurging for his upcoming vacation. The RayBan aviator he's looking for our online, and he's over the moon about the REDcard savings as he makes the purchase from our partner, Luxottica. And when he decides on a pair -- different pair that will frame his face even better, it's easy enough to stop by the store and let us handle the returns.\nWith rich insights from omnichannel experiences, we're able to serve up even more deals that guests want, more suggestions of services they've never thought of, more ways to support brands and nonprofits close to their hearts.\nAnd that brings me to Target Circle, which I'm really excited to talk about. So here's a lesser engaged guests who joined Circle through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. She's able to seamlessly link her Ultimate Rewards account for Circle for all of the benefits. She's thrilled that she can now find her favorite skin care brand and her go-to mascara at her local Target store. And I want to pause here for just a second.\nChristina told us about how we're off to a great start with the Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops. But let's recognize how that partnership is translating to digital and loyalty with our guests. We're getting to know these guests in Circle, leading to more personalized experiences that are serving up the things they crave. And back to this guest, other things she may love like Wild Fable. So in such a short time, someone who only shop occasionally is now on the path to super fandom.\nCircle is a way for us to deeply understand our guests and have a 2-way connection with them. And in addition to the fact that in less than 3 years, it's become one of the biggest retail loyalty programs in the United States with 100 million members and growing, it's also one of the new ways we're creating relevance at scale with a strategic shift from mass promotional offers to personalized.\nDuring holiday, personalized offers showed an $8 to $10 lift in promotional basket size compared to mass offers and a conversion rate of 70% versus 40%. In addition to the personalized deals curated for them and the fact that they can vote and support local nonprofits important to them, I have to call out our guests' love for Target Circle Bonus. Our new gamification platform personalizes missions and rewards members. And it's already delivering big for our business, resulting in nearly $200 million in incremental sales in 2021. And as you're hearing repeatedly today, we're just getting started.\nSo I've shared lots of examples about how we're meeting our guest needs and wants throughout their omnichannel journey, but this one stands out as a point of pride. In the past, we've been a Black History Month campaign for the month of February, but now through our digital platforms, we've grown towards an always-on, deeply relevant approach. So Target guests can shop and support Black-owned founders and entrepreneurs all year round through Black Beyond Measure and Latino-owned brands and women-owned brands and Asian-owned brands, and so many more personalized and inclusive experiences where guests feel seen and heard every day.\nHere's one more. Let's take a look at a new spot from our brand campaign, What We Value Most Shouldn't Cost More.\n(presentation)\nThere's a lot of good to see here. But it's not just what the guest sees, it's also about what's happening behind the scenes that makes all guests feel seen. We're partnering with diverse content creators in new ways from production crews to on-site catering in front of and behind the camera. Every part of the marketing ecosystem reflects our forward values. And this is so important. We are walking the walk in terms of our investments. By the end of the year, we're committing 5% of our annual media spend to Black-owned media partners and another 5% to Hispanic-owned media partners. Because equity opportunity and inclusivity are core to who we are, they show up authentically in our omnichannel experience, and our guests are responding to that.\nThis guest feels seen. In stationery, she feels a sense of belonging and inclusion when she holds a heartfelt message in Braille. And we brought him joy. Let's close with his journey.\n(presentation)\nSo no matter where you look in our omnichannel experience up at the Cat & Jack sign in store or online, the relevant connections we have with our guests are making a positive difference in their lives within our communities and for our business, and we're never going to stop.\nNow I'm delighted to introduce my friend and team member, John Mulligan.\n\nJohn J. Mulligan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Target Corporation\n\nWell, good morning, everybody. So I'm often asked how Target continues to operate within a challenging and volatile environment, putting growth on top of growth and building trust with our guests quarter after quarter. I could point to our agile supply chain, our hundreds of omnichannel stores, our industry-leading fulfillment capabilities and the operational algorithms that make it all work. But the real key to our continued growth is our global team and all the way they're using our resources and operations to take care of our guests.\nIn just the last 2 years, they've picked and packed 4x more items for same-day fulfillment, supported double-digit store traffic gains with a safe inspiring environment, opened over 60 new stores, remodeled hundreds more, and moved record levels of inventory to support our growing needs of our guests. Brian touched on how our Target team is showing up for each other and how that spirit of care starts here with our team and then extends to our guests and our communities. Our team is the connection across our business and the pulse of our operation, and I want to acknowledge their impact on how Target shows up today and how we'll continue to deliver in the future.\nThe power of our team is always visible in our stores, nearly 2,000 of them in neighborhoods across the country, serving as inspiring shopping destinations and local fulfillment hubs. Although the idea of leveraging stores to fulfill online orders is widely embraced across retail today, we are on our own when we introduced the concept 5 years ago. As a result, we're years ahead of others who just started using physical stores to meet digital demand. We know using stores as hubs would give guests more choice and convenience while giving our operation more flexibility and capacity for future growth. That was true prior to 2020 and could have not have been more essential since that time.\nToday, when our guests turn to Target, no matter how they choose to stop, those stores answer the call. Located just miles from most American homes, our stores handled more than 95% of the $100 billion plus in sales we did in 2021, including 12% more in-store traffic and most of our digital demand. Notably, more than half of those online sales were filled through our same-day services: Drive Up; Order Pick Up; and same-day delivery, which is Shipt. Our Chief Stores Officer, Mark Sindel, will share more shortly about how we'll keep investing in those services. They not only offer the quickest fulfillment at the lowest cost, their trip drivers that actually deepen guest engagement with Target. And on top of it all, they are the fastest-growing part of our business. This past year, they grew 45%, building on 235% growth in 2020, showing the continued guest appetite for fast and easy shopping.\nWith digital fulfillment growing exponentially and in-store traffic continuing to rise, our stores are supporting more and more volume. In the last 5 years, the average store has added $15 million in sales, which means $40 million stores have become $55 million to $60 million stores and growing. And as our stores become more productive, they naturally gain efficiencies, including significant cost leverage and lower clearance markdown rates. So as they contribute more to our top line, they further protect the bottom line.\nWe've said from the beginning that our stores have the capacity to support higher growth. That remains true today, even as average sales per store have risen 30% in just the last 2 years. But that enormous growth also means our operation is years ahead of where we had planned. So we're continuing to build upstream capacity we'll need over time. As we do, we're investing in ways that enable growth and move us toward our Target Forward sustainability commitments, from how we build and run our stores to the standards we hold for our vendor partners as well as how we will keep taking care of our team. We're continually strengthening an operation that supports a long future for Target and the world around us.\nOur investments in capacity start upstream and how we innovate within our supply chain to deliver on the growing need for inventory in our stores. Before last year, we hadn't added a new regional distribution center in over a decade, even as our total sales grew 40% over that same time period. Rather than add buildings, we grew by investing in automation, robotics and process design to improve the efficiency of our existing sites. Of course, we'll always keep investing to make our buildings more efficient. But with an additional $27 billion in sales over the last 2 years, we can't rely on that alone. It's time to expand our network.\nLast summer, we opened 2 new distribution facilities: 1 in New Jersey and 1 in Chicago. Today, we have 4 more currently in development that will open over the next few years with plans for several more to follow. Lighting up new buildings adds tremendous capacity to our supply chain network in support of our stores and will position Target to handle many more years of growth.\nAs we continue investing upstream from our stores, we're also innovating downstream with sortation centers to accelerate our last-mile capabilities. These centers help us further scale our stores as hub strategy and create room for future growth. The first of these facilities located not far from our headquarters in Minneapolis has been up and running for just over a year. Before it opened, our store teams would fulfill online orders and palletize the packages in the backroom, waiting for one daily pickup from our carrier partners. Now Target trucks collect those packages at our 40-plus Twin City stores throughout the day, keeping orders moving while giving stores more room to fill even more.\nThe packages arrive at the sortation center, where they're organized by ZIP Code and allocated to partners for direct delivery. Last spring, we integrated Shipt's last-mile delivery capabilities into the operation. Shipt drivers pick up a batch of orders sorted by neighborhood to make fast and efficient deliveries to our guests. Even during peak season, when most orders had a standard 2-day promise, these packages were delivered in just over a day on average. At the same time, the average unit fulfillment cost dropped by nearly 1/3, and that's before we've added automation that will make these buildings more productive in the future.\nOur Minneapolis pilot shows how sortation centers will make stores even more efficient as fulfillment hubs and allow us to roll out a next-day delivery capability at scale. We started to expand this concept into other densely populated markets. By the end of next month, we'll have 5 more centers up and running from Dallas to Philadelphia with another 5 planned in additional metro areas later this year.\nThis capability isn't something we built overnight. It's the result of many strategic decisions we've made over time, working together in a model that's unique to Target. It works hand in glove with our stores-as-hub strategy. It leans on technology we acquired and further developed through Grand Junction and Deliv to optimize the most efficient route for every package. And it's unlocked by integrating Shipt's delivery capability into our last-mile operation. Our sortation center expansion will add meaningful speed and efficiency to our fulfillment capabilities so we can field continued growth for the long term.\n(presentation)\nThe ongoing investments in our supply chain are designed to keep our stores at the center of how we serve our guests. Just as important are the continued investments we make in the physical stores themselves. Since 2017, we've completed top-to-bottom remodels across nearly half our chain, bringing even more inspiration to the store environment while helping our team more effectively support online fulfillment.\nThis year, we'll remodel around 200 stores and keep that pace in the years that follow. And these aren't the same remodels we are rolling out when we started. Each year, our architects and construction crews update our plans to keep raising the bar on retail design. And our guests continue to tell us they like what they see. Following a remodel, traffic gains across the store helped drive an average 2% to 4% sales lift in year 1 and another 1% to 2% lift in year 2.\nAs our full store program continues, we'll also invest in hundreds of smaller projects to support growing in-store partnerships, including Ulta Beauty, Disney and Starbucks, and they make store fulfillment even easier for our team. As we invest in existing -- in our existing store portfolio, we'll continue to open around 30 new stores a year. For the better part of the last decade, our store growth has been driven by small formats. With a more flexible footprint, these stores have enabled us to enter new markets and reach more guests.\nThis year, we'll keep going, opening doors in iconic sites, from the historic streets of Charleston, South Carolina to the Buzz Energy of Times Square. At the same time, small isn't always got planned. But our store is now more productive than ever. There are benefits to a bigger box. And given the favorable real estate market, these sites are available at attractive deals. I'm not talking about our largest store formats, though they continue to do extremely well for us. I'm talking about midsized stores, 2 to 3x bigger than our small formats. These sites are built in dense neighborhoods with enough room for a traditional store experience and digital fulfillment, helping us bring Target closer to even more guests.\nThis versatility is another example of how we built a flexible operation to support our growth. Ten years ago, we designed and built 2 store formats: large and larger. Today, we have the opportunity to open and operate stores in spaces of any size so we can meet our guests wherever they are. This year, we'll open stores ranging from 14,000 square feet to 10x that size, using that flexibility to design shopping experiences that best meet the needs of each local community.\nAnd before I hand it over to Mark, I'll close with how I started with our team. You heard it from Brian and Jen, our store director in Wisconsin, \"We're still in the early days of our growth strategy.\" And it's our team, continuing to accelerate capabilities and build trust with our guests that will keep Target growing well into the future. As we've invested in their growth, from wages and benefits that you heard about today, to education, skill training and career progression, internal surveys show our team's engagement, morale and confidence in Target's future remain strong. That stability has led to better guest service, more collaboration, and as Brian said, a finer ability to flex, adapt and navigate the new challenges of being a bigger, stronger Target.\nWhen we take care of our team, they take care of our guests, proof that Target's culture will power our strategy to deliver ease, inspiration and joy for our guests for years to come. Take a look.\n(presentation)\n\nMark J. Schindele\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Stores Officer, Target Corporation",
    "content2": "Good morning, everyone. One of the best parts about my job is getting to spend time with our team every week in stores across the country. And I hear stories like those we just shared in the video, stories about what Target means to our team. And there's no doubt that our more than 300,000 store team members who interact with our guests every day are Target's biggest asset and our single-greatest differentiator. They inspire me as they bring our purpose to life every single day.\nAnd I'm excited to talk about them and what they do, including ways that may not show up on the balance sheet. Take Terence, for example. He's a team member in our Fairview Heights, Illinois store who stopped what he was doing to help change a guest's flat tire in our parking lot. Her response, \"He's my hero. I'll be looking for him every time I go in that store just to tell him how special he is.\" Or Manu, a leader in our Maui store, who helped the elderly community in the remote town of Hana. She partnered with a local nonprofit to help them get the essentials they needed when they couldn't make it to the store in person.\nOur team is there to help our guests every day, handing them clean cards as they walk in our front doors, helping them find that perfect item on the shelf, dropping their bags into their car or shipping orders out the back to their homes. They show up for local communities and each other day in and day out. And that's why when we set out to put our stores at the heart of everything we do, it was clear that the most important investment we could make was in our team.\nWe know an engaged team is more productive and creates a better experience for our guests. And over the last year, we've invested in wages, debt-free education and made even more of our team eligible for health benefits. We've also focused on desired hours and more reliable schedules through one-on-one conversations with our team, and we have an ongoing commitment to develop our team to get to wherever they want to go.\nWe've also seen great growth in our new on-demand scheduling option we introduced this year, with more than 35,000 team members already signed up. It's a perfect opportunity for those team members who mainly want a couple of shifts a month or a college student who wants to work over the holiday season when she's back over winter break. Together, our investments and consistent hours for our team and the flexibility of on-demand models help us deliver for our guests while supporting the diverse needs of our team.\nEven as the U.S. labor market is seeing some of the highest turnover on record, our rate in Target stores remains below pre-pandemic levels. Our stores are fully staffed, and we've been able to leverage the training and the tenure of our team to easily shift against demand without missing a beat.\nLet's talk about the experience we're delivering for our guests. Target is the easiest place for our guests to get everything they need, no matter how they choose to shop. Even in a year as unpredictable as 2021, we saw satisfaction rise with gains in many of our most important drivers of guest experience, like interacting with our team on the sales floor and wait time at checkout. In fact, over the past 2 years, our already impressive overall Net Promoter Score increased more than 10%, a true testament to our team's commitment to service.\nIn every store from the register of the Drive Up plan, our team is building loyalty with guests, offering ease, convenience and incredible service that keeps them coming back. For example, more than 60% of our new Drive Up guests return to use it again that month. And when a guest tries a new same-day service for the first time, they spend more target going forward, including in our stores. And last year, more than half of our digital sales came from our same-day services.\nIn the year ahead, we'll fuel that momentum, deepening our trust with our guests with an experience our competitors can't match. That means clean, bright and owned brand floors that invite discovery, inspire guests with the latest products, all brought to life by an incredible team, a team that's empowered and trained across the building so they can jump in wherever our guests need us.\nAnd we've developed a flexible framework of service so every single team member can engage and connect and problem-solve with guests across the store. We'll continue to backup train every new team member on same-day services so we can easily adjust for peaks and in-store pickup. And we're offering continuous learning and development moments throughout the year in key categories and new brands.\nWe know operational excellence and service go hand in hand so we're focused on nailing the fundamentals and making shopping at Target easy and special for our guests. Take a look.\n(presentation)\nIn nearly 2,000 communities across the country, our Target team provides great in-store experience and easy fulfillment options. With same-day services already at scale from coast to coast, we are ready for when guest shopping behavior changed. And as we've seen demand grow, our team is able to support that growth and accelerate our progress to meet guest needs along the way.\nIn the past year, we've added adult beverage and expanded our assortment for pickup. We built in more personalized features like sending a friend or a family member when plans change. Choosing where you'd like your order placed in your car or selecting a backup option of some things out of stock. We even doubled the amount of Drive Up parking spaces in the holiday season so guests could get those last-minute gifts without leaving their cars.\nOur guests love our same-day services, and they provide great cost savings of nearly 90% per unit compared to shipping from an upstream warehouse. In the year ahead, we'll keep improving Order Pickup and Drive Up offerings with a focus on quality, speed and great service. We'll continue to expand the assortment available, and we'll add the Backup Item functionality to even more categories. In the months since we rolled out this option, our teams are able to substitute the Backup Items 98% of the time.\nEverything we do at Target is grounded in making our guests' daily lives even easier. We want every Target run to be fast, convenient and rewarding, and that includes the return process. Our teams are building the capability to accept returns from the Drive Up lane with plans to test later this year. So guests will be able to check everything out their shopping list and return a product that wasn't quite right at the same time and without leaving the car.\nAnd lastly, I'm really excited we're going to pilot the ability to order Starbucks for Drive Up so guests can get everything on their list and request their morning late when they're on the way while never even unbuckling their seatbelt. We'll take a test-and-learn approach in select markets throughout the summer and fall with a goal of eventually making this option available from coast to coast.\nDuring these enhancements to life and continue strengthening our operations, our team is working to streamline on the back end, even further integrating the omnichannel experience into how we run and staff our stores. Now of course, nothing at Target happens in a vacuum. So we're working with partners from across the organization from tech and digital to supply chain and properties to support these capabilities. The ability of our store teams to ship local orders out our back doors continues to increase our speed to guests while delivering cost savings of more than 40% per unit versus upstream shipping.\nWe're working closely with our supply chain partners as we roll out more sortation centers across the country. As you heard from John, we're excited about the efficiencies they'll continue adding to our ship-from-store operation. Frequent sweeps of our stores to a local sortation center frees up space in our backrooms, and centralizing the sorting process helps our team be more productive and saves valuable time.\nOur teams are focused on greater ease and efficiency with store staffing, especially when it comes to same-day options, so we can be ready to flex with guest demand. We're enhancing our technology to give store leaders an even clear real-time picture of fulfillment needs and testing out new tools to help them better predict guest patterns in the future, helping us be even more efficient in staffing, the right teams at the right times, ready to do the work and deliver for our guests.\nWe're making upgrades to physical spaces that support these services, remodeling our stores with more hold capacity, adding dedicated doors with easy access to the exterior. We're adding more Drive Up spaces to our parking lots, and we're even adding some camps in stores that get bad weather. Also our teams can get orders to guests quickly and safely every time.\nAnd inside our stores, we're making improvements to the process itself to make things even easier for our team and better for our guests, like finding the most efficient ways to pick orders from how we deploy the team members, to technology that helps reduce footsteps throughout the store, all with the goal of continuing to deliver the ease and convenience our guests expect.\nOur solid operational foundation and stores-as-hub model has allowed Target to be there for our guests even when the world shifted around us, and they'll continue to be the engines of our growth. That foundation is made even stronger by the deep roots of empathy and care and everything our teams do to keep us moving forward together.\nAnd before I turn it over to Rick, I can't miss the opportunity to say thank you to our team. With stores at the center of how we serve guests across the country, they've risen to every challenge with care, resilience and flexibility, not only meeting guest needs today but ensuring we'll be ready for them tomorrow. Thank you.\n\nRichard H. Gomez\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Food & Beverage Officer, Target Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. I am proud to be here today representing Target's Food & Beverage team because getting to $20 billion in sales last year, delivering double-digit growth on top of 2020's double-digit growth, achieving millions of dollars in market share gains and becoming America's fourth-biggest digital grocer and being named Retailer of the Year by Supermarket News, well, none of that happened by chance.\nAs some of you know, we've been on a journey when it comes to groceries at Target. Food has always played an important role in driving trips and basket size, but we knew we could do so much more in this space. Today, Target is a company that doesn't just sell food. We are a company that celebrates food with a grocery business that's driving trips and basket size, and even more importantly, loyalty. It's become part of the differentiated experience that separates Target from the pack.\nNow before joining Target's marketing team back in 2013, I spent my entire career working for iconic food and beverage brands. That experience taught me that food and beverage is a business that is deeply personal for consumers, and that's what our team is delivering at Target. Central to our success is the fact that what we're doing is 100% unapologetically Target. That means we're not copying competitors or trying to do something we're not. Instead, we're listening to our guests, and we're leaning into what's special about Target: to provide a better experience at a great value. That's led to amazing results, a deeper sense of loyalty from our guests and the opportunity to do even more.\nA great example of this is our digital business. It's hard to believe, but just 2 years ago, fresh and frozen Order Pickup in-store and curbside was just a small test in a few markets. But when the pandemic hit, we knew we had to accelerate our plans to meet guests' fast-pacing changing needs. So in a matter of just a few months, we installed refrigerators and freezers for order pickup in hundreds of stores nationwide. We trained thousands of team members to pick online grocery orders. And we rolled out new marketing to raise awareness that if you're looking for safe, quick, easy option for getting your groceries and essentials, that's, by the way, free with no order minimum requirement, well, then Target is your place.\nWhen you think about the power of team, there are a few better examples than how in the middle of the pandemic and the miss of peak-level sales, we mobilized teams from across the company to undertake this monumental body of work because it was the right thing to do for our guests, and it was the right thing to do for our business. It really has been a game changer for so many families looking to limit trips outside their homes and into stores. And it has revolutionized our food and beverage experience, turning Target into an omnichannel grocery powerhouse.\nAnd we'll continue to make our pickup service even better. For instance, since launching Fresh and Frozen Pickup, we've also added Adult Beverage Pickup to about 80% of our stores. And I am so excited about what Mark just shared with Starbucks as part of our Drive Up experience.\nBut it's important to recognize that there's still a lot of potential in front of us. But even as guests have started reclaiming some of their routines, including making more trips into our target stores, our digital business, fueled by Shipt and our Order Pickup services, continues to grow.\nLook at the numbers. At the end of 2019, our digital penetration in Food & Beverage was 2.3%. We ended 2020 at 9.6%. We closed 2021 at 13.2%. Our 2021 digital sales were up $900 million over 2020 and up by sixfold over 2019. Our Net Promoter Scores consistently show that guests love our digital services. So as we keep driving awareness and trial and adding new experiences, we anticipate continued growth.\nAnother area we're driving awareness and trial has led to ongoing growth is in our owned brand assortment. Back in 2019, we rolled out our flagship-owned brand, Good & Gather. It was the largest owned brand launch ever. Today, it totals nearly 2,500 items across Food & Beverage and is helping change perceptions about the shopping experience at Target. It's affordable, it's delicious, and it's on trend. Whether you're looking for a quick easy Tuesday night dinner or something fun for entertaining during March Madness, Good & Gather is everything our guests have long expected from Target's owned brands. And today, its growth is outpacing the industry average for private-label brands.\nAnd there's more. Favorite Day, a new brand of craveable baked goods, it treats that draws guests into the food aisles. For instance, some of you might have come to Target because their kindergartner lost a sneaker and she has gym class tomorrow. But while dad's there, he might as well reward himself with a container of peanut butter Monster Trail mix for the home office.\nNow Target-owned brands are only part of the story. We are also elevating our assortment by diversifying our assortment because we know that representation is critical to ensuring that we are -- that our offering is relevant to all our guests. Now when we decided at the beginning of last year to accelerate our commitment to adding more Black-owned brands, we had a dozen in our Food & Beverage assortment. But by changing the way we work, working hard to build new relationships and by using our size and scale to help brands grow for success in mass retail, we'll end 2022 with more than 50 Black-owned brands in our Food & Beverage assortment.\nAnd we won't stop there. Because these brands don't just make us more relevant, they make our assortment better. A great example is McBride Sisters wine, a Black female-owned business. We actually started working with them back in 2018 with a small partnership in about 100 stores in the South. Today, McBride Sisters is available in over 1,200 stores; or Everything Legendary, a company one of our buyers saw on television and couldn't wait to work with. So the next morning, he picked up the phone, sparking a relationship that led to Everything Legendary becoming Target's first Black-owned, plant-based meat supplier.\nAnd Target has taken a strong position in coffee, a category where our guests have especially high expectations. Black & Bold is a 3.5-year-old company founded by 2 childhood friends, and they have put social impact at the center of their business model, giving 5% of their profit to support kids and underserved communities. It's a company that we knew is a perfect fit for Target. They were our first Black-owned coffee brand. Today -- well, today, they're available in 1,300 stores and online. The response has been amazing. I love the suite.\nNow you got to go to Target and by a Keurig and the Black-owned coffee, Black and Bold. That tweet also brings me to another key differentiator in Target: the role we play as part of Target's multi-category assortment. That's something that sets Target apart on everyday trips and especially around holidays and key seasonal moments. Target dominates holiday seasons because guests love that they can get everything they need at Target; Halloween candy and costumes; the Thanksgiving turkey and games for the kids while the adults are gathering in the kitchen or watching football; and of course, everything you need to make Hannukah, Christmas, Kwanza, 3 Kings Day special, including our robust selection of gingerbread houses.\nAnd this trend is continuing in 2022 as we saw during the first big seasonal moment of this year, Valentine's Day. Through the power of the total Target experience, the way we innovate, including our new Favorite Day, Valentine's Sugar Cookie Kids, building on Target's cachet and the gingerbread space and the platform we provide for our national brand partners to do amazing things to grow their brands, our team came through with the kind of Valentine's Day experience that makes Target special. In fact, we delivered our biggest Valentine's Candy sales ever, and we did it by the close of business on February 13. We did it with a day to spare. And we reached another milestone on February 13, finishing the week with record sales for snacks ahead of the Super Bowl.\nAnd despite all of this, what's so exciting to our team is that there's still a lot of room for us to improve, grow and gain even more market share in food for years to come. For instance, our research shows that even our best guests underestimate the breadth of our assortment, thinking we can only get some of their groceries at Target. As we continue to raise awareness of our full offering and we get credit for what we are already doing and the value that we provide, well, that is a huge opportunity.\nYou heard Christina talk earlier about accessibility and affordability. That's why the Digital Snap payment option we're rolling out this year is so important to Food & Beverage. It's going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries. And as we move more product faster than ever through our distribution network, we are continuing to look for ways to move that product even faster. Some of our improvement will come from the way we work with our national brand suppliers, encouraging them to prioritize the growth opportunity that Target represents. We're also working to better utilize our food distribution centers to keep up with the fast-growing demand.\nWe'll continue leveraging the power of our owned brands for everyday needs and big seasonal moments. And I'm excited that for the first time, we're going to have a holiday-themed Favorite Day assortment this year.\nAnd then there's Circle. It's especially crucial to what we're doing in food, raising awareness of our assortment and the value that we offer. As you heard from Cara, we are not done growing what's already one of America's biggest and most vibrant loyalty programs. And as our marketing team continues to build on the success of Circle, that's going to help our entire business, but especially Food & Beverage.\nWe have a lot to be proud of. And there's a lot of opportunity, and yes, a lot of work in front of us. But when I think about the future, I'd say my optimism is rooted in our team. So before handing off to Michael, I'll close with one more thought on team. Over the last couple of years, we've hired scores of Food & Beverage directors and coordinators, people with immense expertise in the grocery industry who are helping us drive continuous improvement across our operations. A few weeks ago, I was visiting stores in Colorado, and I was talking to one of our coordinators, Bridget. I asked her why she joined Target. Now keep in mind, this is someone who joined us from another retailer, someone who already had a good job and was doing well in her career. But when I posed this question, the first thing she said goes to what Brian was talking about in his intro, she talked about culture. Bridget was willing to take a risk in her career to leave a situation that was pretty good and give Target a chance because of what she heard about being a part of this team.\nShe told me a lot about the people she works with, the support she has to make decisions that are right for the guest and the partnership she has with team members working in other categories. Bridge told me it was everything I hope for and more. In this environment, the race for talent is just as intense as the race for sales. But every day, people are opting in to be a part of the Target team. Because of what we have already achieved? Absolutely, but even more so because of the possibility of what we can do going forward. I'm just as proud of that and inspired by that as I am of any of the numbers that we've shared today. Because when I think about everything in front of us, team members like Bridget and the human touch and the guest focus that our entire team brings to their work, well, that is what it's going to ensure that our guests can always count on Target.\nThank you so much. And now I'll hand things over to Michael.\n\nMichael J. Fiddelke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Target Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick. At the top of the meeting, Brian shared some of the key milestones from the last 5 years. And I'd like to begin my remarks today by highlighting one more, which is the long-term financial algorithm we unveiled during that time. You'll recall that the prior algorithm anticipated low single-digit sales growth, mid-single-digit operating income growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, after tax ROIC in the mid- to high teens.\nIn the 2 years leading up to the pandemic, our business was consistently generating top line performance in line with the algorithm as we saw average sales growth of 3.7% in 2018 and 2019. And on the bottom line during that period, our business grew somewhat ahead of the algorithm with average adjusted EPS growth of 16.7% over those 2 years and an average after-tax ROIC of 15.4%.\nSince the beginning of 2020, COVID has changed nearly every aspect of consumers' lives, and we've all seen its impact on the retail industry. At Target, our team and durable model navigated these changes incredibly well, advancing our business far ahead of expectations. Simply put, over the last 2 years, our financial performance blew away the prior algorithm from top to bottom. And today, we're a much larger retailer, generating industry-leading returns on capital.\nAs we enter 2020, things remain far from ordinary, but a future beyond this volatile time is taking shape. And given the durable and sustainable model we've built and the ongoing investments we're making, we've updated our financial algorithm, which will define our long-term expectations beginning next year, in 2023, and beyond. This updated algorithm demonstrates our confidence in Target's ability to continue growing on top of the incredible expansion over the last couple of years.\nSpecifically, over time, our updated long-term algorithm anticipates mid-single-digit annual growth in both total revenue and operating income, high single-digit annual growth in adjusted EPS, annual CapEx of $4 billion to $5 billion, after-tax ROIC in the high 20% to 30% range. Compared with our prior algorithm, this new one leans more into growth driven primarily by comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores and continued growth from other revenue sources. Our confidence in Target's ability to continue growing is based on all of the initiatives you've heard about today, which are designed to drive engagement, traffic and market share gains, including new stores; remodels; national brand partnerships and owned brand innovations; expansion of our same-day services; growth of new and emerging revenue sources; further rollout of sortation centers; continued investments in value and affordability; leveraging guest insights to enhance our assortment and promotions while personalizing the guest experience; elevating guest service through investments in the team, training and technology, all while investing in Target Forward, to enhance the long-term sustainability of the business and the planet.\nSince today is the first time we've included other revenue in our top line guidance, I want to pause and cover some of what's reflected in that line of the P&L and what's been driving its growth. And while there are many smaller items represented on this slide, profit-sharing income on our credit card portfolio has historically accounted for more than half of it. But in recent years, Round Dell has been the primary growth driver of this slide, causing it to become its second-largest component. I want to emphasize, however, that Rounddell's impact extends well beyond the amount reflected on this slide alone as a meaningful portion of Roundie's income reduces our cost of sales, benefiting our gross margin. Among other notable drivers, Shipt membership fees are included on this line, along with the fees we received from third-party vendors on Target Plus, which are expected to grow over time.\nMoving to the operating income line, you'll note that our long-term growth expectations are consistent with the prior algorithm, but we don't rely on rate expansion to get there. Now I should quickly point out, we'll happily welcome rate expansion when it happens for the right reasons, including the massive scale benefits we've realized over the last 2 years. But as I've said many times, given that we're focused on maximizing profit dollar growth, our plans account for the inherent trade-off between profit rates and top line growth. Put another way, a durable business model anticipates the need for continual investments to deliver sustainable growth. As such, we've built an algorithm based on driving and harvesting continued efficiencies in our business and continually reinvesting those savings in growth that further differentiates Target through our team, our stores and the entire guest experience.\nAmong the factors that will drive our operating margin rate over time, we expect the headwinds and tailwinds will generally balance each other out. On the gross margin line, those factors include merchandise mix, channel mix and merchandising strategies. On the SG&A line, cost leverage, efficiency gains and team investments are most notable. On the D&A line, leverage and accelerated depreciation are the primary drivers. Also consistent with the prior algorithm, this updated one anticipates high single-digit growth in adjusted EPS driven by mid-single-digit growth in operating income combined with the benefit of continued share repurchases.\nMoving on to capital deployment. I want to first reiterate our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. Our top priority is to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. We then look to support the dividend and build on our 50-year record of consecutive annual dividend increases. And finally, when we have capacity beyond those first 2 uses, we repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\nBeginning with investments in our business. We expect ongoing CapEx will be in the $4 billion to $5 billion range annually, and we'll be focused first on our continued investments in our stores-as-hubs model, including new locations, full store remodels, fulfillment retrofits and projects to support key national brand partnerships. In addition, as John outlined, we'll continue to invest in our upstream supply chain, sortation centers and DC automation to further reduce store workload.\nEven after these sizable and CapEx investments, we expect to have ample capacity for shareholder returns as well given the robust operating cash flow our business continues to generate, amounting to more than $8.5 billion in 2021. We'll maintain our focus on growing the annual dividend, something we've accomplished for 50 consecutive years and look to maintain a 40% payout ratio over time. In addition, given our expectation for continued strong cash generation by our business, we'll have the capacity to return capital through share repurchases within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\nFinally, the most dramatic change from our prior algorithm pertains to our after-tax ROIC, where our updated range of expectations is 10-plus percentage points higher than before. This change highlights the asset efficiency of our stores-as-hubs model, which has unlocked the full potential of our store locations to flexibly serve our guests. With this model, our business has generated revenue growth of more than 35% or nearly $28 billion over the last 2 years, largely on the existing asset base.\nNow I want to move on to expectations for this year. As I step back and think about where we are and where we've been, it's clear we're still in the midst of the pandemic, but we've entered a new phase. In this phase, we're still facing multiple challenges and uncertainties, including a tight labor market and persistent supply chain bottlenecks, which are contributing to higher inflation rates than we've seen in decades. And beyond those ongoing challenges, we'll soon get to see how the consumer and economy moved beyond government stimulus as we compare over the large first quarter packages that benefited consumers both in 2020 and again last year.\nHowever, the last couple of years have also proven the durability and flexibility of our business and financial model. Specifically, relying on stores as fulfillment hubs allows our team to conveniently and efficiently serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. This includes our suite of same-day services, which differentiate Target and provide a reliable, fast and easy shopping experience. Our model features a unique brand and balanced merchandise -- broad and balanced merchandise assortment, allowing us to serve guests and drive trips to serve a wide variety of wants and needs. And our long history of investing in value and affordability, which has long been a key differentiator, becomes even more important in an inflationary environment.\nAs a result, with a proven model and the multiple growth investments we've highlighted today, we expect to continue growing the top line in 2022, generating a low to mid-single-digit increase in revenue on top of historically strong growth over the last 2 years. On the operating margin line this year, we're planning to deliver a rate of 8% or higher, reflecting several deliberate rate investments to position our business for long-term profitable growth.\nFirst on that list are continued investments in pay and benefits to support our team as we build on the enormous progress we've made over the past few years. Beyond the team, this year's investments in growth capacity will drive some rate pressure. And we're planning for a small increase in markdown rates in 2022 as we move past the dramatically low rates we've seen over the last couple of years. Finally, and importantly, we'll continue to focus on value and affordability in this inflationary environment. That means taking a thoughtful long-term approach to pricing decisions, ensuring that we deliver unbeatable value for our guests.\nWe have many levers to combat costs, and price is the one we pull last, not first. As a result, product costs within our assortment have risen faster than retails in recent quarters, reflecting this intentional approach in deliberate pacing. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the first half of this year as we maintain our focus on affordability for our guests. Altogether, given our expectations for revenue growth and purposeful operating margin rate investments, we're positioned to deliver low single-digit growth in operating income dollars this year.\nConsistent with the longer term, we expect CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range this year. This range is wider than we typically see at this point of the year given continued delays in receiving fixtures and equipment, along with permitting and inspection delays in local communities. Put another way, our hope is to be at the top end of this range in 2022, but it's possible that external factors will continue to affect certain projects.\nRegarding the dividend, later this year, we plan to recommend that our Board approve a per-share dividend increase in the 20% to 30% range as we continue to move toward a 40% payout ratio over time. In addition, given our current cash position and expectations for strong cash flow, we believe our 2022 share repurchases will be at or above the $7 billion we accomplished in 2021.\nPutting all of our expectations together, a low to mid-single-digit revenue increase, an operating margin rate of 8% or higher and continued robust share repurchase activity, we're positioned to generate high single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this year on top of a 112% increase over the last 2 years.\nWhile I'm not going to provide detailed quarterly guidance today, I want to pause and talk about how our 2022 profit performance is expected to play out within the year given some of the unique factors involved. Specifically, in the front half of this year, we'll be annualizing last year's government stimulus while facing ongoing supply chain pressures and other cost increases. In contrast, as the year progresses, we'll begin comping over the period of higher costs that emerged in the back half of last year, while our supply chain and merchandising strategies have more time to adjust. As such, we expect our quarterly profit performance will be choppy during the year and generally improve as the year progresses.\nQ1 provides a timely example. This chart shows the variability of our Q1 profit rate over the last 3 years. Looking ahead, we expect our first quarter 2022 rate will move to something that's relatively high to our history but well below last year's 9.8% rate, which was unusually high due to some unique factors.\nAs I get ready to close my remarks, I want to pause and spend a minute talking about the key role that efficiency and disciplined expense management have played in our recent success and how we're committed to maintaining that discipline going forward. And while I can provide many examples of our team's cost discipline, I want to focus on a couple of notable ones.\nFirst on that list are meaningful efficiency gains we've realized in digital fulfillment across each of our digital fulfillment nodes. From package delivery to in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, we've implemented multiple processes and process improvements and rolled out new technology to remove costs and increase speed to our guests. As a result, over the last 3 years, our average per unit digital fulfillment costs have declined by more than 50%, reflecting both efficiency gains and the benefit of mix as our most efficient same-day services have become a bigger and bigger portion of our digital sales.\nLooking ahead, the rollout of sortation centers presents a compelling opportunity to further reduce the unit cost of last-mile delivery. As John mentioned, in the Twin Cities market, where we've been piloting our first sortation center, we've seen our average per unit last-mile fulfillment costs go down by nearly 1/3.\nThe second example I want to highlight is the enormous benefit we've realized from the investments we've been making in our team. These investments have driven positive change to the lives of hundreds of thousands of team members, offering more steady income, pathways to career growth and education and access to benefits that meet their evolving needs. But these investments are delivering efficiency and growth in our business as well. A portion of these gains come directly from the fact that with high retention rates and improved training, our team can accomplish tasks more efficiently than in the past.\nBut that's just the beginning. Because of our investments in the team, they're continually delivering higher levels of service, building on the trust we've established with our guests. This results in higher satisfaction scores, higher engagements and more return visits. And with higher service levels, Target becomes a more attractive partner for leading national brands, enabling partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Apple, Disney and Levi's.\nOnce you've accounted for all of the efficiency and top line benefits that have come from our team investments, you can see why I reiterate time and time again that caring for and investing in our team is the best long-term investment we can make in our business. In fact, whether I'm looking at these investments as the CFO or through the lens of my earlier role supporting stores are leading pay and benefits for our HR team, the lessons are consistent. Whether you're talking about physical capital or human capital, underinvesting might lead to great-looking results over a very short period, but they're not sustainable over time.\nSo before I close, I want to pause and express my gratitude to our team, many of whom are listening into this meeting today. You have delivered industry-leading results over the last couple of years while taking care of our guests and each other. And importantly, during that time, you've made Target a much stronger company, positioning us to deliver sustainable, profitable growth from a significantly larger retail platform.\nI want to thank you all on behalf of all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian C. Cornell\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Target Corporation\n\nWe began this meeting talking about our path, 5 years, from $70 billion to $106 billion. We took you through our present, our strengths, our enablers and our culture of care. Now I'd like to talk about our future. We see a growth horizon for years to come. We will continue to invest in our strategies. We'll continue to invest and our capabilities. We'll continue to nurture a team that cares, cares about work that has purpose, cares about work that has meaning. We are growing teams that embrace our commitment to their career growth and development, our commitment to competitive pay and benefits, our commitment to being a premier American brand, our commitment to growing teams that care.\nYes, we have the team and we have the strategy. We are 100% focused on the needs of American consumers. We have some of the most innovative and guest-centric capabilities in retail. We have a balance sheet that is the envy of the industry. And we have a record of cash generation you can count on, provide incredible value to our stakeholders.\nYes, as we look at the growth horizon in front of us, we see many opportunities. As we move forward, we'll stay focused on helping our guests navigate through continued uncertainty with what's happening in the world around us, the pandemic and the macroeconomic environment. This includes the highest inflation in decades and the gradual loosening of supply chain bottlenecks. We'll stay focused on delivering value and affordability to our guests. We know how to deliver exceptional value and manage profitability. We can protect prices whenever possible. We can offer an unbeatable range of owned and national brands across our portfolio categories. We can make value into our assortment, and we'll work with our vendor partners from sourcing to production to shipping. We'll ensure that those prices we offer will always be among the best in American retail.\nWe have a strong record of thoughtful investment in supply chain and innovation. We provide a competitive advantage by keeping our stores stocked and our digital orders filled. We have the flexibility we need to contain with constraints so we can keep growing and thriving in any environment. And above all, we have the team.\nA few days ago, I visited several Minnesota stores. I was impressed with the Ulta Beauty displays, with our Disney shops, with our Apple stores, but what impressed me most was a team member who came up to me and said, \"Brian, I'm so proud to be working at Target. I'm proud of how you're handling the pandemic. I'm proud to be part of the Target team.\" We have a team that's committed to making target of the future even better, the Target of the future even stronger and the Target of the future even more caring.\nFor everyone who's listening today, including our teams across the globe, no, we're already working to determine the best way to support humanitarian efforts for the people of Ukraine. As we have throughout the last couple of years, we'll rally our team, put our resources to work to support families through these challenging times.\nAnd with that, I'm going to ask all of our speakers to join me on stage, and we'll start taking your questions.",

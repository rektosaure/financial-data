Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeni Dominguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeni Dominguez\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon. and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we'll move on to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause or actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeni. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported strong second quarter results, which reflect sustained momentum in our business and the strength of our diversified portfolio. Consolidated revenues in the quarter increased 10% year-over-year to $103 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 39% to $9.86. These results demonstrate the impact of focused execution across the enterprise with notably 3 of our segments delivering double-digit adjusted operating profit growth as we continue to deliver against our strategic priorities. .\nGiven our first half performance and our confidence in the outlook for the year, we are raising our guidance on adjusted earnings per diluted share to $38.35 to $38.85. This builds on the $0.80 increase announced at our Investor Day in September. At the event, we also affirmed our company priorities and highlighted the differentiated capabilities that underpin McKesson's long-term growth.\nI'll walk you through our continued progress we achieved in the second quarter. At that conference, we also introduced our new reporting structure that sharpens our strategic alignment and provides enhanced transparency into the growth areas of our business. The newly formed Oncology and Multi-specialty segment will focus on accelerating our strategy in the higher growth, higher-margin segments. And we established a North American Pharmaceutical segment, bringing together our pharmaceutical distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Canada.\nThis quarter marks our first set of results under this structure and I'm pleased with how our teams have come together to deliver consistent financial performance. We are confident that the new reporting structure will optimize our portfolio management and drive sustainable long-term value creation for shareholders. Britt will share more about the quarterly results in his remarks. But let me start by talking in a minute about our people and culture.\nTeam McKesson is the driving force for the continued innovation and excellence. It's the foundation of everything that we accomplish. Our best talent strategy continues to raise the bar across McKesson and is evident in the way our teams and our Board approach service, integrity, teamwork and performance. That commitment is exemplified by our Chairman of the Board, Don Knauss, who was recently honored with the B Kenneth West Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Association of Corporate Directors.\nThis is a well-earned recognition of his leadership, and I am grateful for his many, many contributions to McKesson. We believe that a strong culture is an integral part of our talent strategy, and it's reflected in how we support our communities and our people. In September, McKesson team members came together to participate in our annual community impact days. We supported more than 60 organizations nationwide, giving back to our communities and reinforcing the values that drive our everyday work.\nWe support and care for our people through extensive resources and programs. And in October, employees across McKesson took part in our Annual Wellness Day, we refer to it as Your day, Your Way. It's now in its fifth year and it underscores our continuing commitment to our team's well-being.\nLet's move on to our 2 strategic growth pillars: oncology and multi-specialty and our biopharma services. Our differentiated specialty platform remains a central pillar of our growth strategy and is now reported within the newly established oncology and multi-specialty segment. Our differentiated capabilities have us well positioned to advance cancer care and expand into other therapeutic areas through scale, connectivity and innovation.\nFoundational to our oncology and multispecialty business is our unparalleled distribution breadth. Specialty is a growing market with many unique medications and distribution requirements. We have market-leading capabilities and scale through our strong presence in the community provider setting, serving more than 14,000 providers across a wide range of specialties.\nComplementary to the core distribution capabilities are our group purchasing organization, specialty pharmacy offerings and infusion management services. Our diverse capabilities enable us to support a wide range of customers with varying needs and accessing specialty meds, including innovative therapies that are transforming care. This includes the launch and commercialization of cell and gene therapies. In August, we launched InspiroCare, a patient hub designed to simplify the complex journey of cell and gene therapies and provide personalized compassionate support for patients.\nIn September, we opened a world-class cold chain facility dedicated to cell and gene therapy distribution. This 12,000-foot facility is equipped with ultra frozen and cryogenic storage technology, specifically designed for the unique requirements of these medications, ensuring proper storage and the highest standards of compliance and care.\nOur best-in-class oncology platform provides support to community providers through a comprehensive suite of services, including practice management, clinical trial access and industry-leading technology solutions that empower them to deliver world-class care. The U.S. oncology network has been leading the cancer care transformation for more than 15 years and is now supporting over 3,300 providers across more than 700 sites across the country.\nIn October, the U.S. oncology network formed a collaboration with Blood Cancer united around a shared goal of strengthening cancer care and access to clinical trials close to home. The collaboration will provide personalized clinical trial education as well as clinical trial matching through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. It will also offer patient navigation services to facilitate participation in clinical trials for patients with all types of blood cancer.\nDuring the second quarter, progress continued with the integration of Florida Cancer Specialists and PRISM Vision, bringing both practice groups onto our distribution and GPO agreements to unlock the full value of our broader services and take advantage of the expanded relationships.\nPRISM Vision recently expanded its footprint with the addition of Spokane Eye clinic located in Spokane, Washington, extending its reach now beyond the Mid-Atlantic region. Spokane Eye Clinic has a growing team of 27 eye care specialists in 4 clinic locations. It marked an important milestone for PRISM in building a comprehensive national eye care platform and continuing to enhance patient experiences.\nLet's move on to our biopharma services platform with our Prescription Technology Services segment. Our leading technology platform is designed to make medicine more accessible and more affordable for everyone. What differentiates McKesson is the breadth and depth of our capabilities to address the most pressing challenges of access and affordability. Our network spans approximately 1 million providers and more than 50,000 pharmacies processing approximately 23 billion transactions annually. This connectivity and scale is the foundation that enables us to streamline access to life saving therapies, reduce friction across the health care continuum and deliver measurable impact for our customers and patients.\nOur platforms combined tech-driven patient support services, automated prior authorization, co-pay and voucher programs, all designed to help patients start, stay on and afford their therapies. We complement these offerings with best-in-class third-party logistics, advanced analytics and AI-enabled solutions that optimize efficiency and unlock value for our biopharma partners.\nThis integrated approach positions McKesson as a trusted leader not only solving today's challenges, but continuing to invest in the future, expanding our solutions for specialty therapies, modernizing technology and leveraging innovation to advance health outcomes for all.\nLet me touch on our pharmaceutical distribution business in North America. This is a foundational business that continues to deliver strong growth, underpinned by operational discipline and a differentiated value proposition. The sustained momentum of the business, driven by leading scale, strong operating leverage and robust cash flow generation enables us to continue to reinvest in the business to advance all of our enterprise priorities.\nWe have made focused and significant investments in automation to support the growing complexity in the supply chain management. These investments improve operating efficiency, enhance customer experience and unlock productivity in our workforce. An example of the advanced automation technologies we have implemented is the order storage retrieval system, which has been introduced in facilities across North America.\nThe most recent application being in our U.S. National Redistribution Center serving as the core of our hub-and-spoke distribution model. This sophisticated system improves our service levels and accuracy, streamlines processes and expand our storage capacity to better serve our customers. As an example, what would have normally taken 8 physical human touches to complete a pick, pack and ship process, now only takes 2 human touches. We are committed to investing in technology and automation, which will continue to position us for long-term growth in the future.\nIn August, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business achieved a major milestone in the implementation of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. We are now actively exchanging serialized transaction data with supply chain participants in compliance with these new FDA requirements. Behind this achievement was the extraordinary collaboration across the enterprise from technology and operations to regulatory affairs and customer support. Throughout this very complex implementation, we maintained exceptional service and accuracy with almost no disruption to our customers.\nWe're proud to lead in this initiative that will enhance the safety, transparency and integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Now let me provide a brief update on our portfolio actions. Our teams continue to actively execute on multiple work streams to separate the Medical-Surgical business, positioning it to become an independent, well-capitalized operating company. As shared in Investor Day, we're targeting to exit the Medical-Surgical Solutions business through an initial public offering. Following a customary lockup period, we intend to exit our remaining interest through a spinoff or a split-off transaction or possibly a combination of both.\nWe anticipate that this separation could be completed by the second half of calendar 2027, subject, of course, to market conditions and customary regulatory approvals. In summary, McKesson delivered another strong quarter of performance. Our strategy and execution are driving outstanding results, and this momentum continues to build across the enterprise. We operate in the dynamic market and policy backdrop, and we're highly engaged in that process across the organization.\nImportantly, we're executing from a position of strength and credibility. We remain committed to collaborating closely with policymakers and stakeholders to advocate for changes that align with the values of our company and are good for health care. We're confident that our differentiated capabilities will continue to deliver value to customers and patients and be an important part of addressing health care's most pressing challenges.\nLastly, I want to thank my fellow McKesson team members for their dedication and their contribution to advancing our mission. Together, we are advancing health outcomes for all, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional financial details.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong execution and financial performance exceeding our expectations reflecting the strength of our diversified health care platform. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results.\nI'll begin with our second quarter fiscal 2026 performance, followed by an update on our fiscal 2026 outlook. As previewed at our Investor Day in September, we implemented a new reporting structure beginning in the second quarter to enhance transparency and sharpened visibility into our growth platforms. This framework highlights the differentiated capabilities within our oncology and multispecialty and biopharma services platform, verticals where McKesson is best positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth.\nThis realignment reinforces our commitment to disciplined execution, strengthens our strategic focus and accelerates long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Turning now to results for our second quarter. McKesson delivered another strong quarter, achieving record quarterly revenues of $103 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year, driven by robust performance across our portfolio of businesses.\nGrowth was led by the North American Pharmaceutical segment, reflecting increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers and by the Oncology and Multi-specialty segment, supported by expanded distribution of oncology and multi-specialty products and contributions from recent acquisitions.\nGross profit increased 9% to $3.5 billion, primarily due to strong specialty distribution and provider growth within the Oncology and Multispecialty segment. Operating expenses decreased 1% to $2 billion, reflecting divestitures in our Canadian business and disciplined cost optimization initiatives in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.\nThese reductions were partially offset by continued investment in the Oncology and Multispecialty segment, including acquisitions completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Our unrelenting focus on cost discipline and operational efficiency powered by a technology-first mindset and AI-driven modernization continues to create value for all stakeholders. This progress is evident again in the second quarter.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of gross profit declined 570 basis points, delivering significant operating leverage as we accelerate and modernize our operations. Operating profit reached a quarterly record of $1.6 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all operating segments. This strong performance was driven by increased specialty distribution volumes in both the oncology and multi-specialty and North America Pharmaceutical segments, increased demand for access solutions in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment and continued benefits from cost optimization initiatives in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.\nThe acquisitions of PRISM and [ Core Ventures ] in the Oncology and Multispecialty segment contributed approximately 6% to year-over-year growth. Additionally, the sale of an equity investment and market decisions within the U.S. Oncology Network contributed approximately 4%. Excluding these 2 items, organic growth was approximately 16% in the quarter underscoring the strength and momentum of our core business. Interest expense declined 6% to $68 million, resulting from effective cash and portfolio management, including our derivative portfolio.\nThe effective tax rate was 17.5% compared to 21% in the prior year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we recognized net discrete tax benefits of $96 million, primarily related to the release of a valuation allowance compared to net [indiscernible] tax benefits of $44 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $124.4 million, a decrease of 4%.\nThe Second quarter earnings per diluted share increased 39% to $9.86 driven by several key factors: robust core operational performance, contributions from the first quarter acquisitions of PRISM and Core Ventures in our Oncology and Multispecialty segment, approximately $0.30 or 4% from net gains related to the sale of an equity investment and market decisions within the U.S.\nOncology Network in our Oncology and Multispecialty segment and a lower effective tax rate. Turning to second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 12 and starting with North American Pharmaceuticals. Revenues were $86.5 billion, an increase of 8%. This growth reflects a continuation of solid pharmaceutical utilization, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and specialty products.\nOur ongoing focus on operational excellence also delivered operating expense leverage during the quarter. Revenues from GLP-1 medications were $13.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $2.6 billion or 24% when compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, GLP-1 revenue increased 6%. The Segment operating profit increased 13% to $851 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to health systems, the impact of new product launches and continued operating expense efficiencies.\nIn the Oncology and Multi-specialty segment, revenues increased 32% to $12 billion, driven by strong provider and specialty distribution growth, including contributions from acquisitions completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The acquisitions of PRISM and Core Ventures contributed approximately 12% of the second quarter segment revenue growth. Operating profit increased 71% to $397 million driven by increased provider and specialty distribution volumes and contributions from the acquisitions of PRISM and core Ventures.\nThese acquisitions contributed approximately half of the segment operating profit growth in the quarter. Second quarter operating profit results also included nonrecurring net gains of $51 million from the sale of an equity investment and market decisions within the U.S. Oncology network. Excluding the impact from the acquisitions of PRISM and Core Ventures and nonrecurring net gains, segment organic operating profit increased 13%, highlighting the strength and momentum of the core business.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues increased 9% to $1.4 billion, driven by increased prescription volumes across our third-party logistics and technology services businesses. Operating profit rose 20% to $261 million, reflecting increased demand for access solutions, including prior authorization services for GLP-1 medications.\nTurning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. During the second quarter, we observed softer illnesses and product demand compared to the prior year, including vaccines and testing and lower volumes across ambulatory and extended care settings. Revenues were $2.9 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Higher volumes of specialty pharmaceuticals were offset by lower contributions from illness and products and testing across the ambulatory and extended care studies.\nCompared to the prior year, revenues from seasonal vaccines and testing volumes represented an approximate 4% headwind. I Operating profit increased 2% to $249 million, driven by operational efficiencies and cost optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by the headwind from lower contributions related to illness season products and testing.\nWrapping up our review with Corporate. Corporate expenses were $151 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we recorded pretax losses of $15 million or $0.09 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to gains of $3 million or $0.02 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. Excluding these impacts, corporate expenses were flat compared to the prior year.\nWe turn to cash and capital deployment for the second quarter is shown on Slide 13. We ended the quarter with $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, underscoring the strength of our strong liquidity position and capacity to deploy capital in a value-creating manner. Second quarter free cash flow was $2.2 billion, which included $196 million in capital expenditures. This robust cash flow performance reflects disciplined working capital management and continued operating execution strength.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $907 million of cash to shareholders which included $818 million of share repurchases and $89 million in dividend payments. These actions underscore our commitment to balance capital deployment and long-term shareholder value creation. Before reviewing our updated fiscal 2026 outlook, I'd like to provide 2 portfolio updates.\nAt Investor Day in September, we reaffirm McKesson's long track record of consistent financial performance driven by strategic clarity, consistency and disciplined execution. Our new segmentation reflects the portfolio evolution, leading to sharper strategic focus, enhanced transparency and increase long-term financial targets. Our strategic clarity and execution positioned the company to deliver sustained value across multiple environments and different cycles of health care, leading to sustained value creation.\nLet me start with Norway. Our fiscal 2026 outlook contemplates contributions from operations in Norway for the full fiscal year. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we discontinued recording depreciation and amortization on the assets involved in the transaction due to held-for-sale accounting treatment. This resulted in an accretive impact of $0.03 in the second quarter.\nFor the full year, we now anticipate approximately $0.13 of adjusted earnings accretion due to held-for-sale accounting in fiscal 2026, which compares to our prior guidance of $0.20.\nNext, we're committed to executing the separation of our Medical-Surgical Solutions business in a tax-free transaction, maximizing shareholder value. Since it was announced in May, we've made significant progress towards establishing the Medical Surgical business as an independent operating company. As I mentioned at Investor Day, we anticipate exiting the business by way of an initial public offering.\nFollowing a customary lockup period, McKesson intends to exit its remaining interest with spin-off, or a split-off transaction or potentially a combination of both. We currently anticipate that this separation could be completed by the second half of calendar 2027, subject to market conditions and customary regulatory approvals.\nOur fiscal 2026 outlook assumes 100% ownership of the Medical segment. Our portfolio transformation has delivered consistently outstanding financial results, growth and returns to shareholders. Now moving to our fiscal '26 outlook.\nOur strategy continues to deliver outstanding results propelled by the growth and differentiation of our oncology and multi-specialty and biopharma services platforms. These platforms are supported by a durable foundation of distribution assets and capabilities, positioning McKesson for sustained success.\nAt our Investor Day, we raised our earnings per diluted share outlook by $0.80 to a range of $38.50 to $38.55 which was a testament to the clarity of our strategy, strength of our portfolio and disciplined execution. Building on our strong second quarter performance and continued confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we're further increasing our fiscal 2026 earnings per diluted share outlook by $0.30 and to a new range of $38.35 to $38.85, which represents 16% to 18% growth over the prior year.\nThis update builds on the $0.80 increase announced at Investor Day in September. For fiscal 2026, we anticipate revenue growth of 11% to 15%, reflecting growth across all core businesses and operating profit growth of 12% to 16%, driven by continued momentum in execution.\nLet me start with a review of our segments. In the North American Pharmaceutical segment, our core pharmaceutical distribution operations continued to demonstrate a strong and diversified value proposition to customers. We anticipate revenue to increase 10% to 14%, and we're increasing our guidance for operating profit to 5% to 9% growth. The increased operating profit outlook is driven by solid utilization trends volume growth and continued strong specialty distribution expansion.\nIn the core distribution business, we also anticipate continued growth of GLP-1 medication. We anticipate this growth may vary from quarter to quarter. And as a reminder, prior year results include the impact of the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025. In the Oncology and Multispecialty segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 27% to 31% and operating profit growth of 49% to 53%.\nThe guidance includes the acquisitions of PRISM Vision and Core Ventures completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We're pleased with the performance of these acquisitions. We anticipate that they'll contribute approximately 30% to 34% to the fiscal 2026 operating profit growth in the segment. Our full year outlook reflects the impact of these acquisitions and strong organic specialty distribution volume growth.\nOur oncology multispecialty platform continued to deliver across distribution, practice management, data and analytics and clinical research. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we intubate revenues increased by 9% to 13%, and we are increasing the operating profit outlook to 13% to 17% growth.\nThe improved operating profit outlook reflects strong organic volume growth and momentum across our access and affordability solutions, particularly higher contribution from prior authorization services, including those related to GLP-1 medication.\nAs I previously discussed, the revenue and operating profit trajectory in this segment is not linear. It may vary from quarter to quarter, driven by several factors, including utilization trends, the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches, the evolution of a product program support requirements as it matures, which could result in a shift to other services or a program termination, product delays and supply shortages payer requirements, including utilization management and formulary strategies, annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter and the size and timing of investment to support and expand our product portfolio.\nMoving to the Medical Surgical Solutions segment. Due to lower-than-anticipated illness season product volumes compared to the prior year, including vaccines and testing, and lower volumes across ambulatory and extended care settings, we anticipate revenue and operating profit at the low end of 2% to 6% growth illnesses and variability remains a key factor and the timing and severity level of [indiscernible] can drive variability from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate corporate expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million which incorporates the impact of $4 million of pretax gains related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the first half of the fiscal year.\nTurning now to items below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $210 million to $240 million. Reduced interest expense target compared to the range provided at Investor Day reflects continued strong debt portfolio management and commitment to maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings.\nWe anticipate income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $215 million to $235 million, which includes the impact from fiscal 2026 acquisitions. And we anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of 18% to 19%. We also anticipate that the quarterly tax rate will be higher in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter due to the timing of discrete tax items.\nWe anticipate the third quarter tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%.\nWrapping up our outlook with cash flow and capital deployment. One of McKesson's enduring strengths is our proven ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow and execute value-creating capital allocation. For fiscal 2026, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. Our outlook includes plans to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of shares with estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 124 million. Our strong operating performance, combined with disciplined working capital management continues to provide ample liquidity and financial flexibility.\nWe've also strengthened our financial position by reducing leverage and optimizing our debt portfolio over time. Our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation remains a cornerstone of our strategy and a key driver of long-term shareholder value creation. In summary, McKesson delivered strong second quarter results, including record quarterly consolidated revenue and double-digit operating profit growth across 3 segments. Our updated earnings per diluted share range of $38.35 to $38.85 reflects both our second quarter results and our confidence in the business for the remainder of fiscal 2026.\nAs we continue to execute against our strategic and financial framework. The ongoing evolution of our portfolio is in line with the increased long-term targets that we committed to, and this transformation continues to translate in stronger earnings higher returns on invested capital and a fortress balance sheet positioning McKesson for discipline and strategic capital deployment. And with that, let's move to the Q&A session."

Please go ahead.\n\nJeni Dominguez\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Call.\nToday, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer.

Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeni. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate everyone joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported strong fiscal first quarter results, exemplifying the value of our differentiated solutions and our ability to continuously drive progress against our strategic priorities.\nWe delivered record consolidated revenues of $97.8 billion, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion. Three of our segments delivered double-digit growth in adjusted operating profit, reflecting continued momentum across the enterprise. We are executing against our growth commitments we outlined to our shareholders as demonstrated by these first quarter results.\nThe performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year gave us confidence to raise the full year guidance to $37.10 to $37.90 from a previous range of $36.90 to $37.70. Our financial strength reflects our commitment to deliver services with the highest standard of quality, to foster innovation and to collaborate with our customers and partners to ultimately drive forward our mission as a diversified health care services company.\nI want to focus my remarks today on our strategy and our company priorities. I want to provide you with insights into how we're driving performance in the near term and positioning McKesson for continued long-term growth. I'll then hand it over to Britt for a more detailed discussion on the first quarter financial results.\nI want to start, as I always do, with our focus on people and culture. Everything we achieve is made possible by the dedication and the commitment of our 45,000 employees. The initiatives they work on, the problems they solve are complicated, including onboarding large strategic customers and/or integrating new businesses. Success in these endeavors relies upon strong collaboration and a cohesive teamwork across our organization.\nI'm continually proud to see how our teams consistently come together to achieve our goals and deliver results. We're committed to taking care of our employees, empowering their growth and supporting their well-being. In July, we witnessed the devastating floods at truck Central Texas, resulting in widespread destruction and tragic loss of life. Our hearts go out to the families and the communities impacted in difficult moments like these, we stand ready to support each other through initiatives like McKesson Foundations taking care of our own.\nIn the past fiscal year, we delivered over 700 grants to employees going through various types of hardships. Together as a team, we're stronger and more resilient to navigate challenges that come our way. Our people, along with our partners, community and our planet are the 4 pillars we focus on.\nRecently, we published our impact report for fiscal year '25 that highlights the breadth of our impact and reaffirms our commitment to driving meaningful change across the health care landscape. I am quite proud of the progress we've made, and we're committed to leveraging our company's strengths and areas of expertise to build a healthier world for everyone. You can find our report on our corporate website.\nNow let me move on to our 2 strategic growth pillars: oncology and biopharma services. McKesson is uniquely positioned to bring innovative solutions and services to partners and patients in these areas. We began our journey in oncology over 18 years ago with the acquisition of Oncology Therapeutic Networks focusing on specialty distribution in the community-based settings. Over the years, we have significantly evolved our portfolio and extended our capabilities to other differentiated and value-added services that span across the patient's journey, including practice management, clinical trial services and data and insights.\nIn June, we were pleased to complete the acquisition of a controlling interest in Core Ventures, which is a business and administrative services organization established by Florida Cancer Specialist and Research Institute -- with the close of the acquisition, we welcome Florida Cancer Specialists and its providers to the U.S. Oncology Network. This marks an important step forward in our efforts to expand access to exceptional cancer care and local communities growing the footprint of the U.S. oncology network to approximately 3,300 providers across 700 sites in 30 states.\nThe growth of the U.S. Oncology Network combined with our strategic investments has created a flywheel effect across the oncology platform. It broadens our footprint, including distribution volume and demand for our GPO services enhances patient care access within the community with providers practicing on the same electronic health record system, it enables us to generate valuable data and insights.\nFor Florida Cancer Specialists and core Ventures integration efforts are well underway, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead to accelerate growth across our oncology platform. Leveraging our leadership in community practice and specialty solutions, we have expanded our value proposition beyond oncology and into other therapeutic areas. In April, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Prism vision, enabling us to develop a leading retina and ophthalmology platform and further enhance our practice management solutions.\nLet me move now to biopharma services and our platform there. In the first quarter, Prescription Technology Solutions delivered double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted operating profit. We continue to lead in transforming medication access and affordability. We have built a robust scaled network that digitally and securely connects providers, pharmacists and insurers so they can work together to remove barriers and improve efficiency.\nWe connected -- we're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 985,000 providers. The extensive connectivity and reach of our networks are differentiating and enable us to provide commercialization solutions at scale while bringing unique value to each of our stakeholders.\nIn the past quarter, we continued to experience volume growth and prior authorization requests. Our Prescription Technology Solutions team brings over 15 years of experience transforming the prior authorization process, making it more efficient, more transparent and more patient-focused to help ensure people get the care they need faster. Through our innovative solutions, we're committed to improving health outcomes and making a meaningful difference for our customers and their patients.\nLet's move on to our pharmaceutical distribution business in North America, these are our core foundational distribution assets in U.S. and Canada. In the first quarter, we saw growth in underlying businesses supported by solid utilization trends, accelerated growth in categories of specialty pharmaceuticals and continued focus on operational excellence.\nOur Pharmaceutical business services a wide range of customers One of the channels that we have supported and partnered with for years are community pharmacies. This past July, we hosted our annual IdeaShare conference a nationwide event that brought together community pharmacies to drive deeper connections and engagement -- despite the complexities present in the industry, their presence in the communities they serve is more important than ever. We are committed to helping them navigate this dynamic environment as a partner providing best-in-class services, empowering them through innovation, advocacy and tailored solutions for their unique business needs.\nWe're pleased to see that our Health Mart franchise, a nationwide network of independent pharmacies ranked highest among brick-and-mortar chain drugstore pharmacies in a J.D. Power 2025 U.S. pharmacy study. To support the success of our customers, and the growth of our pharmaceutical business, we continue to invest in our large and scaled distribution network modernizing our facilities and positioning our operations for long-term success.\nOperating and distribution center at our scale is complex, and we're implementing automated technologies and processes in numerous areas across our facilities, including automated storage and retrieval systems and automated picking systems for order fulfillment. These technologies are leveraged across the network to enable improvements in productivity, quality and safety for our teams.\nThey also enable new processes like the upcoming DSCSA requirements to be effectively managed. We've also expanded our cold chain capabilities to support the growing demand for specialty therapies, which often require special handling such as temperature control, ensuring product integrity from the manufacturer to the patient. Our efforts have resulted in nearly double-digit growth in cold chain lines year-over-year. These investments not only strengthen our supply chain resiliency, they also position McKesson as a trusted partner to support future growth.\nIn McKesson Canada, we expanded our dedicated automation group that leads the way towards better health through the automation of medication delivery, resulting in faster and safer treatments. We're working closely with pharmacists and health care professionals to better understand their needs and bring forward solutions that leverage technology automation.\nNow I want to provide a brief update as to our portfolio actions. Last quarter, we announced our intent to separate the Medical Surgical segment into an independent company. This is a strategic decision that aligns with our enterprise focus on capital allocation and portfolio management. and it will enhance the operational focus for both companies. We firmly believe this action will unlock significant value for the medical business in McKesson. We have a strong track record of executing on large complex transactions like the spin-off of Change Healthcare and the divestiture of our European business. We're confident in our ability to execute on this strategic initiative and maximize shareholder value. We look forward to providing an update on our progress at our upcoming Investor Day event in September.\nI also want to comment on our Norway business. This week, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our retail and distribution businesses in Norway. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Norway is the only remaining operating country in Europe. The planned exit of the Norway business will mark the final phase in our strategy of fully divesting our European businesses.\nAs I reflect on the progress across our company priorities, I'm proud of the impact we've achieved as a diversified health care services company. We continue to manage the business with discipline and focus while navigating a dynamic market and policy environment. We remain engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders to evaluate the potential impacts on our business and customers. We're committed to promoting awareness fostering collaboration and advocating for changes consistent with our values and our company's mission.\nMcKesson delivered strong first quarter results, underpinned by continued momentum across the segments. I want to again thank McKesson employees for their dedication and contribution to advancing our strategies We, as a team, are confident in our ability to carry forward the momentum with strength and focus, deliver meaningful results for our shareholders and accelerate our mission to advance health care for all.\nFinally, we're excited to host our Investor Day on September 23, during which we'll provide an update on the company's strategic priorities, growth strategies and business outlook.\nAnd with that, I'm going to hand it over to Britt for some more financial details.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Before I turn to our adjusted results, I want to provide 2 updates. As Brian mentioned in his opening remarks, we are pleased to have entered into a definitive agreement to sell the retail and distribution businesses in Norway. This transaction will complete the exit of our European operations and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We will classify the assets and liabilities related to Norway as held for sale beginning with our fiscal 2026 second quarter. The held-for-sale treatment includes the impact from discontinued depreciation and amortization and our guidance assumes an approximate $0.20 adjusted earnings per diluted share impact, and this is included in our updated full year guidance, which I will speak to in a few minutes. We've assumed that this transaction does not close during fiscal 2026.\nNext, in our first quarter, we recorded a GAAP-only pretax provision for bad debts of $189 million or $140 million after tax within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. This charge represents the remaining trade accounts receivable balances due from Rite Aid prior to its second bankruptcy filing.\nThe remainder of my comments today will refer to our adjusted results, and I'll start by discussing our first quarter fiscal 2026 results, and then I'll discuss our fiscal 2026 outlook. Our first quarter results were strong led by double-digit operating profit growth in 3 of the 4 segments. This robust performance exhibited across the enterprise reflects continued momentum in the operations, execution against our strategies and disciplined capital deployment, which is underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet.\nConsolidated revenues in the quarter increased 23% to $97.8 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment due to increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers, the addition of a strategic account customer at the beginning of the second quarter in fiscal 2025, growth of GLP-1 medications, and growth in the distribution of oncology and specialty products.\nWe've also now cycled through the impact of the strategic account onboarding. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7% and results of specialty distribution and provider growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and growth in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, driven by our access and affordability solutions which was partially offset by lower contributions in our International segment as a result of the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and WelldoCA businesses at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nOperating expenses decreased 1% to $1.9 billion, driven by divestitures in our Canadian business and cost optimization initiatives in the Medical Surgical Solutions segment. which were partially offset by increased operating expenses in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment to support growth, including first quarter fiscal 2026 acquisitions.\nTesting continues to deliver efficiency and operating leverage the disciplined focus and the implementation of process innovations in advanced technology, including artificial intelligence. I'd also like to highlight how our automation investments are enhancing outcomes for customers, partners and employees while driving measurable improvement in operating leverage.\nAcross our pharmaceutical distribution network, we're strategically allocating capital to scale automation from outbound picking to inbound receiving and replenishment. We have observed distribution centers, which have achieved up to 90% automation, serving as a tangible proof point of throughput scalability and operational consistency. These advancements are driving measurable operating leverage.\nWe also recently opened our largest specialty distribution center in Alibranch, Mississippi, which is equipped with mobile autonomous robots or cobots that assist associates in the order fulfillment process. These technologies improve productivity, efficiency and order accuracy while elevating the employee experience by reducing physical strain and minimizing injury risk.\nThese investments are advancing our capabilities delivering meaningful value to stakeholders. And these are just 2 of several examples across the enterprise that helped to contribute more than 450 basis points of year-over-year improvement our consolidated operating expense to gross profit ratio.\nOur operating profit was $1.4 billion in the quarter, which was an increase of 9%. Year-over-year results benefited from growth across our operating segments, including strong oncology and multi-specialty volumes from organic growth and recent acquisitions increased demand for access solutions in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment and benefits from the cost optimization initiatives in the Medical Surgical Solutions segment.\nAs a reminder, first quarter fiscal 2025 operating profit included $110 million of gains related to McKesson Ventures equity investments compared to gains of $1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Excluding the impact of gains related to McKesson Ventures equity investments, operating profit increased 19%. Interest expense was $44 million, a decrease over the prior year resulting from effective cash and portfolio management, including our derivative portfolio.\nThe effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.4% compared to 13% in the prior year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $23 million compared to a discrete tax benefit of $125 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $125.5 million, a decrease of 4%. The first quarter earnings per diluted share increased 5% to $8.26 Year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational performance across the business, partially offset by a higher tax rate and pretax gains of $110 million associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nExcluding the gains from McKesson Ventures investment, earnings per diluted share increased 14%.\nTurning to first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $90 billion, an increase of 25% and driven by increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers and growth in the distribution of oncology and specialty products, including contributions from acquisitions. Growth in the quarter included the onboarding of a new strategic customer as discussed previously.\nRevenues from GLP-1 medications were $12.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $3.3 billion or 38%. And when compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, GLP-1 revenue increased 11%. Segment operating profit increased 17% to $950 million, driven by growth in core distribution, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and growth in the distribution of oncology and specialty products.\nOperating profit growth in the quarter also included contributions from the acquisitions of Prism Vision and Core Ventures. These acquisitions advance our strategy in oncology and multi-specialty solutions. Although integration work remains, we're seeing early gains benefiting our differentiated platforms.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues increased 16% to $1.4 billion, driven by increased prescription volumes in the third-party logistics business. Operating profit increased 21% to $269 million, driven by higher demand for access solutions including prior authorization services for GLP-1 medications.\nTurning to Medical Surgical Solutions. In the first quarter, revenues were $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% driven by higher volumes of specialty pharmaceuticals. Operating profit increased 22% to $244 million, driven by operational efficiencies from cost optimization initiatives.\nNext, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, resulting from higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business partially offset by the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses completed at the end of the fiscal 2025 third quarter.\nExcluding the impact of divested businesses, revenues increased 5%. Operating profit was $99 million, a decrease of 3%, driven by the divestiture of the Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses, partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business. Excluding the impact of divested businesses, operating profit was flat.\nAnd wrapping up our segment review with corporate. Corporate expenses were $138 million in the quarter. As a reminder, during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we had pretax gains of $110 million or $0.62 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. Excluding McKesson Ventures gains in fiscal 2025 and 2026, corporate expenses were 4% lower than the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower opioid-related expense and technology costs.\nLet me turn to cash and capital deployment in the first quarter, which can be found on Slide 13. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.1 billion, which included $189 million in capital expenditures. We used $3.4 billion of cash for the acquisitions of Prism Vision and Core Ventures. During the quarter, we completed the $2 billion bond issuance with tenders of 5, 7 and 10 years. The proceeds of which were used to finance the Core Ventures acquisition.\nAdditionally, we returned $671 million of cash to shareholders, which included $581 million of share repurchases and $90 million in dividend payments.\nMoving now to our fiscal 2026 outlook. Our first quarter results represent strong execution against our strategies and growth across our operating segments. The strong start and momentum across the enterprise combined with our ongoing focus to deliver shareholder value through the management of our portfolio and alignment to our enterprise strategy gives us confidence in our outlook for fiscal 2026.\nDelaware first quarter results combined with our announcement of a definitive agreement to sell our Norway-based business underpins today's increase to our fiscal 2026 earnings per diluted share outlook to a new range of $37.10 to $37.9. For fiscal 2026, we anticipate revenue growth of 11% to 15% and operating profit growth of 9% to 13% when compared to the prior year.\nLet me start with a review of our segments. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 12% to 16%. As a result of strong first quarter performance, we now anticipate operating profits to increase at the high end of the previously provided range of 12% to 16% growth. In the core distribution business, we anticipate continued growth of GLP-1 medication. However, we anticipate this growth may vary from quarter-to-quarter.\nDuring the first quarter, we successfully completed 2 strategic acquisitions, PRISM Vision and Core Ventures. These actions are consistent with our disciplined capital deployment strategy, allocating capital against our differentiated growth platforms such as oncology and multispecialty. These acquisitions will deliver growth in a value-creating manner and position us for durable growth in fiscal 2026 and supporting our long-range targets.\nAs a reminder, on April 1, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in PRISM Vision Holdings, a premier provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. On June 2, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Community Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures or Core Ventures, an internal business and administrative services organization established by Florida Cancer Specialist and Research Institute.\nAs I discussed previously, we're pleased with the first quarter performance for these acquisitions. We continue to anticipate the acquisitions of PRISM and Core Ventures will contribute approximately 6% to 7% to the fiscal 2026 operating profit growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase by 8% to 12% and operating profit increased by 9% to 13%. The higher revenue outlook is due to increased third-party logistics volumes from greater demand for our supported products and programs. We anticipate continued contribution from prior authorization services, including those related to GLP-1 medications to drive increased demand for our access and affordability solutions contributing to the growth of the segment.\nThe outlook affirms our confidence in achieving operating profit growth in fiscal 2026, in line with the long-term growth rate target. As I previously discussed, the revenue and operating profit trajectory in this segment is not linear and can vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by several factors, which include utilization trends, the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches, the evolution of a product program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services or program termination, product delays and supply shortages, pay requirements, including utilization management and formulary strategies, the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio.\nWe have scale and breadth of capabilities and connections across multiple channels, including biopharma providers, retail pharmacies and payers. Our leading scale of digitally connected solutions is addressing market and patient challenges and access, affordability and adherence and delivering growth and value for all stakeholders.\nIn the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues and operating profit to increase 2% to 6%. We're pleased with the solid start to the year and the continued focus and delivery of cost optimization opportunities, resulting in operating efficiencies and better alignment with our customers.\nIn the International segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 2% decline to 2% growth and operating profit increased 3% to 7%. We Segment outlook reflects continued growth in the Canadian distribution business, partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nAs I mentioned earlier, on August 4, 2025, McKesson entered into a definitive agreement to sell its retail and distribution businesses in Norway. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Our fiscal 2026 outlook contemplates contributions related to operations in Norway for the full fiscal year and includes held-for-sale accounting treatment, adding approximately $0.20 of operating profit to the segment.\nIn the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $570 million to $630 million. When excluding the impact of McKesson Ventures gains in fiscal 2025 and 2026, corporate expenses are roughly flat compared to the prior year, a reflection of efficiency gains and cost discipline across the enterprise.\nTurning now to items below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $260 million to $290 million, and income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $215 million to $235 million. The updated interest expense outlook includes the $2 billion of debt issuance associated with the acquisition of Core Ventures completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nWe anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%, with the first half of the fiscal year to be in the range of 17% to 20% and the second half to be approximately 16% to 19%.\nWrapping up our outlook with cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. Our working capital metrics and free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of having the strength of the company and execution of our strategic priorities.\nOur outlook reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of shares in fiscal 2026. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $124 million to $125 million.\nIn summary, we delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, a continuation of the strong momentum across the enterprise. The strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses including the acquisitions of PRISM Vision and Core Ventures gives us confidence in our increased outlook.\nOur sustained financial performance, bolstered by the strength of our financial position and consistent operating execution are leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders.\nWith that, I should move to the Q&A session."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report and other SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining the call.\nEarlier today, McKesson reported strong third quarter results, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth in operating profits. Our team executed against our company priorities with focus and unwavering dedication. Thanks to their commitment, we are expanding our differentiated capabilities, driving operational efficiencies and creating real value for our partners and shareholders.\nYesterday, we were excited to announce the signing to acquire a controlling interest in PRISM Vision, which is a provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. This marks an important step as we continue to enhance our specialty services platform and capabilities. I'll share additional details about the transaction a little later in my comments. So let's move on to the third quarter results.\nDuring the quarter, revenue grew 18% to $95.3 billion, and adjusted operating profit grew 16%, to $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating profit grew across all segments, led by strong double-digit growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segment. In the Medical Surgical growth was lower than anticipated primarily driven by the late start of a softer illness season. The strength of the enterprise and the scale of our assets gave us the confidence to increase and narrow our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $32.40 to $33, to a new range of $32.55 to $32.95, which represents 19% to 20% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth.\nToday, I'm excited to share with you the great progress we've made in the past quarter, which is key to the financial results we delivered today and more importantly, to the long-run growth of the business. Then I'll turn it over to Britt for more details in the financial review.\nI want to start with our focus on talent and culture, which is foundational to our company's strategy and everything we do here at McKesson. We value the breadth of backgrounds, experiences and skills of our team members, and that includes our Board of Directors.\nEarlier this week, our Board of Directors elected two new members to our Board, [indiscernible] and Dr. [ Julie Gerberding ] Ms. [indiscernible] brings accounting and finance expertise from the Board from her experience as the former Chair and Chief Executive Officer of KPMG. Dr. [ Gerberding ], brings extensive executive experience in the health care industry and public policy arena. She was formerly the Chief Executive Officer -- or is currently the Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation for National Institute of Health, and formerly the Executive Vice President and Chief Patent Officer at Merck and a former Director of the CDC. Ms. [indiscernible] will serve on our Audit Committee and Finance Committee, and Dr. [indiscernible] will serve on our compliance committee and the Compensation and Talent Committee. These additions are yet another example of our best talent philosophy at work. We look forward to their leadership as we work together to continue to drive the growth of the company.\nLet's move on to our second priority at strengthening the distribution capabilities and performance in North America. Within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the utilization trends remained stable, leading to solid volume growth in the underlying business. The strong performance in the quarter is underpinned by our scaled distribution capabilities across multiple therapeutic areas and our ability to provide exceptional services to our customers.\nOne of the channels we serve as community pharmacies, which play a critical role in bringing accessible care to patients. Recently, we launched a strategic initiative to help protect critical pharmacy services and to elevate the pharmacy profession. We will provide funding support to eligible community pharmacy associations across all 50 states to help meet their advocacy goals and strengthen their voice in the community and the role of the community pharmacy industry.\nWithin the Medical-Surgical segment, we've strategically positioned this business to be focused on the alternate site markets. One of the market dynamics that impact this segment is the annual illness flew or respiratory season. Each illness season is unique, including an onset, its severity and how long it lasts. During the quarter, we observed lower-than-anticipated volumes related to the illness season, which impacted the third quarter results.\nMarket data shows that the number of flu-like illness cases was lower than the average of the last 5 non-COVID years and below the prior season. The softer illness season impacted demand of seasonal vaccines, illness, testing and foot traffic in primary care sites. This development, coupled with the general market weakness in the primary care channel that we've called out for the prior -- 2 previous quarters, pose a challenging market backdrop for the segment.\nDespite the impact of the market trends, we remain confident in our strategy in the [indiscernible] site market and the strength of the underlying business. We continue to take immediate and effective actions to better align our service model and capabilities with our customer needs and the market demand.\nIn the past quarter, we made important progress in the business rationalization initiatives that were previously announced. Thanks to the focus from our team, we're on track to complete the rationalization plan by the first half of fiscal 2026 and deliver meaningful savings as expected.\nMoving on to our two strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services platforms. Over the years, we have continually invested and expanded our oncology assets in alignment with our stated strategy. The oncology market continues to be the largest growing therapeutic category and is one reason we continue to invest in this area. We have built a portfolio of assets that include distribution of oncology drugs and value-added services that improve the cancer care journey.\nThrough the U.S. oncology network, we empower the delivery of advanced and integrated cancer care in the community setting, which is often closer to home and more cost-effective for the patient. We're pleased to see the continued expansion growing to over 2,750 providers across 640 sites of care in 31 different states. We provide resources and support to these community oncology practices to empower their growth and ultimately improve the patient experience and outcomes of cancer care.\nWe also provide clinical trial services to community-based practices through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which we often refer to as SCRI. Last year, the patient accruals through clinical trials increased 25% within SCRI and participated in the development of 33 of the 47 therapies approved by the FDA. We're excited to bring more innovative and life-changing therapies to community-based practices and their patients.\nAs we continue to advance our strategy on oncology and other specialties, we've also been evaluating opportunities in other therapeutic areas. Last year, we acquired certain assets from U.S. [ Retina ] and launched a new GPO program called [ Onmark ] Vision. We also have [ Retina OS ], a clinical workflow and inventory management technology that streamlines inventory revenue and payments management. All of these assets are building blocks for the acquisition that we announced yesterday. We're excited to sign an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in PRISM Vision. Its affiliated practices include 180 providers, 91 office locations and 7 ambulatory surgery centers.\nSimilar to our strategy on oncology, we see an exciting opportunity in retina and ophthalmology, given its attractive drug pipeline, the speed and innovation and practitioners' needs for additional supporting services. We have a great track record of building and growing the oncology platform over the past several years. We're taking a similar approach to the expansion in retina. We are strategic and thoughtful in building these platforms and creating a portfolio of assets that complement each other and reinforce each other. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory clearances. We look forward to advancing retina and ophthalmology patient care through a meaningful platform of distribution and other value-added services.\nOn to our biopharma services platform. We offer a portfolio of solutions that connect biopharma companies, providers, pharmacies and payers to improve the access affordability and adherence of medications. In the third quarter, the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered strong performance in line with our expectations. Growth accelerated in the quarter, reflecting strong demand across our product solutions.\nOne of our value-add solutions is prior authorizations, which automate the process and give patients access to their prescriptions faster. But in addition to prior authorizations, we're seeing continued growth from many other solutions. In the fiscal third quarter, we added access and affordability support for pharma brands that span across 30 indications in more than 12 therapeutic areas. We're pleased to support a diversified portfolio of brands with their unique needs and ultimately make these medications more accessible and affordable to providers and patients.\nBiopharma Services is a strategic growth pillar for us, and we continue to invest strategically to support its growth. In the past few quarters, we updated the user interface of our key customer systems, enhance the core technical infrastructures and improve the overall user experience. These updates help us support customers in a more efficient manager as we ramp up the annual verification program in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nLooking across our business segments, we've built a large and a diversified portfolio of assets. It is part of our continuous practice to assess this portfolio for strategic alignment. In December, we completed the divestiture of the Rexall and Well.ca businesses. This allows us to focus and prioritize investments in other strategic areas. As Canada's largest pharmaceutical distributor, we continue to invest and modernize our distribution network, introducing automation and technology to improve efficiency. We're also growing a set of biopharma solutions that include third-party logistics, patient care services and data insights.\nSo let me try to sum up the quarter. McKesson delivered strong quarterly results in fiscal 2025. Three of our four business segments grew adjusted operating profit at double-digit rates in the quarter. That represents over 80% of our business growing AOP in double digits and highlights the strong momentum across the enterprise. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we're taking strategic actions to enhance our differentiated portfolio to drive operational efficiencies and to modernize the enterprise. We're confident in our market positions and pleased with the momentum we're building across the business.\nLooking ahead, we're focused on delivering a strong finish to fiscal 2025 and driving sustainable long-term growth in the years ahead.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insights and comments.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results. I'll start with consolidated results, followed by a review at the segment level and conclude with an update on our full year fiscal '25 outlook.\nWe reported another strong quarter with notable momentum across the enterprise. We're pleased to report record quarterly revenue and operating profit, including year-over-year operating profit growth in each segment. These results demonstrate the remarkable breadth of McKesson's products and services, and reflect the focus and execution against our company priorities.\nConsolidated revenues increased 18% to $95.3 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment due to increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers and growth in the distribution of specialty products, including higher volumes in oncology and specialty provider settings. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7%, primarily a result of specialty distribution and provider growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. And growth in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, driven by our access and affordability solutions. Operating expenses increased 2% to $1.9 billion, driven by higher expenses to support growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\nWe're pleased with the focus on driving a lower operating cost structure, implementing efficiencies through automation and data capabilities and delivering insights to improve our operations, products and service offerings. This is reflected in the operating expense to gross profit ratio, which improved over 250 basis points as compared to the prior year.\nOperating profit was $1.5 billion, an increase of 16%. Year-over-year results benefited from growth across all segments. Interest expense was $62 million, an increase over the prior year, resulting from higher average balances of our loan portfolio during the quarter. The effective tax rate was 23.9%, compared to 10.6% in the prior year. This rate was in line with the guidance provided at recent investor industry conferences.\nThird quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $126.6 million, a decrease of 5%. In third quarter, earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $8.03. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational performance and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate resulting from discrete items in the quarter.\nTurning to third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 12 and starting with our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues were $87.1 [ billion ], an increase of 19%. Revenue growth was led by higher volumes from retail national account customers, growth from specialty product distribution, including higher volumes from oncology and specialty provider settings, and partially offset by the anticipated decline of certain brand volumes due to formulary changes by a retail national account customer beginning in our fiscal 2025 1st quarter.\nRevenues from GLP-1 medications were $10.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $3.4 billion or 45% when compared to the prior year. We anticipate continued GLP-1 medication growth year-over-year, however, with variability from quarter-to-quarter. Operating profit increased 14% to $944 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to health systems and specialty providers, the onboarding of a new strategic customer and growth in our differentiated oncology platform, partially offset by expected lower distribution volumes of COVID-19 vaccines as compared to the prior year.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, organic and new program growth, across our access and affordability solutions led to strong growth compared to the prior year. Revenues increased 14% to $1.4 billion, and operating profit increased 22% to $235 million, Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions, including prior authorization services for GLP-1 medications and growth in our third-party logistics business. Year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions.\nTurning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. As Brian mentioned earlier in his remarks, we observed lower-than-anticipated volumes due to less demand for illness season products. As we've previously discussed, each illness season is unique and the timing and severity level of each illness season could drive variability from quarter to quarter. Through the fiscal third quarter, this illness season had lower severity levels compared to prior years and lower than our expectations, impacting foot traffic in the primary care setting that we serve.\nAs measured by IQVIA data, illness severity was approximately 62% of the average of the previous 5 non-COVID illness seasons. In the third quarter, revenues decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. The decline in revenues can be attributable to the lower levels of seasonal vaccines, illness testing and related medical surgical supplies in the primary care channel. Operating profit increased 4% to $294 million, driven by operational efficiencies from the cost optimization initiative that we announced in Q1, and growth in the Extended Care business. These were partially offset by lower contributions in the primary care channel as compared to the prior year.\nAs we previously guided, we anticipate the cost optimization initiatives will deliver $100 million of cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2025, with a higher proportion coming in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the execution to date and we remain confident in achieving these savings.\nNext, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.9 billion, an increase of 6%, and operating profit was $124 million, an increase of 18%, driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business. Operating profit included $19 million or $0.11 of earnings accretion, resulting from the held-for-sale accounting related to the sale of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses, which was completed on December 30, 2024.\nWrapping up our segment review with corporate. Corporate expenses were $134 million, which included a pretax gain of $6 million, or $0.04 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. compared to pretax losses of $8 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nLet me turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 13. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $2.6 billion. Timing, including the day of the week that the quarter ended on led to approximately $2 billion of cash shifting from our fiscal third quarter to our fiscal fourth quarter. This does not impact our full year free cash flow guidance.\nAdditionally, free cash flow included $196 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. In the third quarter, we returned $919 million of cash to shareholders, which included $827 million of share repurchases at an average price of $537 per share. And we made $92 million in dividend payments.\nNow let me discuss our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. As a result of our third quarter performance, and the confidence that we have in the outlook for the remainder of the year, we're raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $32.55 to $32.95. Our strategy continues to yield exceptional results led by the growing and differentiated oncology and biopharma services platform, supported by a foundation centered on a strong core of distribution assets.\nIn the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, our core pharmaceutical distribution operations continued to demonstrate a diversified and strong value proposition to customers. We anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 20%, and operating profit to increase 11% to 13%. This updated segment outlook incorporates strong third quarter performance as well as continued momentum in the core distribution business, including stable utilization trends, performance of our sourcing program and continued growth in specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to be pleased with the strategic partner we announced and onboarded in July. This partnership is a testament to our leading distribution and sourcing capabilities and our strong customer value proposition. We anticipate the strategic partnership will contribute approximately $32 billion of incremental revenue in full year fiscal 2025, and it's incorporated in the full year outlook.\nOur oncology platform is delivering across a range of capabilities, including distribution, practice management, data and analytics and clinical research. More than 2,750 providers in the U.S. Oncology Network continue to experience solid growth with same site visits increasing 6% in the quarter. And yesterday, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire controlling interest in PRISM Vision Holdings, a premier provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. This transaction advances McKesson's specialty position and our commitment to improve and expand patient access to quality community care. We intend to develop a leading platform for retinal care, delivering differentiated solutions and value across providers, biothermal partners and patients. McKesson's long track record of leading practice management and clinical research outcomes, with our differentiated oncology platform, will allow us to expand our suite of solutions and continue to pursue our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all.\nMcKesson will purchase an 80% ownership interest for approximately $850 million. We anticipate financing the transaction with a mixture of cash and debt. Following completion of the transaction, PRISM Vision will be part of McKesson's broad set of specialty solutions. The financial results we consolidated with McKesson's U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\n[indiscernible] closing, PRISM is anticipated to be approximately $0.20 to $0.30 accretive to McKesson's adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first 12 months post closing. And $0.65 to $0.70 -- $0.65 to $0.75 accretive by the end of the third year following the close of the transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory clearances, and we've not included any financial results from this transaction in our updated fiscal 2025 outlook.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues increased 9% to 12%, and operating profit to increase 12% to 15%. The updated outlook incorporates the strong third quarter performance and affirms our confidence in achieving operating profit growth at or above the long-term growth rate targets in fiscal 2025.\nAs we've previously communicated, we anticipate revenue and operating profit growth will not be linear and will vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by several factors, including the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches, utilization trends, the evolution of a product program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services, or a program termination, product delays and supply shortages, payer requirements, including utilization management and formulary strategies, the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter, and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio.\nMoving to Medical-Surgical Solutions. During the third quarter, we observed lower-than-anticipated illness season volumes, including vaccines and testing and lower volumes in the primary care channel, which negatively impacted third quarter results more than originally anticipated. As a result of third quarter performance and our revised outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we now anticipate revenues and operating profit to be roughly flat to the prior year, a result of the weaker-than-anticipated illness season.\nDespite these macro challenges, we have made progress toward our previously announced cost optimization initiatives, which have already begun to drive anticipated operational efficiencies in this segment. We continue to anticipate these initiatives will deliver approximately $100 million in cost savings in fiscal 2025 as previously outlined, and will be more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter.\nIn the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 3% to 7%, and operating profit increased 10% to 14%. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we completed the sale of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses at the end of the third quarter. This transaction closed earlier than we had previously anticipated, negatively impacting operating profit guidance and is the main driver behind the change in guidance for the segment.\nWe also remain committed to exit and fully divest our European business. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we've not entered into an agreement to sell, and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit.\nFinally, in the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $480 million to $520 million, which incorporates the impact of $6 million of pretax gains related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the third quarter. As a reminder, McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment, quarter-to-quarter, which may result in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment.\nMoving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $255 million to $265 million, reflecting higher-than-anticipated interest expense in the third quarter and anticipated additional borrowing activities driven by the timing of working capital in the fourth quarter. We anticipate income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $185 million to $195 million, owing to the success of ClarusONE's generic sourcing operations. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 17% to 19%.\nAnd turning to cash flow and capital deployment. We remain focused on shareholder value creation and our disciplined capital deployment approach remains unchanged. It starts with stable and growing free cash flow. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Next, we'll continue to deploy capital to grow the business on strategy. The acquisition of PRISM Vision is a good example of this.\nSecondly, we'll return capital to our shareholders through a growing dividend and value-creating share repurchases. Our guidance includes plans to repurchase approximately $3.2 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $128 million. And finally, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with stable credit ratings.\nWrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance. We anticipate revenue growth of 16% to 18%, and operating profit growth of 13% to 15% compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $32.55 to $32.95, which represents approximately 19% to 20% growth as compared to fiscal 2024.\nBefore I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2026. We anticipate our operating momentum to persist. As Brian mentioned earlier, approximately 80% of the operating profit of the company is growing at double-digit growth rates in fiscal 2025. As a result, we maintain confidence in the long-term adjusted EPS target of 12% to 14% growth.\nIn U.S. Pharmaceutical, there are several positive items that we anticipate will continue to support growth in fiscal 2026. These include the scale and efficiency of our pharmaceutical distribution operations, our leading position in specialty, including the breadth of our oncology platform, the U.S. Oncology Network, GPO services, Ontada and Sarah Cannon Research Institute. The growth of other specialties in areas like retina and ophthalmology, which include the recently announced acquisition of PRISM Vision. And our leading generics offerings, including the strength of ClarusONE.\nWe anticipate that the strength we're seeing across the Prescription Technology Solutions segment will continue to benefit from our leading products and capabilities, supported by several factors, which would include stable utilization trends, differentiated access and affordability programs, unmatched connectivity as our solutions are in the workflow of over 950,000 providers and more than 50,000 pharmacies, and innovative products and services supported by ongoing investments.\nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. We're confident that the cost optimization actions we've taken will better align our business to the markets and customers that we serve. We'll continue to evaluate the environment as the illness season progresses, as primary care markets continue to stabilize, and the overall impacts from our early cost optimization efforts materialize.\nFinally, we'll continue to invest in adding capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation and regulatory excellence capabilities. We are modernizing the enterprise and we're investing in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in cloud, networking and infrastructure. We're also accelerating the use of AI to unlock the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. We're using AI to improve the customer experience and improved productivity, including supply chain disruption, predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms and fraud detection.\nIn closing, our third quarter results represent another strong performance with operating profit growth across all segments, demonstrating remarkable execution against our strategic growth pillars. Through the durability of our business models, the scale and differentiation across our solutions and services in the investments we're making to modernize and accelerate the enterprise, we're committed to delivering value creation. We're confident in McKesson's bright future. We have leading positions across distribution and biopharma services, driven by our execution and innovative solutions.\nBefore turning to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank Rachel Rodriguez. Rachel's is taking a new role on our corporate FP&A team. I'd like to thank Rachel for her positive impact leading Investor Relations for the past 3.5 years, and the partnership with both Brian and me. And I'd like to welcome [ Jenny Dominguez ], who will now be leading the Investor Relations team. Jenny has a long track record in several leadership positions across our finance teams at McKesson.\nAnd with that, let's move to the Q&A session."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move into a question-and-answer session. Today's discussions will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report and other SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and I'll extend my good afternoon to everyone as well. Thank you for joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported first quarter company revenues of $79.3 billion, reflecting 6% growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 8% to $7.88, above our original expectations. As a result of our performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per diluted share from $31.25 to $32.05 to a new range of $31.75 to $32.55.\nThe continued business growth and strong cash flow generation allowed us to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. We're also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend and additional share repurchase authorization up to $4 billion. This brings the total share repurchase authorization to approximately $10 billion as of July of 2024. Underpinning the financial performance is our continued execution on our company priorities. It was nearly 5 years ago when we centered our strategy around 4 company priorities that embarked on the journey of transforming into a diversified health care services company.\nWe've been consistently executing against these strategies, driving enhanced value to our customers and delivering sustained financial growth across our operating segments. Of course, transformation and execution is a lot of hard work takes the efforts of the full team, and the path to sustainable growth is not always perfectly linear. During the first quarter, we saw solid operating performance led by our Pharmaceutical Distribution business in the U.S. and Canada. Meanwhile, we experienced some headwinds in other parts of the business.\nIn Medical-Surgical, growth in the primary care channels was really slower than we anticipated, resulting in a year-over-year decline for the first quarter. In Prescription Technology Solutions, adjusted operating profit was unchanged from the prior year, driven by growth in affordability solutions, offset by lower contributions due to the mix of the services within our access programs and higher expenses to support future growth. We remain committed to our long-term growth targets.\nWe have strong conviction in our strategy and confidence in the strength of our differentiated capabilities across the enterprise. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2025, our focus remains on our company priorities and advancing our role as a diversified health care services company. We are investing in the business, especially where we can leverage technology to enhance product offerings and improve operational efficiencies. We've made great strides in these areas, and I'll plan to share a few examples before I hand it over to Britt.\nLet me start though with our focus on people and culture. We firmly believe that people are the foundation for everything we do here at McKesson as we strive to become the best place to work in health care. Recently, we were named one of America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes, recognizing our dedicated efforts to fostering inclusion caring and belonging in the workplace. We also take a very thoughtful and strategic approach to attracting and retaining talent across the company, and this, of course, includes our Board of Directors.\nIn June, our Board of Directors welcomed Deborah -- Dr. Deborah Dunsire as a new Independent Director serving on the Compensation and Talent Committee as well as the Finance Committee. She brings decades of experience in biopharmaceuticals and in oncology specifically. She is a highly respected health care industry leader as the former CEO of multiple biopharmaceutical companies. We are grateful for the unique experience that Dr. Dunsire brings to our Board as she joins us on this exciting journey of growth and innovation.\nMoving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth in our distribution business. During the first quarter, we saw solid growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Adjusted operating profit grew 6%, driven by growth in Specialty Pharmaceuticals and strong results in our Oncology platform, which includes U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada, Provider Solutions and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which we often referred to as SCRI.\nThe results demonstrated the diversity and breadth of our oncology assets. Also in the Pharmaceutical segment, one of the achievements I really want to highlight is the successful onboarding of a large distribution customer this past July. This is a significant endeavor that requires close coordination across much many, many parts of the organization. I'm deeply grateful for the dedication and the commitment of the teams at McKesson. They worked hard to ensure an efficient and smooth transition for our customer and most importantly, for their patients. This is an example of the terrific execution McKesson is known for.\nMoving on to the International segment. We saw growth in the quarter above expectations, primarily driven by the performance of our Canadian business, which includes pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies and technology-enabled capabilities. We're pleased to see organic growth in the business supported by the stable trends in pharmaceutical volumes. Throughout the quarter, the team also identified opportunities to apply technology and artificial intelligence in areas like inventory control and supply chain management. We're still at the early stages of application, but the opportunities ahead of us are exciting.\nLet's turn to the Medical-Surgical segment. Market environment over the last several years, which obviously included the COVID-19 era, has been pretty dynamic and introduced volatility. But generally, it was very favorable for our medical business. As market conditions continue to normalize, we've seen some general market weakness in the primary care channel, which impacted our first quarter. We're taking actions to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts.\nThese efforts will enhance our core distribution capabilities while continuing to invest in efficiencies to better serve our customers, partners and patients. Despite a weaker-than-expected start to the year, we remain confident in our assets and unique positions in the alternate site markets and our ability to drive long-term growth.\nMoving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. We are steadily executing our strategy to grow our oncology platform and improve patients' cancer care experiences. Building upon the foundational distribution services, we have built extensive capabilities spanning a patient's journey in cancer treatment. We're driving strong momentum across the oncology platform, demonstrating our differentiated value propositions and unique positions in this space.\nDuring the first quarter, we aligned all the oncology-related assets and teams, including the U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada, Provider Solutions and SCRI into one organization to further align our oncology platform. We view this as a natural step as we accelerate our go-to-market strategies across our oncology capabilities. It will also allow us to better execute on our oncology strategy and deliver a connected and seamless customer experience across this diversified portfolio.\nOne of the foundational assets in the oncology platform is the U.S. Oncology Network. In the past year, the network saw significant growth as reflected in the addition of new practices, the growth in physician numbers and steady increases in patient visits as both patients and providers continue to recognize the value of the network. In the last fiscal year, we welcomed 4 practices to the U.S. Oncology Network, expanding our geographic footprint and increasing access to lower-cost oncology care, and we're pleased to see the momentum continuing.\nWe announced earlier today, we welcome the Tennessee Cancer Specialist to the network, bringing the total number of providers in the network to now exceed 2,600. In addition to practice management, we also support the community practices through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, a fully integrated oncology research organization aimed at expanding clinical research and increasing access to clinical trials. SCRI's research network brings together more than 1,300 physicians who are actively enrolling patients into clinical trials at more than 250 locations in 24 states across the United States.\nIn the past year, practices in the U.S. Oncology Network participated in over 200 clinical trials through SCRI. And earlier this year, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca that will introduce modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery time lines, reduce site burdens and enhance patient enrollment.\nLet's move now to biopharma services, our second strategic growth pillar, which focuses on improving medication access, affordability and adherence through a scaled and connected network. During the quarter, adjusted operating profit in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment was unchanged year-over-year. Growth in our Technology Services products, particularly within the affordability solutions, was offset by lower contributions due to the mix of services within our access programs and higher expenses to support future growth.\nLeveraging our differentiated physician pharmacy and patient networks and our transaction scale, we believe we are strategically well positioned to continue to deliver value to biopharma. In the first quarter, our affordability programs have saved patients nearly $2.2 billion in out-of-pocket costs. In addition, we continue to offer a variety of services and capabilities that help patients get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. Many of our products achieved this by integrating automation and technology into the existing processes.\nWe support more than 650 biopharma brands and have a strong footprint in key therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and cardiology. Our provider network is able to reach more than 50% of the specialists in each of these growing therapeutic areas. To improve the efficiency of our solutions and enhance customer experience as we continue to explore more use cases for technology and AI. One of the more recent examples include the implementation of a chatbot, which leverages AI to answer common user questions about the prior authorization status.\nWe're also leveraging AI to improve internal forecasting of customer demand, allowing us to better plan for operations and staffing needs. We really think that pairing AI with humans further differentiates our capabilities and will best position our business for the future. Now let's pull everything together. We're pleased with the continued progress in advancing our company priorities. Despite the somewhat mixed segment results in the quarter, we are confident that we have a clear and robust plan to deliver on our financial commitments.\nWe have a strong business foundation and a well-defined strategy and a track record of execution with dedication and excellence. Our differentiated offerings will continue to drive better health outcomes for our customers and their patients. With that, I'll hand it over to Britt.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, McKesson had another solid quarter with earnings per share results that exceeded our expectations, resulting in an increase to our full year guidance. These results reflect the continued growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading oncology and specialty capabilities and our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution operations within the International segment.\nI'm also pleased that our Board of Directors approved two actions in July: first, a 15% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.71 per share, marking the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases; and second, an additional $4 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total share repurchase authorization to approximately $10 billion as of July of 2024. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board and management have in the execution of our strategic priorities as we continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our shareholders.\nMy comments today refer to our adjusted results unless I state otherwise. I'll start with the consolidated results, followed by a review at the segment level and conclude with an update on our outlook. Consolidated revenues were $79.3 billion, an increase of 6%, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications.\nGross profit was $3.1 billion, an increase of 4%, primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our Provider Solutions business and higher distribution volumes in our Canadian business included in the International segment. These were partially offset by lower contributions from the primary care channel in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.\nOperating expenses increased 7% to $1.9 billion, principally to support growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Year-over-year results were also impacted by increased technology investment across the enterprise and the lapping of prior year integration costs result -- related to the SCRI joint venture and [indiscernible] savings solutions. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by $110 million of pretax gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments included in corporate expenses compared to pretax losses of $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nYear-over-year results benefited from continued growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower volumes across the primary care channel in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. Interest expense was $70 million, an increase over the prior year, resulting from higher average balances of our loan portfolio throughout the quarter and a prior year gain on debt extinguishment of $9 million.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, driven by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits of $125 million in the quarter. As a reminder, we had a net discrete tax benefit of $147 million in the first quarter of the prior year. As we've discussed previously, we provide annual effective tax rate guidance as the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict.\nFirst quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 130.7 million, a decrease of 4%. Wrapping up our consolidated results, earnings per diluted share increased 8% to $7.88, ahead of our expectations, driven by pretax gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, a lower share count and operating profit growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\nTurning to first quarter segment results. It can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered solid revenue and operating profit growth. Once again, first quarter results demonstrate the continued momentum across all customer segments and our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth. Revenues were $71.7 billion, an increase of 7%. Revenue growth reflects positive utilization trends, leading to increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications.\nIn the quarter, revenues for GLP-1 medications were $8.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.8 billion or 26% when compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenues for GLP-1 medications increased $1.3 billion or 17% as supply constraints moderated in the quarter. We anticipate continued GLP-1 medication growth year-over-year, however, with variability from quarter-to-quarter. For the quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $815 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems.\nWithin the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, our comprehensive platform of leading oncology assets continues to grow and deliver value for customers and patients. Our ongoing investments in the oncology platform further differentiate our capabilities. More than 2,600 providers in the U.S. Oncology Network continued to experience solid growth with same site visits increasing 6% in the quarter. U.S. Oncology Network has further strengthened by a set of broad capabilities, including provider solutions, GPO services, data and insight through Ontada and clinical trial capabilities through our Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which includes clinical trial matching, an accelerated clinical trial setup.\nWe remain excited about our leading and differentiated oncology offerings and intend ongoing investment to sustain the growth and progress we're seeing against our strategic priorities.\nMoving to Prescription Technology Solutions. Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered revenues of $1.2 billion and operating profit of $223 million, both flat to the prior year. First quarter results reflect growth across our technology services products, including increased demand for our affordability solutions, including growth in e-voucher and e-prescribe. Revenue included 18% sequential growth in third-party logistics. However, these results were lower than anticipated due to drug product launch delays, which had an approximately 7% impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter.\nOperating profit was impacted by lower contributions from our access solutions due to the mix of transactions and services we provide across our access program and higher expenses to support future growth across the business. We remain confident that the segment operating profit will grow at or above the long-term growth target rate on an annual basis.\nTurning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. First quarter results in this segment were below our expectations. Revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1%, and operating profit was $200 million, a decrease of 15%. These results were driven by higher volumes of specialty pharmaceuticals, offset by lower volumes across the primary care channel, including customer mix and product demand shifts, and the lapping of prior year nutritional product strength in the extended care channel.\nNext, let me address our International results. Revenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of 6%, and operating profit was $102 million, an increase of 13%, driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $35 million in the quarter, which included pretax gains of $110 million or $0.62 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to pretax losses of $7 million or $0.04 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nAs we've previously discussed, McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter, which may result in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude, which can vary for each investment. Let me turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.5 billion, which included $167 million in capital expenditures.\nIn the quarter, free cash flow was impacted by the timing of tax payments and working capital investments to support the onboarding of new customers in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. We returned $609 million of cash to shareholders, which included $527 million of share repurchases and $82 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and, therefore, can vary from quarter-to-quarter.\nNow let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. We continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, leveraging our broad capabilities across the enterprise. As a result of our first quarter performance and confidence in the outlook over the balance of the year, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $31.75 to $32.55. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2025, we remain confident in our differentiated oncology and biopharma services assets and our strategy to advance McKesson as a diversified health care services company.\nLet me start with our segments. In the first quarter, we experienced strong momentum across our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our broad oncology offering. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last 5 years.\nOur fiscal 2025 outlook for the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment is a continuation of this momentum. Our outlook also contemplates the impact of the distribution contract with Optum that went into effect in July of 2024. Thanks to dedicated effort from our employees, we delivered a seamless onboarding experience in July. As we previously outlined, start-up costs associated with this contract implementation were not material to first quarter results. However, we made investments in working capital during the quarter in advance of the contract start date.\nWe are pleased to expand our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with Optum, and this is a testament to our leading distribution and sourcing capabilities, including our strong customer value proposition. We now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues will increase 13% to 16%. When compared to prior guidance, we anticipate lower contribution from branded pharmaceuticals, which includes lower volumes for HUMIRA, and we anticipate operating profit to increase 8% to 10%.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 14% to 18% and operating profit to increase 11% to 15%, a modest decline from the prior guidance. The updated outlook for the segment reflects the lower-than-anticipated first quarter results and the impact of product launch delays. During the first quarter, demand for our access solutions, including prior authorization volumes related to GLP-1 medications, demonstrated a slower rate of growth compared to the prior year, including the mix of transactions and services across our various access programs and volatility driven in part by product delays and shortages.\nThese results were lower than our expectations in the first quarter. As we've previously communicated, we remain confident in the long-term growth rate targets on an annual basis. However, we anticipate the growth trajectory in this segment will vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by several factors that include utilization trends; the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches; the evolution of a products program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services or a program termination; product delays and supply shortages; the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter; and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio.\nWe see solid market demand for our differentiated suite of solutions and services that help improve patients' access, affordability and adherence to medication as well as help to support biopharma manufacturers throughout the life cycle of their products. We continue to build differentiated technology-enabled solutions that can seamlessly be used in the workflow of payers, providers and pharmacies. We remain confident that our market-leading assets, depth of services and capabilities and continued investment in innovation position us for growth in line or modestly above our long-range targets.\nMoving to Medical-Surgical Solutions. We anticipate revenues to increase 3% to 7% and operating profit to be at the low end of the initial guidance range of 6% to 8%. Over the last few years, including the period covering COVID, the Medical-Surgical environment has been dynamic and experienced volatility across the customers and products within the primary care channel and sites of care.\nMcKesson's unparalleled breadth of services and capabilities led to strong performance. As market conditions have normalized, we've noted instances of general market weakness in the primary care channel. This led to lower sales and operating profit contributions in the first quarter. Our updated full year outlook reflects the results from the first quarter and the trends we are seeing in the market. And we anticipate that these trends will continue through the second quarter.\nAs Brian noted in his remarks, in response to the market conditions today, we are announcing a series of initiatives within the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts. In addition to delivering improved operating performance, these actions will result in great alignment across the organization while continuing to invest to better serve our customers, partners and patients.\nWe estimate total charges between $100 million and $150 million, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee-related costs, facility and other exit-related costs as well as long-lived asset impairments. This restructuring program is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of fiscal 2026. These initiatives will lead to improved margins, a streamlined infrastructure and operating leverage. We anticipate the benefits from this program will begin in the second half of this fiscal year.\nWe are well positioned with leading assets and capabilities across all the alternate sites of care, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering long-term growth. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit increase 8% to 12%. We are pleased with the first quarter performance in our Canadian business and anticipate continued growth in fiscal 2025. We also remain committed to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit.\nAs a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not yet entered into an agreement to sell. Contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $495 million to $555 million, which incorporates the impact of $110 million of pretax gains related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the first quarter as well as increased technology spend.\nWe're pleased with the development and contributions from our enterprise technology organization, including the pace of our technology investments, focused on supporting growth, innovation and efficiency. Our investments in AI will continue to focus on improving the customer experience. We continue to evaluate the enterprise technology operating model approach to effectively support the development of our strategy and needs of the organization, our customers and partners. We anticipate an increased level of investment in the technology operating model to accelerate the organization and improve business continuity, compliance and operating efficiency.\nWrapping up our outlook. We anticipate interest expense to be approximately $245 million to $265 million, reflecting the impact from increased average balances on the company's loan portfolio and higher interest rates throughout the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2025. We anticipate income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million, reflecting the success of ClarusONE's generic sourcing operations. And we anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 17% to 19%, reflecting the positive discrete tax items recognized in the first quarter.\nAs a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of the quarter.\nOur guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 128 million to 130 million. We will continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, creating value for our shareholders. This discipline has led to a return on invested capital approaching 28%.\nWrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance. We anticipate revenue growth of 13% to 15% and operating profit growth of 10% to 15% as compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $31.75 to $32.55, which represents growth of 16% to 19% as compared to fiscal 2024. Our guidance assumes that the first half of the fiscal year will deliver less contribution than previously anticipated, with the second half delivering approximately 53% of the full year earnings.\nIn closing, our fiscal 2025 outlook incorporates continued momentum across the business. We remain confident in our leading positions in growth pillars across oncology and biopharma services platforms. We are confident the actions we are taking now will sustain the growth we have delivered over the past several years. We have a strong and stable financial foundation, which positions us to execute on our capital allocation strategy. We remain positioned to deliver for our customers and our partners and to create sustainable shareholder value. With that, we can move to the Q&A."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. .\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Today, we reported our fiscal fourth quarter results marking the close to a strong fiscal 2024. We want to thank the 51,000 McKesson employees for their terrific efforts over the course of this year as together, we drove the business and achieved significant progress in advancing our mission and our strategies. .\nIn fiscal 2024, consolidated revenue grew 12% to $309 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased by 6% to $27.44, both exceeding the expectations we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. We're pleased with the growth across the enterprise, supported by our differentiated portfolio of assets, our innovative solutions and our deep commitment to quality and operational excellence. We're particularly excited about the opportunities within our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services.\nDuring the year, we saw a record expansion in the U.S. oncology network and strong market demand for our access, affordability and adherence solutions. I'm going to start my remarks today with a review of our company priorities and then I'm going to hand it over to Britt, who will take us through more details on the financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2025.\nWhat you will take away from both of us today is our confidence in the strength of the underlying businesses, our commitment to continue carrying out the strategy and the momentum into the next year. The first company priority I want to touch on is our focus on people and culture. Over the past few years, we've made continued progress in transforming McKesson into a diversified health care services company. That requires us to embrace new ideas and lead at the forefront of innovation. We're honored to be recognized as one of America's most innovative companies by Fortune.\nWe'll continue to strengthen our innovative culture, which is essential to our growth strategy overall. Recently, we were also named as one of America's greatest workplaces for women by Newsweek and a top women employer by Diversity Com Media, I am pleased to see our company-wide efforts continue to be recognized externally. I'm also really quite impressed by the commitment and leadership exhibited by so many McKesson employees and the initiatives they take on to support each other and to create an open and collaborative culture.\nMoving on to our 2 strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These are both pivotal assets that unlock tremendous value and bring significant benefits to our customers and stakeholders. Over the years, we've been building out our portfolio of assets around oncology, spanning from the distribution of related therapies to practice management, to oncology data insights and other value-added services. We're very pleased with the meaningful expansion in our oncology assets as reflected in the growth of the U.S. oncology network.\nWe welcome 4 practices to the network in the fiscal year, including regional cancer care associates, Cancer Center of Kansas, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners. The addition of these new practices expands our geographic footprint and allows us to provide our services to a broader set of providers and importantly, to the patients they serve. As of April, the network has grown to approximately 2,600 providers at 600 sites of care across 31 states. We grew the provider network through a combination of newly affiliated practices and the recruitment of new providers to existing practices.\nWe saw organic growth in providers at more than 75% of the practices. But this extensive reach within the community oncology setting, the U.S. oncology network now treats over 1.4 million patients each year. In addition to practice management, we also provide clinical trial services to these community-based practices. In 2022, we expanded our clinical trial capabilities through the formation of a joint venture that now operates under the name of Sarah Cannon Research Institute or sometimes referred to as SCRI.\nIn the past year, practices in the U.S. oncology network participated in over 200 clinical trials through SCRI, enrolling more than 3,100 patients in treatment studies across various disease states. And in February, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca to enhance the delivery of oncology clinical trials. Working together, the 2 parties will implement modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery time lines, reduced site burden and enhance trial enrollment within our scaled provider network.\nIn addition to oncology, our other differentiated growth priority is our biopharma services platform, our portfolio of connected solutions provides unique value propositions to biopharma companies and help them improve medication access, affordability and adherence. In fiscal 2024, we saw strong growth in the Prescription Technology segment, delivering 23% growth in adjusted operating profit. More importantly, in the past year, our differentiated solutions help patients save more than $8.8 billion on brand and specialty medications.\nWe helped to prevent approximately 10.7 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges and we help patients access their medicine more than 94 million times. The biopharma services platform was built through years of strategic investments. It includes targeted acquisitions that accelerated our growth strategy and internal investments that drove innovation and enhanced capabilities. One of the first assets we acquired was Relay Health and it's foundational to the network and services we offer today.\nFor those who aren't familiar with this business, it helps adjudicate prescription claims and enable the efficient delivery of prescription drugs. It's now connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and processes, billions of transactions annually. The connectivity to the pharmacies provides us insights into the patient's journey and it helps us develop additional solutions programs like co-pay assist programs and digital coupons. We want to provide our customers not just a claims switch solution, but a robust platform that connects key stakeholders delivers access and affordability solutions and ultimately improves the patient's experience and outcomes.\nLet's move on now to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. We have scaled and durable assets in both pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution, and we continue to deliver sustainable growth in these core businesses. In fiscal 2024, U.S. Pharmaceuticals delivered solid results to 16% increases in revenue and a 7% increase in adjusted operating profit, which I'll remind you is at the high end of our long-term target for this segment.\nTo support the business growth and the evolving needs of our customers, we continue to invest in our infrastructure, ensuring that the distribution assets are technologically equipped to maximize capacity and efficiency. And while we're still in the early stages of investing in capabilities of artificial intelligence, we've already developed tools and algorithms that apply AI in the supply chain. This is enabling us to move products more quickly and nimbly throughout our distribution centers, generating cost savings and continuing to improve our service levels.\nWe'll continue to make these targeted and strategic investments that support the sustainable growth of our business. Our core distribution business is also complemented by a growing portfolio of services and solutions around specialty and oncology which adds to our differentiated market position and supports our unique value proposition to our customers. And today, we're excited to talk about our strategic relationship with Optum. We started servicing a portion of Optum's business last year, and we're pleased to get the opportunity to expand the scope of our services starting July of 2024.\nWe believe this relationship is a strong testament to our differentiated capabilities and services across pharmaceutical distribution, sourcing and oncology. We look forward to the opportunity to serve and grow with all of our customers, including now Optum. As we assess investment opportunities and we allocate resources across the enterprise, we strive to ensure that our decisions align with our strategic priorities and with our mission of improving health care in every setting.\nWe want to become not only a diversified health care services company, but also a company that enables positive change in our communities and drive impact. In April, we launched a new initiative aimed at advancing HealthEquity for at-risk populations in underserved communities. We have a long history of working with pharmacies and providers in the community setting. Now we want to leverage our business resources and expertise to support their growth and enable better access to health care in many of these communities.\nWith this project, we look to identify and address pharmacy deserts where residents faced significant challenges in accessing essential pharmacy services. We chose Avondale, Ohio as our pilot activation site. We help facilitate an expedited path to an independent pharmacy ownership in the local community, and we opened the pharmacy this past December. I had the opportunity to be there personally and experience the joy of those who live in that community appreciating something that most of us take for granted, a pharmacy near our house.\nWe look forward to making a lasting difference in more communities like Avondale in the future. We also support and fund many charitable works through the McKesson Foundation. This past year marked an important milestone for the foundation as it celebrated its 80th anniversary. During the last year alone, it funded nearly 50 organizations through its grant-making program and dispersed approximately $9 million, 1/3 of which supported direct patient care and assistance. We're also pleased to see continued increase in employee participation in these impactful initiatives. In fiscal 2024, McKesson employees put in over 44,000 volunteer hours with charities across the U.S. and Canada. I'm truly proud of what we have achieved as a team to support the communities and to live our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all.\nNow let me pull that all together. McKesson delivered performance above our initial expectations in fiscal 2024, underpinned by continued momentum across the businesses. We finished the year with a growing portfolio of oncology and biopharma services solutions and an expanded core distribution business and a stronger culture that unites us all. As we look ahead to our fiscal 2025, we're excited about the opportunities to grow our differentiated assets and capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our strategies and priorities, and we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable business growth and generate attractive shareholder return. Team McKesson is more focused and more agile as we enter this new fiscal year with strength and confidence. With that, Brett, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2024 marks another year of strong execution and financial performance. We entered fiscal 2025 with the momentum to deliver growth and create value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results. Then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2025 outlook. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results unless I state otherwise. .\nWe're exiting fiscal 2024 with solid performance, delivering earnings per diluted share of $6.18 in the fourth quarter and $27.44 for the full year. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and with the earnings per diluted share guidance range that we provided on our third quarter earnings call, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.\nFor the full year, when excluding fiscal 2023 contributions from COVID-related programs and McKesson Ventures, adjusted operating profit grew 9% and adjusted EPS increased 17%. These results are above our long-range targets and reflect the strength of our products, services and operating execution. Let me start with a review of the fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11% to $76.4 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications.\nGross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7% and primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading plasma and biologics business. Operating expenses increased 11% to $2.1 billion driven by higher costs to support growth across the businesses. During the quarter, we recorded a reserve for environmental matters of $0.09 per share for increased remediation costs related to McKesson's former chemical business which we disposed of several years ago.\nThe environmental reserve was recorded in our corporate segment. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, which was flat to the prior year driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, offset by increased corporate expenses, which included the previously outlined environmental reserve. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs in both the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical Solutions segments when compared to the prior year.\nWhen adjusting for the COVID-19 programs and a modest McKesson Ventures loss in fiscal 2023, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in the quarter. Moving below the line. Interest expense was $75 million, an increase of 7%, driven by higher short-term borrowings of commercial paper compared to the prior year. The higher short-term borrowings resulted from lower average cash balances in part due to the impact from the Change Healthcare outage. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, which is in line with our previous guidance and driven by a discrete tax item.\nFourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $131.6 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, Earnings per diluted share was $6.18, again, in line with the implied earnings per diluted share that we provided on our third quarter earnings call. While this represents a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year.\nFourth quarter results were principally driven by a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 program contributions in fiscal 2024, partially offset by a lower share count and growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Turning now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical.\nRevenues were $68.8 billion, an increase of 12% and driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications. As we have previously guided, GLP-1 medications continue to show growth year-over-year -- despite this increase, the rate of growth continues to moderate. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion or 24% compared to fiscal 2023. However, GLP-1 revenues were flat on a sequential basis.\nFor the quarter, operating profit increased 5% to $901 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program. The creative capabilities and assets continued to deliver robust value to our stakeholders. Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1.2 billion, which were flat to the prior year. Lower contributions from the third-party logistics business were offset by growth across our technology services products and primarily our access solutions.\nWithin this segment, CoverMyMeds continues to deliver value for our partners by increasing connectivity between pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma manufacturers through next-generation access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. Results in the fourth quarter reflect organic growth across our access solutions, including prior authorization services as we extended existing partnerships with biopharma manufacturers.\nIn addition to the strength of our Access Solutions, year-over-year performance was also supported by higher volumes across our affordability solutions. Operating profit decreased 3% to $212 million, driven by higher costs and investments to sustain the momentum and growth across the biopharma services platform. This included incremental infrastructure investments and cost to deliver increasing levels of ROI for our customers.\nOperating profit was also impacted by lower third-party logistics performance in the quarter compared to the prior year. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $248 million, which was flat versus the prior year. Fourth quarter results reflect growth in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses, including higher volumes of illness season testing, partially offset by lower contributions from the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 program compared to the prior year.\nAs a reminder, each on the season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $94 million, an increase of 18%. These strong results were driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year.\nWrapping up our segment review. Corporate expenses were $193 million in the quarter, an increase of 30%, driven by the previously discussed environmental reserve and higher technology infrastructure and compliance spend.\nLet me now turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, including $687 million of capital expenditures, which included new and existing distribution centers as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities.\nDuring the quarter, several of our customers were impacted by the Change Healthcare outage, delaying billing functions and claims payments. This outage created a timing impact on McKesson's cash flows. However, the impact was less severe than we had previously indicated. We continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our stakeholders. In fiscal 2024, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders. We returned $3 billion through share repurchases at an average price per share of approximately $436, including $678 million of share repurchases in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nAdditionally, we paid dividends of $314 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 92% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2024. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we have returned $16.2 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $14.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 36%. The strength of our balance sheet and strong credit metrics, supported by our strong operating performance and disciplined and balanced financial policy was recognized in the quarter by the recent Moody's credit rating upgrade to A3 from BAA1. We are now A rated by 2 of the 3 major credit rating agencies.\nOur strong balance sheet and consistently robust cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a durable capital structure.\nNow let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology and biopharma services, have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last 5 years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook is a continuation of this momentum.\nLet me start with our segments. We anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 19% and operating profit to increase 8% to 10% and propelled by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and growth across our oncology platform. We continue to make investments in the core distribution network to deliver more efficiency and value for our stakeholders. The strength of our value proposition was highlighted by the recent agreement to build on our existing pharmaceutical distribution partnership with Optum.\nThis 5-year contract begins on July 1, 2024. The fiscal 2025 segment outlook incorporates stable, growing prescription utilization trends, bolstered by further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our leading plasma and biologics business. We anticipate further growth from our differentiated oncology platform through the breadth of our assets, U.S. Oncology Network, [indiscernible] and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture.\nAs Brian mentioned, as of April 2024, the U.S. oncology network has grown to approximately 2,600 providers in 31 states, and we're pleased with the advancements we've made with Ontada and Sarah Cannon Research Institute supporting our mission to advance cancer care. We are pleased with the growth we're seeing in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as our assets and capabilities and core distribution and the oncology platform continued to accelerate growth.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 22% and operating profit increased 12% to 16%. This outlook reflects organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand and extend partnerships with biopharma manufacturers and increase the number of brands utilizing our access affordability and adherence programs. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continue to see increased demand for our access and affordability solutions, particularly those related to GLP-1 medications.\nAs a reminder, McKesson's prior authorization products serve the majority of the brands for GLP-1 medications. Our products continue to generate value for our partners. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate that this demand will remain elevated, yet lessen as the rate of increase will be slower than prior years for GLP-1 medications. Medical Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services and assets across all alternate sites of care, including growth in the primary care business and our comprehensive private label portfolio.\nWe anticipate Medical Surgical Solutions revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8%. Within the primary care market, we anticipate continued growth in Lab Solutions and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. Our scale sourcing and distribution footprint has propelled expansion and growth of our private label portfolio, providing superior value for our customers. while maintaining sound economics for McKesson. In fiscal 2025, we're making investments in this segment to support the recent acquisition of [indiscernible], a health care data platform that captures and aggregates data to provide insights and analytics for biopharma.\nWe believe there's an initial use case across the breadth of the Medical Surgical Solutions segment. The Medical Surgical Solutions segment has broad relationships with providers and extensive data sets, meeting opportunities to develop incremental value creation opportunities. Longer term, there are increased opportunities to integrate the capabilities in commercial applications across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will deliver meaningful returns to the segment and to the enterprise.\nIn fiscal 2025, we anticipate that these investments will account for an approximate 2% operating profit headwind in the Medical segment as compared to the prior year. Finally, the international segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 10% year-over-year. Our diversified set of assets within our Canadian business, including the scale distribution business, continues to support growth in the International segment.\nWe continue to make investments in our Canadian technology footprint to create a more custom and integrated supply chain for specialty drugs. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not entered into an agreement to sell and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit.\nIn the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes increased technology spend to support the growth of our businesses and infrastructure and compliance investments. We will also continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We are leveraging AI to increase the efficiency across our operations and increase automation and productivity for our customers. Our investments in AI and other advanced technologies play an important role in improving customer service and provider productivity. We continue to build these tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates.\nOne example where we're implementing AI is in our oncology platform. The [indiscernible] EHR contains structured data that can often be sparsely entered for patients' longitudinal records. Instead, unstructured data such as uploaded documents and provider authored notes, are used to capture details on patients' disease condition in response to treatment as well as many core clinical factors to have complete longitudinal patient records for real-world research core variables are required to be extracted from the unstructured data into a well-organized database.\nNatural language process is the only scalable solution to achieve more than 100 million documents in [indiscernible] today and growing at the rate of 1 million documents per week. The application of AI reduces clinicians exhaustive burden in finding related documents for care and reimbursement workflows, ultimately leading to practice efficiencies and better patient care. This is just one example of many where we're using AI to power insights and deliver clinical and financial value to our stakeholders. We've been pleased with our progress to date as we work to develop and implement various AI technologies, and we remain committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership position and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders.\nNow moving below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $240 million and income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 18% to 20%. And as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance.\nTurning now to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $128 million to $130 million. The strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flows provides the financial flexibility to incrementally invest both organically and inorganically for growth as well as return capital to our shareholders.\nWrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance. We anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 17% and an operating profit growth of 9% to 14% as compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $31.25 to $32.05, which represents growth of 14% to 17% as compared to fiscal 2024. We expect earnings per share will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate the first quarter to have the lowest contribution.\nAs a reminder, we had a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a discrete tax item. In summary, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses. Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution, leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners, and shareholders.\nWe're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. McKesson is well positioned to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. With that, we can move to Q&A."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's Earnings Release and Presentation slides available at our website @investor.mckesson.com and the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and period SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, may in today's earnings release and publication live. The presentation slide also includes summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining our call. McKesson reported a really solid fiscal third quarter, highlighting the continued momentum across the business. We delivered total revenues of $80.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.74, both of which grew by double digits when compared to the prior year.\nAs a result of the recent performance and our latest outlook, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.8 to $27.4 to an updated range of $27.25 to $27.65. This solid financial performance is driven by the focused execution against our company priorities. As a diversified health care services company, we are uniquely positioned to improve Health Care in every setting. This includes the areas of Oncology and Biopharma services.\nWe continue to make significant progress in advancing our strategy and priorities, and pleased to share some of the updates with you today. Let me start where I always like to start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. I start here because it is foundational to everything we do at McKesson.\nIn January, our Board of Directors welcomed Kevin Ozan as a new independent Director. As the former Chief Financial Officer of McDonald's Corporation, Mr. Ozan has over 2 decades of experience in both strategy and finance and will contribute a valuable perspective to our boardroom. We look forward to his leadership as we work together to deliver on our growth initiatives.\nDriving the growth of our company requires a talented and diverse leadership team and equally important, a diverse workforce for each individual is empowered to bring their own opinion, their own ideas and perspectives. Our commitment to best talent and inclusion is reflected in every aspect of our operations. It's how we build a support network for our employees and how we each live these values through everyday interactions. And I'm pleased to see our efforts being recognized.\nFor the 11th consecutive year, McKesson was named as a military-friendly employer. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity, at a quality 100 award winner by the Human Rights Campaign. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a team, and I'm truly grateful to the McKesson employees, who are upholding our culture, values and delivering for all of our stakeholders.\nOur patients, our customers, our partners, our shareholders and importantly, each other. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. In the fiscal third quarter, we saw good performance in our distribution businesses. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, adjusted operating profit grew 6%, reflecting broad-based momentum within the segment. We continue to enhance our scale distribution network, improving efficiency through investments in automation and technology. Over the past year, we opened 2 new distribution centers in the U.S., that are equipped with innovative technology and employee-friendly design. These enhancements will enable our facilities to pick pack and shift medications to customers faster, while simultaneously helping to optimize employee productivity levels by reducing redundant tasks.\nThe investments in our foundational distribution assets continue to support the growth of our business and the success of our customers. During the third quarter, we saw solid volume increases across customer channels, which includes distribution to retail national accounts customers. At the consolidated level, prescription volume growth remains stable. Certain product categories, including specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications, continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute as a tailwind to our revenue growth.\nAs a reminder, we anticipate the growth from GLP-1 medications to slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the Medical Surgical segment, primary care visits showed modest improvement on a sequential basis, after we observed general market moderations last quarter. The improvement was partially driven by overall increase in primary care visits. However, when compared to the prior year, patient visit volumes in the Medical segment remain a headwind to this quarter's performance.\nIn the International segment, our Canadian business continues to perform well. It has a valuable portfolio of assets, including pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies, digital offerings, we're committed to strengthen and grow the business there. And as a part of that commitment, we're executing on a multiyear initiative that will modernize the distribution centers across Canada and deliver significant value to our employees and customers.\nLet me now continue on to talk about our Oncology and Biopharma platforms. We continue to build on the foundation of our distribution capabilities, but we have strategically assembled a differentiated set of assets in Oncology and Biopharma services. Within the Oncology business, the U.S. Oncology Network expanded its footprint by entering the state of Tennessee.\nOver the past quarter, we welcomed 2 new practices, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology partners to the network. Through the combination of onboarding new practices and organic growth, the U.S. Oncology Network has grown its provider base to over 2,500, spreading across nearly 600 sites in 30 states. The expansion of the network strengthened our unique market position in community-based oncology practices and demonstrates our strong value proposition to providers.\nThrough the U.S. Oncology Network, we provide a range of comprehensive solutions to ease the administrative and operational burden and to help enable the success of these community practices. In the past quarter, we started integrating new artificial intelligence capabilities into the network, assisting providers with revenue cycle management and evaluating clinical solutions. With the help of AI and machine learning technologies, practices will be able to navigate complex insurance coverage and reimbursement processes more efficiently, allowing providers to spend more time focused on their patients.\nWithin the Biopharma Services business, we continue to see strong market demand for our differentiated solutions that help improve access, affordability and adherence to medications. In the third quarter -- or this fiscal third quarter, the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered strong performance, primarily driven by the growth in Access Solutions, including prior authorization solutions for Branded Pharmaceuticals, such as GLP-1 medications.\nToday, we provide prior authorization services for the vast majority of the GLP-1 medications in the market. Our integrated technology streamlines the prior authorization process and helps overcome medication access challenges that patients are facing. The main customers we serve are biopharma companies and through our scaled network connection, we can electronically process requests both at the pharmacy counter and the provider's offices.\nThe prior authorization solution is an example of the power of our capabilities and as part of a broader portfolio of patient support services we provide. We believe our solutions are highly differentiated and provide value to all stakeholders through a patient's journey. We're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 900,000 providers. The scale of our network provides a strong foundation that enables us to reach key stakeholders effectively and seamlessly. The integrated solutions we offer can often be accessed through a single digital entry point.\nFor our Biopharma customers, the integration helps streamline workflows and increase transparency into how programs work together. In the past quarter, our team has been working diligently to prepare for what we call the Blizzard Season. For the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest time of the year, due to customer annual verification activities. The annual reset of insurance policies typically drives a large influx of seasonal volumes for many of our programs.\nEach year, our teams come together to tackle the challenge of these significant volume increases. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver another successful blizzard season that is in line with our expectations. Our products and solutions in both Oncology and Biopharma Services provide significant value to our customers, as reflected in the continued growth of these businesses. We're excited about the market opportunities in both areas, and we're confident in the scale and depth of our assets and expertise. We will continue to invest and innovate to support the evolving needs of our customers and their patients.\nSo let me pull it all together. McKesson reported another solid quarter in fiscal 2024, that allowed us to raise and narrow our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share. We're committed to our shareholders to delivering long-term sustainable growth, and this quarter's results reflect the continued progress in delivering on our commitment. Health Care is an ever-evolving market. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we never stopped finding new ways to drive positive impacts on our customers and their patients. I want to thank the over 50,000 McKesson employees, who are working so tirelessly to advance our mission. And with that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insight and comments.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our fiscal third quarter 2024 results, which reflect another quarter of solid momentum with growth across our North American businesses. Our results exceeded expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.\nBefore I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our third quarter GAAP only results. We recorded an additional pretax GAAP provision for bad debt of $515 million or $381 million after tax, within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. This provision is for uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid in October of 2023, prior to its bankruptcy petition filing.\nWe continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid through an interim distribution agreement, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence, as we have for over 20 years. We're closely monitoring developments. Rite Aids bankruptcy will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results. The remainder of my comments will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results.\nLet me start with a review of the fiscal third quarter. McKesson delivered solid growth in the third quarter, led by sustained strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. This year-over-year growth underscores operating execution across our diversified and differentiated portfolio, including investments in Oncology and Biopharma Services. As a result of the third quarter operating performance and our confidence in the business, we're increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share, to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65.\nLet me move to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 15% to $80.9 billion. Led by continued strong utilization trends, growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures within McKesson's European business.\nExcluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 3%. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures and the impact from the U.S. government COVID-19 programs in fiscal 2023, gross profit increased 10%.\nOperating expenses increased 4% in the quarter, due to higher costs to support growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Third quarter operating profit decreased 9% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal 2023 results included a pretax benefit of $126 million, related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare.\nYear-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs, which were mitigated by contributions from commercial COVID-19 distribution and a nonrecurring $30 million charge in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. These items were partially offset by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segment.\nWhen adjusting for these items, including $126 million or $0.65 benefit from the early termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 7% in the quarter.\nMoving below the line, interest expense was $58 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year, driven by effective management of our loan portfolio. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%, resulting from the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items.\nThird quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $133.3 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Consolidated third quarter earnings per diluted share was $7.74, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year. This increase includes the impacts of approximately $0.63 related to the U.S. government COVID-19 program and the $0.65 benefit from the termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and increased commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution and a nonrecurring charge in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2024.\nTurning to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slide 7 through 11, and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. During the quarter, we experienced volume increases across all product categories and customer channels. Specialty Pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications continue to grow at a faster pace compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenues were $73 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications.\nIn the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $2.8 billion or 60%, compared to fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we also noted increased contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In our fiscal third quarter, commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution peaked in October, then declined significantly in November and December. We do not anticipate material contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nFor the third quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $828 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023 and commercial COVID-19 distribution in fiscal 2024 and the $30 million nonrecurring charge in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, delivered operating profit growth of 8% year-over-year.\nIn our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications and new brand launches led to increased demand for our access solutions, such as prior authorization services. For the third quarter, revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, and operating profit increased 25% to $193 million. Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes which drove higher demand for our access solutions, principally prior authorization services and growth in our third-party logistics business.\nIn addition to the strength of prior authorization services, Year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions.\nTurning to Medical Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%, primarily driven by growth in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses, partially offset by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, compared to the prior year.\nIn the third quarter, Primary Care patient visits moderately increased on a sequential basis. Demand for commercialized COVID-19 vaccine distribution, across the alternate sites of care that we serve, was also modestly higher compared to prior expectations. The overall illness season dynamics, including vaccinations and testing continue to be an operating profit headwind in the quarter when compared to the prior year.\nAs a reminder, each illness season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Operating profit was $282 million, a decrease of 16%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. And a softer illness season as compared to fiscal 2023.\nWhen excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses.\nNext, let me address our International results. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by divestitures with McKesson's European business. Partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in Canada. Operating profit was $105 million, a decrease of 27%, driven by divestitures within the McKesson's European business.\nWrapping up our segment review. Corporate expenses were $147 million in the quarter, which included losses of $8 million or $0.05 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains and losses. The timing and magnitude which can vary for each investment.\nWe remain pleased with the insights and the results that we're obtaining through this portfolio. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, corporate expenses in the third quarter decreased 5% year-over-year.\nTurning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $100 million in the third quarter and $2.9 billion for the trailing 12 months. Third quarter free cash flow was impacted by the Rite Aid bankruptcy in October and its associated $725 million provision for bad debts.\nAs a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing. Which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and, therefore, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we made capital expenditure investments of $418 million, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities.\nYear-to-date, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders. which included $2.3 billion of share repurchases and $232 million in dividend payments. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation.\nLet me start with the fiscal 2024 outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 18% and operating profit increased 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. And the impact of elevated commercial COVID-19 distribution in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 accounts for approximately 2% of segment growth.\nThe updated segment revenue outlook incorporates the strong third quarter performance and continued growth in specialty distribution, supported by stable utilization trends. Revenue growth assumes that GLP-1 medication volumes will continue to be robust, although the rate of growth will moderate in our fiscal fourth quarter. These medications are lower margins and represent a headwind to year-over-year operating profit growth.\nOur full year operating profit growth also reflects our leading generics program, which continues to deliver on the dual mandate of lower cost and product availability. And we continue to be pleased with the strength of our scaled and broad Oncology platform. This quarter, as Brian mentioned, we expanded into Tennessee with the addition of 2 practices. With these additions and organic growth, U.S. Oncology is now over 2,500 providers.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 9% to 13%, and we've increased our operating profit growth outlook to 24% to 28%, reflecting strong third quarter performance, continued organic growth and higher transaction volumes across the access and affordability solutions. The quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment is driven by prescription and transaction volumes, the timing, pace and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nOur Medical Surgical Solutions segment continues to be a leader across all the alternate sites of Care. We anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 4% growth and operating profit to decrease 11% to 15%. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Our updated outlook incorporates the third quarter results that I discussed earlier, which reflect a modest improvement in sequential Primary Care traffic.\nFinally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 29% to 33%. And operating profit to decline by 21% to 26%, reflecting divestitures within McKesson's European business that closed during fiscal 2023. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $615 million to $655 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, recorded in the first 9 months of the year and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our business.\nMoving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $230 million and income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million. We anticipate no change to the full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%. The timing of discrete tax item is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance.\nTurning to cash flow and capital deployment. We now anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of the quarter. Our outlook also incorporates the impact of the October Rite Aid bankruptcy. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $134 million.\nWrapping up fiscal 2024 guidance. As a result of solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, combined with our momentum and confidence moving forward, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024, to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. We anticipate operating profit will be a 2% decline to 1% growth compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by approximately 8% to 11% year-over-year, above the long-term target range.\nAs a reminder, certain items include the following: $1.90 related to fiscal 2023 U.S. government COVID-19 program and COVID-19 tests, in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical segments. A $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024.\nThe increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates growth of 16% to 18%, when excluding these certain items. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2025. The momentum we've seen across our business over the past several years is expected to continue in fiscal 2025. We anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical Solutions segments will be more closely aligned to the long-term growth targets, that we've previously provided for these segments, demonstrating our leading market positions and stable financial performance.\nWe anticipate that the strength we're seeing across our solution set and prescription technology solutions, will lead to growth at the top end or slightly above the long-term target. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, we remain confident in our long-term target of 5% to 7% growth, supported by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and across our Oncology platform. The U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute.\nAs the leader in the alternate site market, we believe that the Medical Surgical Solutions segment is well positioned as Care continues to move across the alternate site settings. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture the growth opportunity in the years ahead. We anticipate that the Prescription Technology Solutions segment may perform modestly above the long-term growth target of 11% to 12%, driven by organic growth, as we expand our higher-margin Biopharma Services platform.\nFor the International segment, we anticipate continued growth in our Canadian operations. And throughout fiscal 2023, we completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries that we operated in Europe. As a reminder, Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell and we intend to exit Norway, as part of the completion of our European exit.\nFinally, we will continue to materially invest in the business on multiple fronts. We will sustain the pace and cadence of investment in product development and enhancements across our Oncology and Biopharma Services platforms. These investments will further our differentiated capabilities and market-leading positions. We will also continue to invest in adding capacity and capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation and regulatory excellence capabilities. And we will continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence.\nWe see AI as unlocking the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. Although in the early stages, we're using AI to improve patient intake and workflow, improve productivity throughout the system, including automatic clinical note generation and several supply chain use cases, including supply chain disruption predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms and fraud detection. Although we're in the early stages of our AI development and implementation, we're committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders.\nTo sum up, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business. We're pleased with our strong fiscal 2024 performance, and we remain optimistic about the outlook. McKesson is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results, as we successfully executed against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. And with that, let's move to our Q&A session."

Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you joining us on our call today. We're very pleased to report another solid quarter in fiscal 2024 with adjusted results above expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create sustained value for our shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, revenues increased 10% to $77.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.23. When excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 14% from the prior year. Our performance through the first half of the fiscal year, combined with the continued momentum in advancing our company strategies, gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Our previous guidance range of $26.55 to $27.35 has been updated to a range of $26.80 to $27.40.\nMcKesson continues to deliver on our mission of improving care in every setting. As a diversified health care services company, we're making important progress in strengthening our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing more value to our customers and their patients. Before I turn my attention to our company priorities and the second quarter results, I want to briefly discuss Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy proceedings. We have been supplying Rite Aid with the majority of their pharmaceutical products for more than 20 years. As they navigate through their reorganization process, we are working closely with them to provide continued delivery of products. We're closely monitoring developments. But as Britt will describe in his remarks, we anticipate that Rite Aid's bankruptcy filing will not materially impact fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nNow let me move on to our company priorities, and I want to start by recognizing our people, including the diverse, dedicated and talented team we've built here at McKesson. Investing in people and culture is foundational to our strategy, and we offer many engagement programs and initiatives to empower our employees and allow them to express new ideas to contribute their unique perspectives and to care for each other. We firmly believe that we achieve our full potential when our culture is diverse, inclusive and focused on best talent. Our efforts fostering a culture of belonging are well recognized. Recently, we were honored to be named by Forbes as 1 of America's Best Employers for Women. And for the eighth consecutive year, we were named as 1 of the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a top ranking score of 100. We appreciate all the hard work and dedication from Team McKesson, and we recognize the importance of helping, respecting and caring for each other.\nOn October 27, we celebrated our annual Wellness Day called Your Day, Your Way. This is the third year that we've celebrated this tradition and shown appreciation for our employees by providing them with additional day off work to prioritize their personal health and well-being.\nLet's take a minute to review the performance of the Distribution business and the progress we've made driving sustainable core growth. In the second quarter, we saw strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Over the past 10 quarters, the segment has consistently delivered double-digit revenue increases, demonstrating our ability to serve and grow with our customers. In the second quarter, we continued to observe solid prescription volume trends particularly in the category of GLP-1 medications, which contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. And over the past 3 years, we were honored to support the U.S. government as the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines. Our team demonstrated incredible agility and dedication in standing up a fit-for-purpose operation distributing vaccines across the country.\nThis past September, we started transitioning the COVID-19 vaccine distribution to commercial channels. We're working closely with the manufacturers to bring vaccines to patients in an efficient and timely manner. As 1 of the largest distributors of flu vaccines in the country, we have scaled channel reach and deep expertise in working with vaccine products. And I'm pleased to say that through October 20, we have distributed nearly 8 million COVID-19 vaccines through our commercial channels.\nIn the Medical-Surgical segment, we continue to support our customers' evolving needs with a diversified portfolio of products and broad experience in medical, surgical and related supplies. As a reminder, while we serve many alternate site providers, the biggest channel within the segment is primary care, including physician offices. We closely track market data and during the second quarter, we observed general market moderations in primary care foot traffic. We also saw a year-over-year decline in instances of respiratory illness and flu, which contributed to lower illness testing and patient visits in the primary care business. These dynamics impacted the segment results in the second quarter and our full year fiscal 2024 outlook. However, we remain confident in the fundamentals of the business and the strength of our scaled assets within the Medical-Surgical segment.\nMoving on to the next company priority of expanding our oncology and biopharma platforms. Since the beginning of this calendar year, we've added 4 new practices and welcomed hundreds of new providers to the US Oncology network. The team is working hard to ensure that the new practices are leveraging the resources of the network, including best practices, coordinated resources, technology and infrastructure. As an important element of the integration, all of the new practices will be operating on the same electronic health record, or EHR system, we call [ iKnowMed ]. Designed in close collaboration with oncologists, iKnowMed serves as an important link between the US Oncology Network and Ontada, our data and insights business. Powered by the innovative technology from Ontada, iKnowMed creates powerful insights and provides comprehensive point-of-care treatment decision support to providers. More than 2,600 providers across the country use iKnowMed as their EHR. And we are pleased to see iKnowMed being honored as a top-ranked medical oncology EHR in the 2023 Best-in-Class report.\nIn addition to technology solutions like iKnowMed, Ontada continues to advance its mission of transforming the fight against cancer. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration awarded Ontada a contract to advance the use of real-world data in the U.S. community oncology setting, which is a good opportunity to identify insights that will inform care and clinical research.\nMoving on to the biopharma services platform. Through strategic acquisitions and investments, we've built a set of highly differentiated assets within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment. The combination of these assets creates a powerful and scaled network that includes multiple touch points throughout the patient treatment journey. We are connected to approximately 900,000 providers, enabling solutions that help move barriers to access prescription medications. We're also connected to over 50,000 pharmacies, helping patients afford their prescriptions through solutions like cash co-pay and digital coupons right at the pharmacy counter.\nIn the second quarter, we were pleased with the strong performance in the segment with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit, driven by growth in Access Solutions, including increased volumes and prior authorizations for GLP-1 medications. The year-over-year comparison was also partially impacted by lower prior year results, which, as we called out in Q2 of our fiscal 2023, included higher operating expenses resulting from the timing of increased headcount to support customer annual verification activities.\nOne of the areas where we saw significant growth in the past 2 quarters is our access solutions, including prior authorizations for brands like GLP-1 medications. For selected prescription drugs, patients are required to obtain approval from their health plan, which sometimes can be very manual and cumbersome. What we offer is an automated technology solution that is embedded within the providers' workflow. Our technology solution introduces efficiency to the process. More than 40% of our prior authorizations are approved instantly, and approximately 65% are approved within 1 hour. We continue to add new features and functionalities to improve the user experience. The latest feature introduced allows providers to share prior authorization outcomes directly with their patients when a health plan makes a determination. Through improvements like this, we help remove barriers and provide greater patient visibility to the prior authorization process.\nSolutions like prior authorizations are great examples of the success of our business strategy. It's also a reflection of our efforts to improve medication access and ultimately, advanced health outcomes for all. As an impact-driven organization, we're deeply committed to advancing our strategy and contributing to positive changes in the communities where we live and work.\nThis past quarter, we celebrated our community impact days, which is McKesson's largest annual company-wide employee volunteer event. Thousands of McKesson employees participated in various community impact projects that align with this year's theme, cancer awareness, prevention and support. This year marked the 25th anniversary of the event, and we will continue honoring this tradition and we'll work to find more ways to enhance the health of those who live in our communities.\nSo let me pull everything together. McKesson delivered a solid second quarter. Thanks to the contribution and dedication of over 50,000 McKesson employees, we continue to execute against our company priorities with focus and excellence. Leveraging our differentiated services and solutions, we're well positioned to continue to improve care in every setting. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to drive continued growth and strategic advancement in fiscal 2024 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt for additional comments.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian. We're pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect another quarter of solid performance, driven by operational execution and meaningful growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.\nBefore I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight 1 item that impacted our second quarter GAAP-only results. We recorded a pretax GAAP provision for bad debt of $210 million or $155 million after tax within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment for uncollected trade accounts receivable related to Rite Aid's bankruptcy. We anticipate recording an additional provision for bad debt of $511 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 for trade accounts receivable that McKesson recognized from sales to Rite Aid in October 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition.\nWe continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid post their bankruptcy filing, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're operating pursuant to an interim agreement for distribution services, which is pending final court approval, and includes reduced credit terms of 7 days and certain other items as Rite Aid continues to reorganize. We are closely monitoring developments, and we anticipate this customer event will not have a material impact to fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results, our liquidity position and ongoing business operations.\nThe remainder of my comments refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results, unless I state otherwise. Let me start with a review of our second quarter results. McKesson delivered solid growth in the second quarter, led by strong performance in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Our focus and execution against our company priorities position us to generate consistent, solid financial results while continuing to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our operating performance and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $26.80 to $27.40.\nMoving to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 10% to $77.2 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes for the retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medication, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures of certain [ testing ] European businesses. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, revenue increased 15%.\nGross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 1%. And when excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, second quarter gross profit increased 8%, primarily a result of growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. And excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year, which included approximately 2% from costs related to the second half fiscal 2023 acquisitions of Rx Savings Solutions and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute.\nSecond quarter operating profit increased 1% to $1.2 billion, again, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. This was partially offset by slower growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, including lower illness season testing and the completed divestitures of our European business operations within the International segment. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items of fiscal 2023 and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 12% in the quarter.\nMoving below the line. The effective tax rate was 23.5%, which included the recognition of a net discrete tax expense of $12 million. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 134.8 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Consolidated second quarter earnings per diluted share were $6.23, which represents an increase of 3% over the prior year. Excluding COVID-19-related items during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, second quarter earnings per diluted share was up 14% over the prior year.\nTurning to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting in U.S. Pharmaceutical. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered continued momentum and strong operating profit growth. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this segment reflects a few factors: the efficiency of our scaled distribution operations, the investments that we're making to unlock new capabilities that will further expand and strengthen our value proposition for our customers and partners, a balanced approach to managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products, inclusive of our [ ClarusONE ] on generic sourcing operations, bolstering our competitive position and enabling a nimble approach to customer demand, new product launches and market movements and continued investment in expansion in our broad oncology platform. We are pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets from provider solutions in the US oncology network, data and insights through Ontada and expanded clinical trial capabilities through our Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture. These assets contributed to revenue and operating profit results in the quarter which exceeded our expectations.\nSecond quarter revenues were $69.8 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Revenue growth reflects an increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications. These increases were partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. The growth of GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. As a reminder, we generally recognize lower margin rates for the distribution of GLP-1 medications in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\nIn our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications, like [ uterine ] brand launches, has led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services. Second quarter U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit increased 8% to $815 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products and increased contributions from our generic programs. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year.\nMoving to Prescription Technology Solutions. The strong results in the second quarter demonstrate the success of our product portfolio and the partnership with biopharma manufacturers that we've developed over the years. The strength of our differentiated capabilities and partnerships position McKesson to capture demand driven by strong prescription utilization trends, including the growth of GLP-1 medications. For the second quarter, revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, and operating profit increased 48% to $209 million. Second quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions primarily related to prior authorization services and growth in our third-party logistics business. The year-over-year growth also included higher operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which resulted from the timing of increased headcount to support customer annual verification activities.\nIn Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.8 million in the quarter, which was flat to the prior year, resulting from anticipated lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from [ caging ], storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. The anticipated lower COVID-19-related revenues were partially offset by growth in the extended care business and increased distribution of pharmaceuticals in the primary care business. Operating profit was $254 million, a decrease of 17%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from [ caging ] store and distribution of ancillary supplies from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and lower sales of COVID-19 tests. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 5%, driven by increased volumes in nutritional supplements in the extended care business.\nBased on IQVIA and other market indications, the second quarter exhibited moderated primary care market volumes. The Medical-Surgical Solutions second quarter growth rate reflects these market indications, which was partially related to a slower start to the illness season, including illness season testing when compared to the prior year.\nNext, let me address our International results. Revenues in the second quarter were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 44% year-over-year. And operating profit was $89 million, a decrease of 35%. Second quarter results reflect the year-over-year effects of the completed divestitures within our European business. In wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $159 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had losses of $10 million or $0.06 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to losses of approximately $3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, the McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies. We're pleased with the insights and the results that we are obtaining through this portfolio. The impacts on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment.\nTurning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $825 million in the second quarter and $4.3 billion for the trailing 12 months. Our cash balance and free cash flow in the second quarter included payments totaling $529 million associated with settlement agreements for opioid-related claims. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that the quarter ends on, and therefore, can vary from quarter-to-quarter.\nDuring the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we made $264 million of capital expenditures, which included investments in new and existing distribution centers as well investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $149 million in dividend payments.\nNow let me discuss our updated outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. The guidance I'm providing today relates to fiscal 2024. [indiscernible] our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation.\nLet me start with the outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 13% to 15% and operating profit increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. This updated segment outlook incorporates the strong second quarter performance as well as further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics business. Our full year outlook assumes that volumes related to GLP-1 medications will remain elevated compared to the prior year and may vary quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate the consolidated GLP-1 medication revenue and operating profit growth compared to prior year will slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nWe anticipate GLP-1 medications will continue to be a revenue tailwind for U.S. Pharmaceutical. However, distribution of these medications has a lower distribution margin rate profile and represents a headwind to prior year results. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13%. We have increased our operating profit growth outlook to 18% to 22%, reflecting strong momentum in our Access Solutions and strong first half performance. We may continue to see quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment, driven by prescription and transaction volumes, the timing, pace and trajectory to new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains well positioned across all alternate site channels with unmatched scale, product assortment and capabilities. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 2% decline to 2% growth and operating profit to decrease 12% to 16%. For the full year, we anticipate volumes of COVID-19 tests to continue to decline compared to fiscal 2023. And the impact from COVID-19-related items will remain immaterial to fiscal 2024 results. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 5% to 7% year-over-year.\nOur outlook incorporates the second quarter results which I discussed earlier. We anticipate the general market moderations in primary care foot traffic, in part driven by a modest illness season, may persist through the remainder of fiscal 2024. Additionally, first half fiscal 2023 results benefited from an extended illness season, which did not repeat in fiscal 2024. Our outlook includes continued investments in our scaled distribution network, adding state-of-the-art automation and regulatory capabilities to serve the breadth of our customer base. These distribution network investments support the breadth of our non-acute customers and broader cold chain distribution, for example, COVID vaccines for physician offices. We also anticipate further investments in data and analytics to expand the channel reach for our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and private brand product portfolio.\nFinally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from European businesses and transactions that we closed during fiscal 2023. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $660 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investment recorded in the first half of the year and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our businesses.\nMoving below the line, we anticipate the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19%. The timing of discrete tax items is difficult to predict, and therefore, we typically do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. However, our outlook includes recognition of a discrete tax benefit in our fiscal third quarter. As a result, we anticipate the third quarter tax rate to be lower as compared to the fourth quarter. And finally, we now anticipate income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $155 million to $175 million, reflecting [ ClarusONE's ] generic sourcing success.\nTurning to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 134 million.\nIn summary, as a result of solid performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, combined with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 to a new range of $26.80 to $27.40. We anticipate operating profit will be flat to 4% decline compared to the prior year. When excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit increase by 6% to 10% year-over-year.\nAs a reminder, certain items include the following: net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024; a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023; and $1.90 related to COVID-19-related items in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segment in fiscal 2023. We anticipate the impact of COVID-19-related items will be immaterial in fiscal 2024 when comparing fiscal 2023.\nThe increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates earnings per diluted share growth of 14% to 17% when excluding these certain items. When further excluding the contribution from the runoff of our European operations, earnings per diluted share growth is indicated at 18% to 20% for the full year. We also anticipate the fiscal third quarter to be stronger than the fiscal fourth quarter based on the development of prescription transactions, patient visits, internal investments and the recognition of a discrete tax benefit in the third quarter.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our strong first half performance. The momentum across the business, including growth in our oncology and biopharma services platforms, positions us to deliver for our customers and our partners and to create sustainable shareholder value. And with that, let's move to the Q&A."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we'll move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides.

Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you joining us on our call today. McKesson reported a strong fiscal first quarter, driven by really broad-based momentum across the businesses. We delivered $74.5 billion in total revenues and $7.27 in adjusted earnings per diluted share, both exceeding our expectations.\nThe performance in the quarter included [indiscernible] impact from a discrete tax item. But the thing we're most importantly focused on and pleased with is the strong operational performance of the underlying business, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.10 to $26.90 to an updated range of $26.55 and to $27.35.\nBefore I review our business performance in the quarter, I want to provide an update on the utilization trends that we've been observing. In the first quarter, we saw solid growth in prescription volumes and patient visits. In U.S. Oncology, same-store patient visits grew at a good pace while we continued to expand the reach of the network.\nThe solid growth in prescription volume trends, particularly in weight loss or GLP-1 drugs contributed to the strong revenue growth in the first quarter. As we closely monitor the trends going forward, we are well positioned to deliver products and services to support the evolving needs of our customers and patients.\nNow let me move on to our business review, and I want to focus my remarks today on the progress we've made in executing on our company priorities and our differentiated market positions in the key growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. I'll also discuss some of the key growth drivers for the [indiscernible]. As always, Britt will provide additional details about our financial results. So let's start with our priority of driving sustainable core growth.\nIn the first quarter, we saw strong performance in the pharmaceutical distribution business, as reflected in the growth of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, where revenue increased 18% and adjusted operating profit grew 14% when excluding the contribution from COVID-19-related items in the prior year. We're pleased with the broad-based momentum across all customer channels, really, including higher volumes from retail national accounts and good growth in our health systems segment.\nWe also have a long history of supporting and investing in the growth of community pharmacies. In May, we launched pinpoint community [indiscernible], a new inventory management system powered by our proprietary Supplylogix software that's designed to help independent pharmacies improve cash flow, increase inventory efficiency and to maximize their operational performance.\nIn June, we were proud to host the annual ideaShare Conference, a nationwide community pharmacy event that brought together more than 2,800 attendees. Through this form of discussion and education, we help pharmacists foster deeper community connections, strengthen their collective voice and discover ways to innovate and thrive using McKesson products and services.\nTo support the sustainable growth of the core distribution businesses within U.S. Pharmaceutical, we're also investing in our infrastructure to enhance automation and improve efficiency. In the past quarter, we opened a new distriction center dedicated to specialty pharmaceuticals. This new facility incorporates the latest innovations in supply chain automation and technology. And it'll allow us to better serve our customers with increased productivity.\nIn the Medical-Surgical segment, we're dedicated to serving customers across alternate sites of care, and we continue to look for opportunities for new partnerships. In the past 2 years, we've partnered closely with the U.S. government on important public health initiatives. And we're really quite proud of the relationships we've built at both the state and the federal level through these close collaborations.\nSince then, we've grown our state government business through participation in cooperative purchasing programs. We've also built a dedicated government solutions team stacked with experienced sales, customer service, sales administration and legal teams with a shared goal of supporting successful government procurement and providing best-in-class fulfillment and service at every level of the government.\nAs we expand our customer relationships, we're also strategically managing relationships with manufacturers to ensure supply chain diversity. We serve a broad portfolio of national brand and private label Medical-Surgical products, and we're enhancing our procurement tools and processes to better track domestic and international sourcing.\nLast year, our sourcing team traveled to more than 10 countries, representing our continued effort to expand our manufacturing relationships and diversify our geographic presence. Let me move on to the next company priority, and that is expanding our oncology and biopharma platforms. In July, we were excited to welcome the Cancer Care of Kansas to the U.S. oncology network, growing the total number of providers in the network to over 2,400.\nThe continued growth is a strong testament to the value proposition of the network and an example of how we continue to evolve and grow our portfolio of differentiated assets. With over 20 years of oncology practice management experience, the network brings significant value beyond just drug purchase savings. The practices in the network have access to substantial expertise and ample resources, including clinical and business services, innovative technologies that support high-quality patient care, efficient drug management and revenue cycle optimization.\nAs one of the largest organizations of its kind, the U.S. oncology network is dedicated to advancing cancer care and enabling better patient outcomes. Since its initial participation in the oncology care model, more than 120,000 patients have been enrolled in the program across the network. Participating practices delivered high-quality care to patients while generating significant savings for Medicare.\nRecently, we announced the network's participation in the enhancing oncology model, which includes representation from over 70% of the physicians in the network. The U.S. oncology network continues to lead at the forefront of value-based care. In biopharma services, the success of our innovative products and solutions is reflected in the growth we delivered in the first quarter.\nPrescription Technology Solutions segment saw a 17% revenue increase and 35% increase in adjusted operating profit. We continue to receive positive feedback on our products, enabling us to further penetrate the market and expand our channel reach. Solid prescription trends, particularly the commercial success of the weight loss GLP-1 drugs, as I mentioned earlier, also led to higher demand for our prior authorization solutions and contributed to the strong performance in the quarter.\nWe remain committed and focused on expanding the biopharma services platform as one of our strategic growth pillars. We continue to strengthen the relationships with biopharma companies who are the primary sponsor of this business. We're also creating comprehensive value proposition for each of the stakeholders in the continuum of care.\nFor providers, our industry-leading technology platforms help them understand the patient's progression along their treatment journey and help the patients access their therapies faster. Through our electronic payer connections, we support payers who represent 94% of prescription volumes in the U.S. and offer real-time decisions and simplified support between providers and health plans.\nWe're also connected to more than 50,000 pharmacies, and we offer solutions like automatic coupon programs and central field distribution, helping them improve operational efficiency and ultimately, helping their patients lead healthier lives. Recently, we were honored to receive the 2023 Retail Excellence Awards from Drugstore News recognizing the value of our retail solutions and what they bring to pharmacies.\nAs we continue to make significant progress in our company priorities, I want to highlight our unwavering focus on our people and culture. We, at McKesson, believe that having the best talent is essential, and it's foundational to our culture and strategies. As a company, we further defined our employee value proposition. We call it the future of health starts with you to demonstrate our commitment to our employees and what makes McKesson a top employer.\nFocusing on care, meaning and belonging, we strive to build a culture that supports the well-being and growth of each individual who works at McKesson. We also offer employees the opportunity to form authentic connections and advocate for advancing the company's culture through employee resource groups. We're pleased to see the ERG membership grew by more than 70% in the past 2 years.\nSupported by increased employee participation, these resource groups are becoming an important channel to promote and strengthen our culture of inclusion, belonging and collaboration. Our focus on people and culture is an important pillar of our company's priorities, and it's also part of our broader initiative focused on enacting positive and lasting impact.\nWe strive to deliver value to our customers and our communities not only as a diversified health care services company, but also as an impact-driven organization. In June, we published our FY '22 and FY '23 impact report that detailed our progress in advancing our strategy and driving meaningful outcomes to build a healthier tomorrow for all future generations.\nWe shared many great initiatives focused on making an impact through our 4 impact pillars: our people, our partners, our community and our planet. I'm very, very proud of what the team has achieved, and we'll continue to track, measure and communicate our progress around these impact pillars. Now before I hand it over to Britt, let me pull everything together.\nMcKesson delivered a strong first quarter, and we're making consistent and meaningful progress with our company priorities. We're pleased with the growth and momentum across the business segments, and the market fundamentals remain solid in support of the positive outlook we've outlined for fiscal 2024. I want to sincerely thank all of the McKesson employees.\nWe refer to them as Team McKesson. What we have achieved would not be possible without their dedication and the commitment of each and every one of them. I'm tremendously proud to be your leader and grateful for your contributions to advancing our vision. With that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you for additional insights.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nWell, thank you, Brian, and I'm pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss our fiscal first quarter results, which, as you mentioned, are tracking above the full year guidance that we provided in May, and it reflects solid progress against our long-term growth targets. Given the strong start to the year and momentum across the business, we're raising both our top and bottom line guidance today.\nI'll first start with a review of our first quarter results and provide an overview of our fiscal 2024 outlook, including our updated adjusted earnings per diluted share range. My comments today will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results, unless I state otherwise. Let me start with a review of our consolidated results.\nConsolidated revenues increased 11% to $74.5 billion, which was led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and weight loss or GLP-1 drugs. And they are partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from completed divestitures within our European business during fiscal 2023.\nWhen excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $2.9 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 2%. And when excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7% in the first quarter, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.\nOperating expenses decreased 4% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter included integration costs related to our acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions and a joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute, both of which were completed in the second half of fiscal 2023.\nFirst quarter operating profit increased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in our North American businesses, partially offset by the completed divestitures of our European business operations, which are within our International segment. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items in fiscal 2023 and losses associated with McKesson Venture equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 9% in the quarter.\nWe're pleased with the strong operating results, which are above the long-range growth targets. We're delivering durable operating performance and sustained momentum, and we're executing against our strategies. Moving below the line, interest expense was $42 million, a year-over-year decrease, driven by transactions within our long-term debt portfolio, which I'll discuss later in my remarks.\nThe effective tax rate was 8.4%, driven by the recognition of a net discrete tax benefit of $147 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 related to the repatriation of certain intellectual property between wholly-owned legal entities that were based in different tax jurisdictions. As a reminder, the timing of discrete tax items is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance.\nOur effective tax rate guidance for the full year remains unchanged. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $136.6 million -- 136.6 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Adding it all up, first quarter earnings per diluted share of $7.27 represents an increase of 25% over the prior year.\nWhen excluding COVID-19-related items in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, first quarter earnings per diluted share was up 33% over the prior year. Turning to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenue and operating profit results in the quarter exceeded our expectations.\nFirst quarter revenues were $67.2 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Revenue growth reflected increased prescription transaction volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. The growth of the weight loss or the GLP-1 drug category provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter.\nWe generally recognized lower margin rates for the distribution of GLP-1 drugs. The growth of these products, similar to other new brand launches, led to increased demand for our access and affordability support programs such as our prior authorization services, which are offered within RxTS segment. The first quarter also marked further progress against our oncology growth strategy. We're pleased with the growth across all of our oncology assets.\nWe saw growth in the U.S. oncology network, supported by the strength of our GPO capabilities. And as Brian mentioned, recently, we added Cancer Center of Kansas to the U.S. oncology network, expanding the total number of providers in our network to over 2,400. During the quarter, we delivered solid performance and contribution from the U.S. Oncology network. First quarter fiscal 2024 total patient visits were 19% above the prior year.\nAnd on a same practice basis, U.S. oncology patient visits grew approximately 7% above the prior year. The joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute is progressing well. as we support the expansion and the advancement of clinical trials and clinical trial research, and we continue to invest in and progress our data and insights business on Tata.\nThese oncology assets and capabilities are important pieces to the long-term development of this segment, and we're excited about the growth and the continued progress that we're seeing. First quarter U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit increased 8% to $771 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics programs, which included new product launches within the quarter.\nWhen excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 14% year-over-year, ahead of the segment's long-term growth target. U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit growth reflects increased prescription volumes and the breadth of capabilities that we provide, including solid generic volumes and sourcing contributions, operating discipline and the continued momentum from our oncology platform.\nLet me move now to Prescription Technology Solutions. First quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in our third-party logistics and technology services businesses due to increased prescription volumes. Operating profit increased 35% to $223 million, driven by increasing demand for our access, adherence and affordability solutions.\nAs I mentioned earlier in my remarks, prescription transaction volumes showed solid improvement in the quarter. The increased transaction volume drove higher demand for our Access programs, including our prior authorization products. During the quarter, we noted strong new brand prescription volumes, which included the GLP-1 drug category.\nThe strength of our program supporting access and affordability solutions positions us to capture the demand driven by the strong prescription utilization trends. Our products continue to receive positive feedback and recognition for the value that they deliver to our partners. One example of this is CoverMyMeds' electronic prior authorization solutions Historically, the prior authorization process was a tedious and time-consuming task for providers. Through the technology solutions that McKesson has, we automate this process, providing a faster and easier way to review, complete and track prior authorization requests.\nCoverMyMeds is delivering value and returns for our partners by increasing connectivity between pharmacies providers, payers and biopharma manufacturers through next-generation access affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. First quarter results exemplify the success of our broad range of technology programs and support services.\nIn Medical-Surgical Solutions, our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our core business demonstrated revenue and operating profit growth. Revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1% year-over-year. And operating profit was $235 million, a decrease of 12%. First quarter results were impacted by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and lower illness season testing, including flu and COVID-19 tests when compared to the prior year.\nAs a reminder, the first quarter of fiscal 2023 saw an extension of the 2022 illness season, driving higher levels of illness testing and related products. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7% driven by growth in the extended and primary care businesses, partially offset by a nonrecurring expense of $12 million.\nWithin the Primary Care market, we saw growth in lab solutions, equipment and specialty pharmaceuticals. In the Extended Care market, growth was led by sales to new customers, which included increased volumes of nutritional supplements. We are pleased with the continued solid results, which are in line with our expectations. Our leadership position, combined with operating execution positions us for continued growth across the ultimate sites of care.\nNext, let me address our International results. Revenues in the first quarter were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 47% year-over-year. And operating profit was $90 million, a decrease of 35%. On an FX-adjusted basis, first quarter revenues were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 44% and operating profit was $95 million, a decrease of 31%. First quarter results reflect the year-over-year effects from the combined divestitures within our European businesses.\nLet me wrap up our segment review. Corporate expenses were $149 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% year-over-year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Corporate expenses included the receipt of a payment relating to a prior tax receivable agreement in our previous joint venture with Change Healthcare. During the quarter, we had losses of $7 million or $0.04 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to losses of approximately $22 million or $0.11 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\nAs a reminder, the McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage, digital health and services companies. We're pleased with the insights and the results that we've obtained through this portfolio. The impacts on our consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment.\nTurning now to our cash position, balance sheet and capital deployment on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We made $124 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in new and existing distribution centers as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion.\nAnd as a reminder, our cash position or working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and therefore, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. We returned $770 million of cash to shareholders, which included $696 million of share repurchases and $74 million in dividend payments.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully completed a public offering for $1 billion of notes with 5- and 10-year tenors. And currently, we retired approximately $900 million of notes that were due March of 2024. These transactions reduced our interest expense, and they further support our strong credit profile as evidenced by our recent credit rating upgrades. Our Board of Directors approved 2 actions in July: first, a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.62 per share; and second, the Board approved an additional $6 billion of share repurchase authorization bringing the total remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $9 billion.\nThese actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board of Directors and management have in the execution of our strategic priorities. Now let me discuss our updated outlook. The guidance I'm providing today relates to fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis.\nI'll discuss the key items, beginning with additional details of our consolidated guidance, and a full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 and in our supplemental slide presentation. As we've talked about already today, we are encouraged by the strong performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. And as a result, we're increasing our earnings per diluted share outlook to a new range of $26.55 to $27.35.\nAs a result of this, we now anticipate earnings per diluted share to increase 13% to 16% when excluding certain items. As a reminder of what the certain items include, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024; a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023; and $1.90 related to COVID-19-related items in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments in fiscal 2023.\nAnd we anticipate the impact of COVID-19-related items to be immaterial to fiscal 2024. We anticipate operating profit will be flat to 4% decline compared to the prior year. When excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by 6% to 10% year-over-year. Let me discuss the outlook for our segments. Our core distribution business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment continues to demonstrate its strong value proposition to our customers.\nAnd we anticipate further growth in specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics business, where our customers can access an expansive portfolio of plasma-derived products, biologics, oncology treatments and other specialty drugs at competitive prices from a single source. During the first quarter, we experienced a revenue tailwind from higher volumes related to weight loss or GLP-1 drugs.\nOur full year outlook assumes that volumes related to GLP-1 drugs will remain elevated compared to the prior year and may vary quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate this class of drugs will continue to be a revenue tailwind for U.S. Pharmaceutical as we support our customers through our distribution services. As I discussed earlier, these drugs have a lower distribution margin rate profile.\nFor the full year, we now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 13% to 15% and operating profit to increase 3% to 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 8% to 11%. The full year performance includes continued investment in our oncology platform and increased technology spend to support the growth of the segment.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13% and operating profit growth of 15% to 19%, which reflects increased utilization and new brand prescription transaction volumes, including the GLP-1 drugs and strong demand for the Access, adherence and affordability products and programs that we offer. We anticipate that we may continue to see quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment driven by transaction volumes, the pace and trajectory of new product drug launches and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nIn the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 1% decline to 3% growth and operating profit to decrease 5% to 11%. For the full year, we anticipate volumes of COVID-19 tests to continue to decline compared to fiscal 2023 and the impact from the COVID-19-related items will remain immaterial to fiscal 2024 results.\nExcluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 15% year-over-year. And finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from European businesses and transactions that we closed during fiscal 2023.\nAs I've previously discussed, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Venture equity investments recorded in the first quarter as well as elevated technology spend to support the growth of our businesses.\nNow moving below the line. As a result of the debt transactions that I discussed earlier in my remarks, we anticipate lower interest expense in the range of $205 million to $225 million. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expense.\nOur outlook incorporates plans repurchased approximately $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $133 million to $134 million. Our portfolio continues to generate strong free cash flow. We remain committed to operating profit growth and efficient capital deployment, and our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation.\nIn summary, our strong start to fiscal 2024 and our outlook for the remainder of the year results in an increase to adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $26.55 to $27.35. Excluding the impact of certain items and the contribution from our European operations, we anticipate earnings per diluted share growth of 16% to 20% in fiscal 2024.\nOur outlook further demonstrates the shareholder value creation framework that we have discussed previously. We continue to be focused on sustainable growth and efficient deployment of capital. We're pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year. Our 50,000 Team McKesson associates continue to deliver exceptional performance.\nOur first quarter financial performance reflects their dedication as well as the strength of our portfolio. Through our expansive oncology and biopharma platforms, we're supporting customers and patients by advancing health outcomes for all. We're delivering faster time to therapy for patients, and we're accelerating the discovery, development and manufacturing of new therapies.\nOur services and solutions are at the forefront of improving patient outcomes and ensuring more patients have access to quality care. With our strong underlying momentum from the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and our aligned focus on our growth strategies, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for your questions."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Nicole Kramer, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our call today. Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter results, closing out a very successful fiscal 2023. We delivered full year revenues of $277 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $25.94.\nWhen excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 15% from the prior year, driven by momentum across all business segments. In fiscal 2023, Team McKesson made significant progress executing our company priorities and advancing our position as a diversified health care services company. We grew our biopharma and oncology platforms through a balance of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and internal investments. We delivered growth in the core distribution businesses and we divested the majority of the operations in Europe, furthering our goal to streamline and optimize the portfolio.\nAs we close out fiscal 2023 and look ahead, we're confident in our ability to carry the business momentum forward, and we're excited to update and increase our long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets. This is a testament to our strategic focus, consistent execution and confidence in the outlook of the business. Building off our differentiated assets and capabilities, we're well positioned to deliver strong sustainable growth in the years ahead. Brett will later walk you through more of the financial details, including fiscal 2024 outlook and the updated long-term growth segment targets.\nI wanted to start my remarks today, though, with the foundation of all of our strategies, which is our focus on people and culture. Our talent is critical to everything that we do at McKesson. We strive to be the best place to work in health care, and we're building a culture that not only unites the team, but empowers them to innovate and succeed. One of the important commitments we have to our employees is to create a workspace where everyone can be comfortable to work at their very best.\nIn the past quarter, at McKesson, we celebrated Black History Month in February and Women's History Month in March with many great, great employee-led events. I had the opportunity to participate in many of these, and I'm energized by the dedication and passion our employees have demonstrated towards promoting awareness and listening and supporting each other as Team McKesson. We have a strong employee value proposition, and our progress in creating the best place to work is being recognized externally.\nRecently, we were pleased to be named by Forbes as one of America's Best Large Employers, earning the third highest ranking in health care. We were also named by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places for Work for Women among many, many more recognitions. I'm very proud of the accomplishments, togetherness and the alignment of our team.\nOur second company priority is to drive sustainable core growth. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, the core Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to support the growth momentum of the segment. In fiscal 2023, the segment revenue increased 13% and adjusted operating profit, excluding COVID-19-related contributions, increased 8%, representing the highest profit growth rate since we formed this segment.\nWe renewed our long-standing relationship with CVS and delivered strong value propositions to support customers across all channels, partnering with them to help solve their most immediate business needs. Our ability to consistently deliver high-quality services is supported by our deep expertise in pharmaceutical distribution and scaled network of assets. We continue to invest in the infrastructure to improve efficiency and modernize the network in support of our growth and in pursuit of efficiencies.\nIn October 2022, we opened a new state-of-the-art pharmaceutical distribution center in Ohio. This is one of our most technologically advanced facilities. It leverages automation to increase efficiency, increase productivity and enhance the employee experience. Leveraging our scale distribution network and logistics expertise, we have supported the U.S. government and its initiative of distributing COVID-19 vaccine and the kitting and storage of ancillary kits. Both government contracts are scheduled to expire in July of 2023.\nLooking back at the past 2 years, Team McKesson has demonstrated incredible agility, dedication and commitment in standing up the operation and in distributing millions of life-saving vaccines across the country. We've gained invaluable experience, deepened our relationship with government partners and proven our value, capabilities and expertise.\nThe next priority I want to talk about is our priority to expand the oncology and biopharma platforms through years of focused investment and execution, we have built differentiated assets and capabilities in oncology and in biopharma services, and we've strengthened our market positions in these high-growth and high-margin areas.\nI'll start with the oncology platform. One of the pillars of our oncology platform is the distribution capability. We are the leading distributor in the community oncology market with a scaled reach to providers in the community setting. Biologics, our specialty pharmacy, supports more than 3,500 specialty practices with cancer and other rare disease medications. Through our GPO services, on [ Mark ] and Unity, we serve thousands of oncology physicians and delivered significant savings on oncology drug purchases for practices, both within the U.S. oncology network and other community-based practices.\nFiscal 2023 has been a year of significant growth for our practice management business. The U.S. Oncology Network welcomed 3 new practices, Epic Care, Nexus Health and most recently, the Regional Cancer Care Associates as effective as of April 1, 2023. With these additions, the number of providers grew by more than 450 to a total exceeding over 2,300. This represents the fastest growth period since we acquired the U.S. Oncology Network in 2010. These new practices expand the reach of the network into new geographies and enhance its commitment to providing high-quality care close to home. In addition to the expansion in footprint, we continue to empower the growth of individual oncology practices to ensure that they are the forefront of cancer care. Physicians in the network stand out as thought leaders in the industry with participation in leading publications and leadership roles within the industry.\nThe network also plays a leading role in the transformation to value-based care, including its participation in the oncology care model. In October 2022, U.S. Oncology Research formed a joint venture with HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute, creating a fully integrated oncology research organization. We expect this transaction to accelerate our oncology strategy, expand clinical research and increase access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and, more importantly, for patients.\nWe're pleased with the performance across the oncology platform, and we believe our differentiated set of assets allows us to be a key partner of choice across both providers and biopharma companies. In addition to the momentum in the oncology platform, we're also making significant progress in growing our assets and capabilities in the biopharma platform. We continue to enhance the way patients get their medications by improving access, affordability and adherence to prescription medications.\nIn this past year, we managed programs that help patients save more than $8 billion on branded and specialty medications and prevented approximately 9.9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges. This helped patients get access to medicine more than 78 million times. In November of 2022, we completed the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company. The acquisition expands our affordability and adherence capabilities and sets the foundation for the expansion of outcomes management and evidence-based biopharma and payer services.\nFor the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest quarter of the year, driven by customer annual verification activities. Our employees had a particularly busy season this past quarter, assisting the highest volume of pace in the history of the segment. We continue to see strong market demand for the products and services we provide, which supports the growth outlook of this segment.\nWhile we're committed to grow the biopharma platform, we're also continually looking for opportunities to optimize the portfolio of products and services we offer. We have a disciplined review process to ensure that our resources are aligned with the areas of most strategic priorities. In this past quarter, we made the decision to reprioritize investments of products within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, that we believe have reached the end of their life cycle and are no longer essential to the growth strategy.\nThese actions will allow us to improve operational efficiency and more importantly, to better focus investments in other strategic areas and to maximize our resources for growth opportunities. These types of decisions are always difficult, and it had a direct impact on some of our employees. I am deeply grateful for the contributions of all our Prescription Technology Solutions employees have made that have led to the significant growth in this segment for the past several years. As part of this initiative, we're also streamlining the real estate assets supporting more flexibility for our employees. We remain confident about our differentiated capabilities, the market opportunity and our ability to achieve the long-term growth targets of this segment.\nAnother important portfolio action we are executing is the divestiture of our European businesses. We have now successfully divested businesses in 11 of the 12 countries with Norway being the only country for which we are still exploring alternatives.\nAs we make significant progress in expanding the strategic growth areas, we are doing so in a way that allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. We're committed to drive sustainability and to execute on initiatives that are aligned to our business strategy, support our growth and contribute to measurable and enduring positive impacts and health outcomes for our stakeholders and communities. We look forward to publishing our impact report in June to share our progress on these important initiatives.\nEarlier this year, our near-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were approved by the science-based targets initiative, focused on energy, transportation and real estate, our teams are taking meaningful actions to achieve these targets and improve the business. Recently, we were included in Sustainalytics 2023 industry top-rated ESG companies list, recognizing our comprehensive commitment and achievements in environmental, social and governance-related issues.\nSo let me pull everything together. McKesson reported a strong fourth quarter and full year results. Looking back to fiscal 2023, we made significant progress in advancing our company priorities. We executed on our strategy with focus and dedication. We invested in our businesses and our people for future growth. And as a diversified health care services company, we enacted positive changes to our customers, partners and their patients. I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved as a team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue the momentum and deliver sustainable growth as reflected in our updated long-term segment growth targets.\nWith that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you for additional comments.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, McKesson Corp.\n\nWell, thank you, Brian. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 results, and then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2024 outlook, including our updated long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets. My comments today will refer to our fiscal 2023 adjusted results unless I state otherwise.\nWe delivered strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per diluted share was $7.19, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. These results were right in line with the guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call. Our results demonstrate the breadth of McKesson's strength as a leading diversified health care services company with strong performance and growth in each of our core operating businesses.\nFor the full year, earnings per diluted share increased 9% year-over-year to $25.94 driven by a lower share count in growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower contributions in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses.\nFull year earnings per diluted share also included $2.36 related to the following certain items, which can also be found on Slide 23 in the appendix to our earnings presentation. $0.78 related to the U.S. government centralized COVID-19 vaccine distribution program, $1.12 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. $0.65 related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare. And $0.19 related to net losses associated with McKesson ventures equity investments.\nExcluding these certain items, earnings per diluted share increased 15% year-over-year, above our previously communicated long-term growth rate target. Our strong full year results are broad-based and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.\nBefore I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our fourth quarter GAAP-only results. We remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. In support of delivering sustainable value, innovation and growth, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced a broad set of initiatives to simplify our infrastructure, drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization. These initiatives include headcount reductions and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we recorded charges of $60 million related to these initiatives, which include severance and other employee-related costs within our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, including certain asset impairments primarily within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and real estate charges within corporate. We anticipate total charges of approximately $125 million within our Prescription Technology Solutions in U.S. Pharmaceutical segments as well as corporate to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024.\nMoving now to our consolidated results. Our consolidated revenues increased 4% to $68.9 billion in the fourth quarter and for the full year, increased 5% to $276.7 billion. Fourth quarter and full year results were driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including increased specialty product volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Excluding the impact of the European business operations, including these completed divestitures and PAUSE revenues increased 13% in the fourth quarter and 12% in the full year when compared to fiscal 2022.\nGross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 8%. For the full year, gross profit was $12.2 billion, a decrease of 7%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the full year, primarily as a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.\nOperating expenses decreased 14% in the quarter and 13% for the full year, largely driven by completed European divestitures in our international segment and lower opioid litigation costs. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 8% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 4% to $1.3 billion, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including solid contributions from our generics program and Prescription Technology Solutions growth more than offsetting the impact from completed divestitures in the International segment.\nFull year operating profit increased 3% to $5 billion, primarily led by growth in our North American businesses, partially offset by these completed divestitures in our international segment, and lower contributions from COVID-19-related items year-over-year. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19-related products, a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the TRA with Change Healthcare in the third quarter and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, operating profit increased 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year when compared to fiscal 2022.\nMoving below the line, interest expense was $7 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. The increase was primarily due to impacts from higher interest rates. Effective tax rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 18.8% for the full year, in line with our original guidance. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items.\nWrapping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $138 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year.\nTurning to our fourth quarter and full year segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business is a scale efficient business and comprises a breadth and depth of services and capabilities, including our growing oncology platform, and we're pleased with the momentum in this segment.\nFourth quarter revenues were $61.7 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year driven by growth across all customer segments, including increased volume of specialty products, higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, which is partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 10% to $861 million and for the full year, increased 6% to $3.1 billion, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program.\nWe remain pleased with the performance of our generics program, led by stable market fundamentals and the strength of our sourcing operations. We continue to provide solid value to our customers and partners, delivering low cost and stable supply.\nOur contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided an operating profit benefit of approximately $21 million or $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $12 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, this contract provided a benefit of $149 million or $0.78 per share compared to $186 million or $0.89 per share in fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year compared to fiscal 2022 results which were ahead of the segment's long-term growth target.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year driven by growth in prescription volumes in our third-party logistics business and access and adherent solutions transaction volumes. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 35% to $218 million and full year operating profit increased 15% to $679 million, driven by growth in access and affordability solutions. Fourth quarter results were also positively impacted by annual customer verification support activities as well as increased volume growth, partially due to the commercial success of the brands we serve.\nThrough our comprehensive suite of solutions and services, McKesson helped patients access their medicine over 24 million times in the fourth quarter, the highest number of patients assisted in the segment's history. The segment produced strong fourth quarter results and full year performance was in line with our original guidance.\nMoving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year and operating profit was $248 million, a decrease of 17%. For the full year, operating profit declined 4% to $1.2 billion. Fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 program, partially offset by growth in the primary care business, including favorable sourcing activities and illness season testing compared to the prior year.\nContribution for COVID-19 tests in our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of $31 million or $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $85 million or $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the full year, COVID-19 related items provided a benefit of $216 million or $1.12 per share compared to $371 million or $1.78 per share in fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year compared to fiscal 2022 results, which was at the upper end of the original guidance range that we provided.\nNext, let me address our international results. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $3.4 billion, a decrease of 61% year-over-year, and operating profit was $80 million, a decrease of 46%. On an FX-adjusted basis, fourth quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 58% and operating profit was $88 million, a decrease of 40%. For the full year operating profit, on an FX adjusted basis, decreased by 22%. Fourth quarter and full year results reflect the year-over-year effects in the completed divestitures within our European businesses.\nIn wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $149 million in the quarter, a decrease of 19% year-over-year. For the full year, corporate expenses were $457 million, a decrease of 21%, which included a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare in the third quarter.\nCorporate expenses in the fourth quarter and full year were positively impacted by lower opioid-related expenses compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we had net losses of $12 million or $0.06 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to net losses of approximately $6 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the full year, McKesson had net losses related to equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio of approximately $36 million or $0.19 per share. This compares to net gains of approximately $98 million or $0.47 per share for the full year fiscal 2022.\nAs a reminder, McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies, and we're pleased with the insights and the results we have obtained through this portfolio. The impacts on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the TRA and net gains and losses within the McKesson Ventures portfolio, corporate expenses decreased 23% and 19% in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.\nTurning now to our cash position and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 13. For the fiscal year, we generated record cash flow, reflecting the broad-based strength of our businesses, the focus on working capital efficiency and disciplined capital investment. For the full year, we generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, including $558 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments in our distribution centers. We used our strong balance sheet to return $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, including $138 million in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we entered a new share repurchase program, which allows up to $1 billion of new repurchases. I'll speak about our share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2024 in a few minutes. Additionally, we paid dividends of $292 million for the full year, and we remain committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings growth.\nWhen combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 85% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2023. We continue to utilize capital deployment as a method to drive value for our shareholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we returned $12.9 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $11.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total shares outstanding by approximately 33%.\nOur strong operating performance, combined with our return of capital to shareholders, reinforces our commitment to driving shareholder value.\nNow let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items, beginning with additional details of fiscal '24 consolidated guidance. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 14 through 19 and in our supplemental slide presentation.\nFiscal '23 was a strong year where we exceeded our full year operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow guidance that we laid out at the beginning of May last year. These results have increased our confidence and our outlook. Strategies that we've discussed today are delivering, and we expect that they will continue to deliver strong levels of operating profit, earnings per share growth and robust cash flow generation.\nWe anticipate earnings per diluted share of $26.10 to $26.90 for fiscal '24, which contemplates operating profit growth across each of our core operating businesses when excluding COVID-19-related items supplemented by disciplined capital deployment. We anticipate earnings per diluted share to increase 11% to 14% in fiscal '24 when excluding $1.90 related to COVID-19 related items, $0.19 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the TRA with Change Health care in fiscal 2023.\nLet me start by discussing our approach to COVID-19-related items in our fiscal '24 outlook. Since the onset of the pandemic, McKesson has played a central role in providing support for the U.S. government for distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies as well as providing the distribution of COVID-19 tests to our customers. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024 and the scheduled completion of our COVID-19 contracts with the U.S. government in July of 2023, we anticipate that the impact from COVID-19-related items, including COVID-19 tests, will be immaterial to fiscal '24 results. As such, we will no longer provide earnings per diluted share guidance metrics specific to these items going forward.\nLet me discuss the outlook for our segments. We continue to be pleased with the growth we're seeing in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The value proposition of our core distribution platform resonates across retail, health systems and provider settings, and we anticipate growth across several customer channels. We also anticipate further growth in our oncology platform, U.S. Oncology Network, the largest oncology practice management organization in the U.S. has continued to expand its footprint into local communities to increase the availability of advanced care and better patient outcomes. We continue to grow the provider footprint with over 2,300 providers in the network.\nWe formed a joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute in fiscal 2023. This partnership enhances our proposition to biopharma companies and further advances our differentiated offerings across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle. Additionally, in fiscal '24, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical price increases to be in line with increases experienced in fiscal 2022. We do not anticipate the higher price increases that we saw in fiscal '23 to repeat in fiscal '24.\nWithin our generics business, the fundamentals remain competitive, yet stable with our strong sourcing program continuing to provide value for our customers. Wrapping up the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, for fiscal '24, we anticipate revenue to increase 9% to 11% and operating profit to be approximately flat to 3% growth year-over-year. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution from fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 5% to 8%.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13% and operating profit growth of 11% to 15%, reflecting continued organic growth and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions and services. Within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our 3PL services typically represent slightly more than half of full year revenues. While services represented less than 10% of full year operating profit on average over the previous 3 fiscal years.\nWe have stated previously, the mix of revenue in this segment can vary quarter-to-quarter. However, over the balance of a full year, we anticipate your product mix in fiscal '24 to be consistent with prior years. In fiscal '23, we also acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. We're pleased with this acquisition's progress and will continue its integration during fiscal '24 as we begin to realize the value from the synergies. This segment continues to perform well with higher revenue and margin opportunities that leverage our scale and technology capabilities. The strong growth profile over the last few years reflects our ongoing strategic investments to grow and expand our suite of products and solutions to provide next-generation patient access affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated provider workflows.\nIn the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to be approximately a 1% decline to 3% growth and operating profit to decrease 5% to 11%. Medical Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services throughout the alternate site market, including growth in the primary care business and lab solutions. Our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies ends in July of 2023, and we expect the remaining impact of this contract to be immaterial to fiscal '24 results.\nAnd while we anticipate a modest contribution from COVID-19 tests, we anticipate volumes to continue to decline and be at a lower level compared to fiscal '23 and immaterial to fiscal '24 results. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19-related items from fiscal '23 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 15% year-over-year.\nFinally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to date and that we expect to close during fiscal '24. We continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit our remaining operations in Norway, and as I mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset any dilution resulting from the European divestitures.\nNow turning to cash flow and capital deployment. Our North American businesses continue to generate strong free cash flow, and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. We will continue to prioritize growth through organic opportunities, however, increasingly, through acquisitions that are on strategy and appropriate multiples.\nFor fiscal '24, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares in fiscal '24. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal '24 to be in the range of approximately $133 million to $134 million.\nCombining all these elements leads to adjusted earnings per share of $26.10 to $26.90. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items and the contribution from our remaining European operations in Norway, we anticipate earnings per diluted share growth of approximately 14% to 18% in fiscal '24, which is above the long-term target rate we previously provided. The strong outlook further demonstrates our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital.\nTurning now to our long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets, which can be found on Slide 19. As COVID-19-related contracts with U.S. government are scheduled to end in July of 2023, and the contribution from Europe continues to run off as guided, we remain committed to executing against our strategic initiatives and building on our differentiated assets and capabilities. As a result, we're pleased to be raising our long-term growth targets. The demonstration of the execution of our strategies, our leading market positions and strong financial position. For U.S. Pharmaceutical, we anticipate 5% to 7% long-term growth, which is up from 4%. The Prescription Technology Solutions, 11% to 12% long-term growth, up from 11% and in Medical Surgical Solutions, 10% to 12% long-term growth, up from 10%.\nWith our strong underlying momentum and our aligned focus on the many growth opportunities moving forward, I remain confident we'll continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth and provide superior value for our customers, team members and shareholders alike.\nIn conclusion, we are well positioned in the market with a unique strength PAUSE scale that only McKesson can provide. We will continue to invest in our strategies as we expand the reach of our oncology ecosystem and biopharma services platform. As fiscal 2023 demonstrated, our strategies are working, producing value for all stakeholders. We have tremendous momentum across the business, a strong financial outlook and our financial framework and execution position us to deliver sustainable profit growth, cash flows and shareholder value creation.\nWe have great confidence in our teams and our products and services and in our strategy. With that, let me now turn it back over to the operator for your questions."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVP of IR, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nCEO & Director, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call this afternoon. Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2023 results, another quarter with solid adjusted operating profit growth, underscoring the significant progress we continue to make in our company in terms of our overall company priorities. It also signals the continued strength and stability of our North American businesses.\nAs a result of our third quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $24.45 to $24.95 to an updated range of $25.75 to $26.15. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our 4 strategic priorities. Then I'll ask Britt to provide additional details on the financial performance in our third quarter.\nAs you know, a few years ago, we crafted our enterprise strategy, and we shared our priorities with our stakeholders. We are evolving our portfolio of capabilities, and we have divested businesses that are not aligned with our strategy. And we have invested both organically and through acquisitions to add to our differentiated capabilities. We're increasing our focus on the areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy.\nOur progress to date is underpinned by the execution against these important company priorities: a focus on people and culture; intentional efforts to evolve and grow our portfolio of capabilities; to advance and expand our differentiated oncology ecosystem and our biopharma services platform; and our commitment towards sustainable core growth. The strength of our core distribution businesses continued to show solid growth and generate free cash flow, which provides us a strong balance sheet and the ability to invest internally and externally into the business.\nI'll start with our first priority, our focus on people and culture. Embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all. McKesson is an impact-driven organization. We recognize that giving back to the community is important to our associates, and we continue to provide engaging and, most importantly, impactful ways for Team McKesson to do exactly that.\nIn the third quarter, we had another successful Community Impact Day, where nearly 13,000 members of Team McKesson across North America volunteered to support nonprofits that provide food to people facing hunger.\nMcKesson also held its annual Giving Tuesday, where Team McKesson's generosity resulted in $1.5 million in employee donations, with a portion of that matched by the McKesson Foundation, which will ultimately be distributed to 1,500 local, national and global charities.\nIn addition to the progress made by our employees, the McKesson Foundation donated more than $4 million to pharmacy schools to help increase workforce diversity and improve overall health outcomes for vulnerable populations. These grants, which range from 1 to 5 years in duration, will support various pharmacy school education and community outreach programs.\nThe innovative student support, professional development and community outreach that the McKesson Foundation is funding through these pharmacy school partnerships will help transform patient-pharmacist interactions, which we believe will lead to improved health equity and patient outcomes for vulnerable populations in their respective areas. I'm proud of our talented team as their dedication, hard work and innovation enables our business to positively impact our partners, our customers and our communities.\nOur next priority is to evolve and grow the portfolio. We have continued to evolve and grow our capabilities, ensuring that our capital deployment is tightly aligned with where we have the best growth opportunities. This led us to our decision to exit the European region as well as a handful of smaller businesses over the last several years. We're progressing on our plans to exit the European region and have successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries we operated in.\nWe remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our business in Norway, which is the only country we have not yet divested. These actions allow us to focus our resources on areas that support our long-term strategy. It's provided us additional flexibility to invest internally or to look externally to expand our oncology and our biopharma ecosystems, which aligns well with our next company priority.\nWe have made meaningful progress expanding our oncology and biopharma ecosystems as exemplified by the strategic investments made year-to-date. McKesson recently announced that The US Oncology Network, the U.S.'s largest oncology practice management organization, has continued to expand its geographic footprint with the addition of 2 new practices, Epic Care in California and Nexus Health in New Mexico. Both are now part of The US Oncology Network as of January 1, 2023.\nThese practices offer a wide range of specialties, enabling more comprehensive care that helps ensure patients can conveniently receive the care they need in their local communities during their entire treatment and healing journey. And we're excited by the new opportunities that our joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute, as well as the acquisition of Genospace, bring to our overall oncology ecosystem.\nI'm pleased with the substantial progress we've made in the development and expansion of our oncology ecosystem. This progress supports the solid performance of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as we further our long-term growth strategies. We will continue to evaluate internal and external opportunities to invest, to grow and to evolve this business.\nIn addition to our oncology assets and capabilities, our biopharma services platform remains another priority area of growth. Over the last several years, we've systematically built and acquired an ecosystem of assets that complement each other and are more valuable together than as separate stand-alone solutions. Together, these assets leverage our network reach, technology and clinical expertise to enable better access and affordability of medications, which ultimately improves patient outcomes and impacts real lives.\nWe started building this business in 2006 with the acquisition of RelayHealth, which gave us connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies. We've been able to integrate value-added services right into the workflow so that we can help their processes be more seamless and give the customer the experience they need and deserve.\nWe then acquired CoverMyMeds, a long-term partner of McKesson in 2017. This expanded our network by providing connectivity with over 750,000 providers. The integration of CoverMyMeds' automation solution alleviates some of the friction out of the workflow providers, improving overall access for the patient. RxCrossroads brought us scale in the business that we already had, a hub services and patient support program, and they expanded our clinical expertise across many new therapeutic areas.\nIn 2020, recall, we brought these businesses together as prescription technology solutions so we can migrate from providing individual offerings to a more comprehensive end-to-end suite of solutions. This enabled us to enhance our value proposition and to help find and get patients started on appropriate therapy more quickly.\nMost recently, we acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. It's more than just price transparency, it really gives members insight and actionable guidance that can drive savings and improve health outcomes for patients.\nSo by bringing these businesses together, Relay, CoverMyMeds, RxCrossroads, Rx Savings Solutions, our McKesson prescription technology solutions connects pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma manufacturers for really next-generation patient access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows.\nCoverMyMeds now processes approximately 21 billion pharmacy transactions annually on behalf of patients to support medication access and affordability. We continue to build and invest in innovative products that allow McKesson to provide unique insights and capabilities to our customers. And these investment dollars are reflected in our results in the segment year-to-date as well as in our fiscal 2023 outlook.\nDuring the third quarter, we continued to organically invest in this segment as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. The investments have enabled us to expand the network and connectivity, develop new solutions and meet the growing demands of our customers.\nWhile we continue to invest and grow the platform, we're also always assessing opportunities to evolve and streamline the portfolio to ensure our resources and investments are focused on the products that bring the most value to patients. This business saw substantial momentum coming out of COVID-19 pandemic as our biopharma manufacturers continued to bring more brands to our platform and prescription utilization trends continued to improve.\nThese factors led to strong adjusted operating profit growth in this segment in recent fiscal years. We remain confident in the overall trajectory in this segment and our financial target of 11% growth, and we will continue to reinvest profit into this business to accelerate this business over the long term. The investments made in our oncology and biopharma ecosystems have been possible, largely due to the long-standing growth in our sustainable core distribution businesses, which are our fourth company priority.\nAs we exit the European region, we've been able to focus our efforts on our North American businesses. Our teams are continuously evaluating how to drive efficiencies in our core operations. Whether that's leveraging a more modernized platform, it allows us to act with more speed and agility or ensuring we have the optimal talent and resources to help these businesses succeed.\nThe fundamentals of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains strong. The work that Team McKesson has done to streamline process and efficiencies, combined with positive prescription volume and patient utilization trends, reinforces our confidence in our long-term growth targets for our North American distribution businesses.\nIn the U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I'm excited to announce that our contract to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027 has been finalized. Our long-standing partnership with CVS further exemplifies the value of our scaled distribution capabilities.\nThe performance of the core operations in our North American distribution business enables strong cash flow generation that's allowed McKesson to continue to innovate and become a leading diversified health care services company. We believe we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities to focus on our people and culture, to grow and evolve the business, to invest in our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem, underpinned by the sustainable core growth in our distribution businesses.\nLet me shift gears just a bit. McKesson has also made progress recently to address environmental sustainability. In January, McKesson received approval by the Science Based Targets initiative for its near-term climate change targets that contribute to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Our SBTi target serves as another example of our commitment to sustainability and our response to climate change.\nWe look forward to leveraging the advancements in climate-related technologies that will address these environmental challenges while also enhancing our business and helping to fulfill our company purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. We will, of course, continue to provide updates on our progress to stakeholders on these targets as well as our ongoing ESG-related initiatives on future calls.\nAs an organization, we're also committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. McKesson was recently recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023. We're quite honored that Newsweek recognizes McKesson's ongoing efforts to be a more diverse and inclusive employer.\nAll right, let me wrap things up. We are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter as we delivered on our growth strategy and as a diversified health care services company. McKesson's talented employees continue to demonstrate exceptional performance, and our third quarter results reflect their dedication and our execution together as a team in a dynamic operating environment. It also highlights the resiliency of our portfolio of businesses and solutions.\nThank you all for your time. With that, Britt, I'm going to toss it over to you for additional comments on the financial results.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McKesson Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our solid fiscal third quarter financial results reflect continued strong execution and momentum, advancing our company priorities. In the fiscal third quarter, we delivered solid growth across our North American segment, led by strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments.\nAnd we continue to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused and strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our solid financial performance and confidence in the underlying business, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $25.75 to $26.15.\nBefore I provide more details on our third quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP adjusted results, I want to point out 2 items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. First, we received proceeds of $129 million related to our share of an antitrust class action settlement. We recognized the gain within cost of sales in the third quarter. And second, we recognized a pretax gain of $97 million from the termination of fixed interest rate swaps. This gain is included under other income in the third quarter.\nLet's move now to a review of our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted results on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated revenues of $70.5 billion increased 3%, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased specialty product volumes, including retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 11%.\nGross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 10%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7%, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 14%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9%.\nOperating profit was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of a tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare and due to growth across North American businesses led by the strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. As a reminder, McKesson was a party to a TRA entered as part of the formation of the joint venture with Change Healthcare.\nUnder the terms of the TRA, Change was generally required to pay McKesson a portion of net tax savings resulting from amortization by the joint venture. In October of 2022, Change exercised its right to terminate the agreement and paid McKesson $126 million. Consistent with our prior practice recognizing similar items, this benefit is reflected in other income in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results in the quarter.\nMoving below the line, interest expense increased to $69 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates and unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region. And the effective tax rate was 23.4% for the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%.\nWrapping up our consolidated results. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was approximately 141 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchase activity. Overall, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.90, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6%.\nMoving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $61.9 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, branded pharmaceutical price increases and strength in oncology, which included increased patient visits, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit increased 6% to $778 million.\nOur contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.26 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, contributions from our generics programs, and improvements in pharmaceutical prescription volumes and oncology visits.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, faster growth in our third-party logistics business and higher technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 7% to $155 million, driven by growth in access, affordability and adherence solutions, partially offset by continued organic investments as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth.\nNext, moving on to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion, a decrease of 3%. Lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program partially offset the growth in the Primary Care business. Operating profit increased 2% to $336 million.\nThe contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.38 per share in the quarter as compared to $0.57 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 25%, driven by growth in the Primary Care business and favorable sourcing activities, which partially offset lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program.\nNext, let me address our international results. revenues were $4.4 billion and operating profit was $143 million, a decrease of 36%. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 48%, and operating profit was $158 million, a decrease of 29%. Third quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestiture of the European businesses.\nMoving next to corporate. Corporate expenses were $19 million, a decrease of 88% year-over-year, driven by the early termination of a tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, corporate expenses decreased 9%. Additionally, we incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million.\nTurning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we made $376 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in distribution center capacity, automation and regulatory enhancements and investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems.\nFor the first 9 months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. During the quarter, we allocated $833 million towards M&A activities, including a joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions. We also returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $2 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $3.5 billion of share repurchases and $216 million in dividend payments. At the end of our fiscal third quarter, we had $3.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.\nLet me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our revised guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 2% to 6% operating profit growth as compared to fiscal 2022.\nOur guidance includes $2.30 to $2.50 of contribution attributable to the following 4 items: $0.70 to $0.80 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment; approximately $0.15 related to year-to-date net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments; and a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare. As a reminder, our contracts with the U.S. government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies extends through July of 2023.\nWe anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $435 million to $475 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, which we recorded in the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year; and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, which was recognized in the third quarter. As a reminder, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures' portfolio estimates in our guidance.\nWhen excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, we anticipate operating profit to increase 7% to 11%, above the previous operating profit growth target.\nMoving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects the higher interest rate environment. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%, 20% remains unchanged. Based on our third quarter results and our outlook for the fiscal year, we're increasing and narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $25.75 to $26.15 from the previous range of $24.45 to $24.95.\nWhen excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures' equity investments for both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the fiscal 2022 benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance indicates approximately 13% to 16% growth over the prior year.\nMoving now to the segment outlook for fiscal 2023. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 5% to 8%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.70 to $0.80 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government.\nWhen excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 7% to 9% operating profit growth. We are pleased with the momentum of the segment. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to deliver stable growth through focused execution and operational excellence. Let me highlight a few of the factors that are leading to the strong segment performance.\nFirst, we've observed stable prescription utilization growth, which underpins the momentum in our health system and retail offerings. Second, we maintain a favorable outlook for our oncology platform, which we see delivering higher growth and higher margin contributions. We continue to execute and invest against our oncology strategy. And as Brian touched on earlier, we continue to add practices and providers to our scale and growing US Oncology network, and we are well positioned to capture increased oncology volumes.\nThird, we have a scaled an efficient generic sourcing operation, delivering stability of supply and low-cost products for our customers and patients. And specific to fiscal 2023, through the month of January, we observed branded pharmaceutical pricing that was modestly above our expectations.\nWhile fiscal 2023 results benefit from this modest increase, I would make the following 2 comments: first, the impact from higher branded pharmaceutical pricing remains less material now than historically, as more than 95% of our manufactured contracts are now on a fixed fee-for-service arrangement; and second, we would not anticipate this modest benefit to repeat in future years.\nOur U.S. Pharmaceutical segment is well positioned and has exhibited strong performance, leading to the increased fiscal 2023 growth outlook. As a result of our execution and the factors that I just noted, we anticipate that this segment will now grow above the 4% earnings growth target rate that we previously provided, including at our 2021 Investor Day.\nThe products and services within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered differentiated access adherence and affordability products. We are pleased with the solid growth in both revenue and operating profit this quarter. Biopharma Services remain an important strategic growth and investment area for McKesson. We're confident this segment will exhibit faster growth and higher margin.\nWe remain confident in our differentiated assets and capabilities. We have unmatched scale across transactions, provider and retail connectivity and product breadth. Our commitment to this segment is evidenced by the investments that we have made. Over the past 3 years, on average, we've organically invested approximately $100 million a year into new and existing products and services. And the recent acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions will accelerate the breadth of capabilities we continue to build out.\nWe also anticipate further organic investments in new capabilities as well as more M&A. The internal investment pattern, the mix of technology products and third-party logistics services and the life cycle of the products we serve, including the timing of launches, have resulted in variability in performance quarter-to-quarter. As we continue to invest and grow the business, we anticipate that there could be charges to further integrate product portfolios and supporting infrastructure.\nWe anticipate delivering revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 14% to 17%, which is in line with the 14% to 20% initial guidance that we communicated on our May 2022 earnings call and above the operating profit growth target of 11% provided at our Investor Day event in 2021. We are well positioned for strong growth, and we're committed to the operating growth targets that we've previously communicated.\nIn the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 1% to 5% and operating profit to decrease 1% to 4%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 12% to 15%.\nFinally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 26% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions that we have closed to date.\nFor fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.90 to $0.95 per diluted share, primarily in the first 9 months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and the contribution resulting for held-for-sale accounting for the transaction with PHOENIX Group.\nLet me conclude our outlook with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. We continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows have also been impacted by European divestiture activities and other transactions.\nAs discussed last quarter, our free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. We remain committed to be good stewards of capital for our shareholders. We have and will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We strategically think about capital allocation in 3 broad categories.\nFirst, we prioritize growth by investing internally and through M&A. We are focused on accelerating our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These growth platforms have differentiated asset scale and network capabilities.\nNext, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of our framework is a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity, underpinned by the maintenance of an investment-grade credit rating.\nOur outlook continues to incorporate plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares, which has been largely completed by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 142 million.\nLet me take a moment and reflect on the fiscal 2023 outlook and our growth targets. At our 2021 Investor Day event, we shared with you a set of growth metrics that reflect our commitment to drive continued momentum across the business segments. Since then, we've executed on our strategy and delivered operating profit growth consistently at or above the targets that we communicated on a consolidated and on a segment level.\nSome of the business dynamics that we outlined previously have materialized as tailwinds and contributed to recent growth, including growth in prescription volume and patient mobility, our ability to grow through macroeconomic unpredictability and successful execution on a disciplined capital deployment strategy that focuses on growth and maximizing shareholder return.\nMore importantly, the solid performance is further demonstration of our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation.\nIn closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter. We continued to deliver solid operating results through focused execution and strategic investment. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our disciplined growth strategy and financial framework give us the confidence we will deliver on our operating profit growth targets. Thank you.\nAnd now with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nVP of IR, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also includes a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nCEO & Director, McKesson Corporation\n\nThanks, Rachel, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Today, McKesson reported another good quarter with total company revenues of $70.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.06. When excluding the contributions from COVID-19-related items and McKesson Ventures, our adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% from the prior year.\nAs a result of our second quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $23.95 to $24.65 to an updated range of $24.45 to $24.95. We're pleased with the financial performance through the first half of our fiscal 2023 driven by continued execution and momentum across the enterprise. Our core distribution businesses have performed well and shown great resilience in navigating the dynamic macro environment we're all operating in.\nWe continue to strengthen our competitive advantage in oncology and biopharma services through both internal investment and acquisition as evidenced by the recent Rx Savings Solutions acquisition and the Sarah Cannon joint venture with HCA. We have established a differentiated position to win in both oncology and biopharma services. And our defined growth strategy, combined with our company vision, is a powerful reflection of how McKesson has transformed into a diversified health care services company.\nToday, I'm going to focus my remarks on our strategy and highlight the significant progress we've been making across our 4 company priorities. Then I'm going to turn it over to Britt, who's going to go into more detail on the business performance in our second quarter.\nLet me start where I always start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. We firmly believe that having the best talent is essential to our ability to consistently execute and deliver strong operating results. We continue to invest in our people, which allows us to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market. It's important to us that our employees are provided with the support and flexibility they need to thrive both in work and in their personal lives.\nAround this time last year, we were really excited to announce a new wellness program at McKesson. We called it Your Day, Your Way. And we celebrated the second anniversary this past Friday. It was a great pleasure to give our employees a company-sponsored day-off to promote their mental, physical and emotional well-being.\nWe're also committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We have a culture where everyone can bring their true authentic selves to work. In October, I signed the CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion, joining a group of inspiring leaders on creating a more inclusive world. This is an important opportunity for McKesson to demonstrate our values and take actions that support our employees and our communities.\nOur commitment to diversity is also reflected in our Board. Nearly half of our Board of Directors are women and/or people of color. Recently, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, one of McKesson's independent directors, was presented with the Distinguished Alumna Award by the DirectWomen Organization, recognizing her contribution to diversity in the boardroom and excellence in Board service. We're grateful for Kathleen's leadership and her inspiration.\nOur second company priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core. Our business is built on a strong foundation of pharmaceutical and medical distribution assets and capabilities across North America. In the U.S., the steady performance of pharmaceutical distribution underpins the operating results of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. In the second quarter, segment revenues increased by 12% year-over-year with growth across multiple customer channels.\nWe continue to expand our reach and deliver unique value propositions to all customers. In July, we hosted our annual ideaShare conference that brought together more than 2,100 independent pharmacies. It was a great forum that encouraged knowledge sharing, collaboration and really deeper connections across our Health Mart pharmacies.\nMcKesson has a long history of supporting and investing in independent pharmacies who have and continue to play such an important role in the health of our communities. We're also proud of the work our retail pharmacy chain partners play in improving access to care. In September, we announced an agreement in principle to extend our relationship with CVS Health to distribute pharmaceuticals to mail-order specialty pharmacies, retail pharmacies and distribution centers. This agreement goes through June 2027. We have been partners with CVS for more than 20 years, and we're extremely pleased to further this long-standing relationship.\nIn addition to pharmaceutical distribution, we also have sustainable core distribution assets in the Medical-Surgical segment. In the second quarter, segment adjusted operating profit grew 7% when excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items. The solid performance is primarily driven by our scale and reach across the alternate site market.\nThrough years of intentional investment and expansion, the Medical-Surgical segment has established market-leading positions in the primary care and extended care markets. Following the needs of the patients, we're also expanding our services to other channels such as government, consumer and direct-to-home markets. We continue to build out one of the largest, most tenured sales forces in the industry. These seasoned sales professionals help foster trust and strategic relationships and bring us closer to our customers.\nAlso, I want to remind you that while we continue to execute on the European exit, our strategy for our Canadian operations remains unchanged. The Canadian business performed well in the second quarter. Aligning with the company's strategy, McKesson Canada is expanding its offering to higher-growth, higher-margin areas, including digital health solutions.\nOur third company priority is to streamline the portfolio, which includes our continued progress in exiting our business operations in Europe. Today, we announced the completion of the sale to the PHOENIX Group, which includes the operations in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia. We have now successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries in Europe. Norway remains the only country that's not been divested, but we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for this business.\nStreamlining the portfolio is an ongoing process at McKesson. It doesn't end with the European divestitures. It's really an ongoing practice for us to continually assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We have a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that the allocation of resources is optimized to generate shareholder return and support long-term growth for the company.\nWe're also focused on streamlining our businesses internally. We have and will continue to modernize technology, improve levels of automation and simplify business processes. Taking these actions allows our team to execute with more speed and focus and to make our operational processes less labor-intensive and more efficient to better serve our customers and their patients.\nBuilding on the foundation of pharmaceutical and medical distribution, let me now expand on our 2 growth -- strategic growth areas: the biopharma services and the oncology ecosystem. In the biopharma ecosystem, we have a portfolio of differentiated assets that focus on connecting key stakeholders throughout the patient's journey and reducing prescription hurdles around access, affordability and adherence.\nOn our last earnings call, we shared with you examples of the affordability solutions within our biopharma ecosystem. While these solutions can help make prescriptions more affordable for patients, McKesson also has a significant offering of adherence-specific capabilities. We have a powerful network of over 4,000 field-based nurses who help patients manage therapies at home. We also have capabilities for in-office provider education through groups of experienced field nurses. Our adherence services help patients navigate complex medical issues and increase adherence by more than 25%. Leveraging our scaled network and connection to the pharmacies, we continue to explore new solutions and opportunities in the adherence space.\nTo accelerate our growth in biopharma services, we've been assessing strategic opportunities through both internal and external investments. Today, we completed the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, which is a benefit insights company that reaches more than 17 million patients. McKesson, in fact, has been a customer of Rx Savings Solutions for more than a year. And as a result, we've seen significant improvements in medication affordability and adherence for our members or employees as well as significant savings at the enterprise level.\nRx Savings Solutions brings a unique portfolio of product and channel access that are complementary to our existing assets. We're excited to leverage our combined resources to create new capabilities around access, affordability and adherence as well as new outcome management programs for biopharma and payers.\nPrescription Technology Solutions segment has been delivering strong performance in the past year, and we continue to support the growth with investment in talent. We usually ramp up staffing to prepare for the anticipated support needed for annual customer programs. In the second quarter, the timing and cadence of hiring has led to a slight year-over-year decline in adjusted operating profit in this segment.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2023 and beyond, biopharma services remains a large and growing opportunity, and we're confident in our differentiated market position that will help us achieve the long-term growth target laid out for this segment.\nWe're also making good progress within our oncology ecosystem. On October 31, we completed the transaction that brings together McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute in a joint venture. The team is energized to work together on integrating the 2 businesses, and we're excited by this opportunity to advance the next generation of cancer care by increasing patient access to clinical trials in the community setting.\nAs part of the transaction, we also acquired Genospace, a leading innovator in precision medicine and clinical trial matching. It will power oncology data and analytics capabilities for the joint venture and bring enhanced solutions to our provider partners.\nAlso within the oncology ecosystem, Ontada, our data and insights business, continues to partner with biopharma companies to advance cancer research. It was recently announced that Ontada formed a new strategic alliance with BeiGene. Together, they will focus on accelerating the development of real-world evidence to improve community education as well as increase patient access to oncology medicines.\nThe oncology ecosystem is expanding and becoming an increasingly important driver for the growth of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Our leading market position in community oncology distribution allows us to capture the growing market opportunity driven by a strong pipeline in drug launches.\nThe U.S. Oncology Network serves approximately 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S., and we're pleased that the network continues to attract new physicians to expand its reach and impact. The combined effort and progress on our company priorities, our focus on people and culture, on driving sustainable core growth, on streamlining the portfolio and expanding the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems are the driving force in advancing our growth strategy and generating long-term value for our shareholders.\nAs I review our strategic priorities, I want to make sure I highlight an important part of our enterprise strategy, which is our continued commitment to sustainability and ESG initiatives. As an impact-driven organization, we're dedicated to bringing positive changes to our stakeholders and society. While many impactful projects are happening across the enterprise, our focus has included improving access to health care, advancing health equity and protecting our environment.\n2 years ago, we created our first-ever global impact organization, bringing all ESG initiatives under a single business function. We're also enhancing the governance structure to ensure visibility and accountability to these important initiatives. With consultation from an executive steering committee and direct oversight from our Board of Directors, our ESG initiatives are deeply intertwined with how we operate our business, foster our culture and define our strategy.\nBefore I hand it over to Britt, I wanted to make just a few comments on the macroeconomic trends in the general business environment. In the past quarter, we observed stable prescription volumes and patient utilization trends, which were in line with our expectations. While the general economic environment remains quite fluid, the demand for health care proves to be fairly resilient and largely [un-impacted]. And I would say this is similar to what we have observed in past economic cycles.\nWe continue to experience cost inflation and some supply chain disruption impacting different parts of our business in different ways. However, through dedicated and well-planned actions, we've been able to manage the impact of these macroeconomic factors. Through the first half of the fiscal year, the financial impact has not been material to McKesson. We continue to monitor the dynamic environment. At this time, we do not anticipate any incremental impact in addition to what has already been contemplated in our fiscal 2023 outlook.\nLet me pull it all together. McKesson reported a solid second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact from COVID-19-related items and European divestitures, we're pleased with the momentum in the underlying business. We've demonstrated our ability to execute for growth and strategic advancement while navigating a quite dynamic macroeconomic environment. We are confident about our market positions and growth trajectory heading into the second half of the fiscal year.\nOf course, this isn't possible without a talented team committed to working together in service of our partners and patients. I want to thank all the McKesson employees. Their dedication, their hard work, their innovation, their spirit of collaboration are truly transformative and enabling positive impact to our partners, customers and patients.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Britt for additional comments.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McKesson Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid financial results for our fiscal second quarter, which reflect operating execution and progress against our growth strategies. As a result of our fiscal second quarter operational and financial performance, combined with our strong financial position and outlook for continued execution in the second half, we are narrowing and increasing our full year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $24.45 to $24.95.\nLet me start with a few company updates before reviewing our second quarter results. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress refining and strengthening our portfolio. We completed several key transactions executing against our disciplined capital allocation framework.\nLet me begin with Europe. As Brian mentioned, on October 31, we completed the sale of certain European operations and other assets with the PHOENIX Group. We're pleased that we were able to close this transaction sooner than our original fiscal 2023 guidance. To date, we've successfully exited 11 of the 12 European countries that we operated in, and Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and we continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit Norway.\nOur European exit activities have created a focused portfolio, streamlined capital allocation, and it positions the company for growth in oncology and biopharma services.\nNext, I'm pleased to report on substantial progress with respect to our oncology and biopharma services growth strategies. Let me start with oncology. In June, we announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Research Institute, including the acquisition of Genospace, Sarah Cannon's personalized medicine platform.\nOn October 31, we closed the transaction and successfully formed the joint venture. McKesson has a 51% ownership interest and will consolidate the results of operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, beginning with our fiscal third quarter. This transaction further advances our oncology ecosystem, which contains a broad range of scaled and differentiated assets and capabilities. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate that this transaction will have an immaterial impact on our results. We expect the joint venture and the Genospace acquisition to be $0.10 to $0.20 accretive by the end of fiscal 2026 on an adjusted earnings per share basis.\nLet me next move to biopharma services. In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Rx Savings Solutions, a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company that offers affordability and adherence solutions to health plans and employers. Today, we announced the completion of the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, which will be included in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment.\nThe addition of Rx Savings Solutions complements our existing biopharma services assets and supports our vision to improve access, affordability and adherence. We anticipate this transaction will represent a modest headwind to fiscal 2023. We anticipate that Rx Savings Solutions will be $0.50 to $0.60 accretive by the end of fiscal 2026 on an adjusted earnings per share basis.\nAs you've heard me say before and as is the case with all our recent acquisitions, we prioritize the deployment of capital towards growth directly on our stated strategies of oncology and biopharma services in a manner that delivers sound financial returns. These transactions represent capital deployment that make both great strategic and great financial sense.\nMoving to a review of our second quarter fiscal 2023 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Consolidated revenues of $70.2 billion increased 5%, reflecting growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, which were a result of our European divestiture activities.\nGross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 7%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 5%, primarily a result of increased volumes in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 11%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment and lower opioid litigation costs.\nOperating profit was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 6% due to lapping of prior year equity investment gains within McKesson Ventures portfolio and completed divestitures in the International segment, partially offset by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19-related products and net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, operating profit increased 6%.\nMoving below the line. Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, an increase of 22% primarily due to the unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region. These impacts were partially offset by a net reduction of debt year-over-year. And the effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter.\nWrapping up our consolidated results. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 144.1 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchases in fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2023. Overall, second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.06, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year.\nMoving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $60.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, which was partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Operating profit increased 3% to $756 million, led by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially offset by lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.\nThe contribution from our contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.24 per share in the quarter compared to $0.28 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 5%.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by growth in prescription volumes in our third-party logistics business and technology service revenues. Compared to Q1, revenues were lower due in part to the timing of customer-driven promotional activity recognized in the first quarter in our third-party logistics business. Operating profit decreased 2% to $141 million driven by higher operating expenses resulting from the timing of increased head count to support customer annual verification activities, which include hub and patient support programs.\nMoving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9%, as growth in the primary care business was offset by lower sales for COVID-19 tests year-over-year. Operating profit decreased 4% to $307 million driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests, partially mitigated by performance within primary care distribution. Within our Primary Care business, we continue to see the effect of a stronger flu season when compared to the prior year.\nThe contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.33 per share in the quarter compared to $0.44 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%.\nNext, let me address our International results. Revenues were $6.2 billion and operating profit was $137 million, a decrease of 16%. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues were $6.9 billion, a decrease of 25% and operating profit was $151 million, a decrease of 7%. Second quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestitures of McKesson's U.K. and Austrian businesses.\nMoving on to Corporate. Corporate expenses were $144 million, an increase of 73% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had net losses of $3 million related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to net gains of approximately $97 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, the impacts on consolidated results can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment.\nThe year-over-year impact from our McKesson Ventures portfolio was partially offset by lower opioid-related litigation expenses in the quarter. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the second quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million.\nTurning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we made $222 million of capital expenditures, which include investment in distribution center capacity and automation and investments in technology, data and analytics to support growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems.\nFor the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had negative free cash flow of $56 million and $109 million, respectively. Year-to-date, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to our shareholders, which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $139 million in dividend payments. And we have $5.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.\nLet me turn now to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 4% decline to 2% growth for operating profit compared to fiscal 2022. Let me provide updated guidance for contribution from COVID-19 programs.\nOur revised guidance includes $1.45 to $1.65 of contribution attributable to the following items: $0.60 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1 to $1.10 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment; and approximately $0.15 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments.\nWe anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $580 million to $620 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, which we reported in the first half of the fiscal year. As you've heard me say before, it's difficult to predict when gains and losses on the McKesson Ventures portfolio companies may occur, and therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance.\nWhen excluding the impacts related to the U.S. government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, COVID-19 tests and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, we anticipate operating profit to increase 4% to 10%.\nMoving below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects our intent to partially finance the Rx Savings Solutions acquisition with new debt. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% remains unchanged. And based on our second quarter results and continued solid operating performance, including the contribution from COVID-19-related items, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2023 to a range of $24.45 to $24.95 from the previous range of $23.95 to $24.65.\nThe increased guidance also includes the reduced outlook in our International segment from the earlier-than-expected European closing of the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items and net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures' equity investments from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results, our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance indicates approximately 11% to 14% growth over the prior year. This outlook aligns with the previously communicated long-term growth targets, and it demonstrates the commitment to deliver sustainable growth.\nMoving now to the segment outlook. We continue to be pleased with the growth we are seeing in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The breadth of our services and solutions continue to resonate across retail, health systems and provider settings. The value of our core distribution platform was exemplified by the recent agreement in principle to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027.\nWe also anticipate further growth across our oncology ecosystem, including a joint venture between McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute. And we intend to accelerate operating expense investments in the second half of fiscal 2023 to further extend our leadership position in oncology.\nOur positive outlook on the growth trajectory of this segment is reflected in our updated ranges. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 3% to 6%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.60 to $0.70 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution to the U.S. government, a result of the previously disclosed contract extension through July of 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 5% to 7% operating profit growth, which is above the long-term growth target.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 16% to 22%. We will continue to invest and build capabilities that focus on increasing access, affordability and adherence solutions for patients. The acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions accelerates our capabilities. This segment continues to perform in line with the trajectory assumed in our long-term outlook, and its growth over the last few years reflects the ongoing investment and focus.\nIn the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 4% to 8% and operating profit to decrease 3% to 6%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1 to $1.10 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government, which incorporates the contract extension with the U.S. government to January of 2023. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 11% to 15%.\nFinally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 27% to 33%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we have closed to date, including the recently closed transaction with the PHOENIX Group.\nFor fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.85 to $1 per diluted share primarily in the first 9 months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and contribution related to held-for-sale accounting from the transaction with the PHOENIX Group.\nWe are pleased to have closed the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. This transaction closed earlier than we had anticipated, negatively impacting prior operating profit guidance, and is the main driver behind the change in guidance for this segment.\nLet me conclude my fiscal 2023 outlook remarks with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows, including the timing and progression, have been impacted by European divestiture activity and other transactions. For fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses.\nOur free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. our North American businesses continue to generate strong free cash flow. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. We will continue to prioritize growth, principally in the areas of oncology and biopharma services, as evidenced by our joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, the acquisition of Genospace and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions.\nWe also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares in fiscal 2023, which we anticipate will be largely complete by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately 142 million to 144 million.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our first half fiscal 2023 performance. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies gives us the confidence and visibility to raise our earnings guidance. We continue to create value for our share owners through solid growth, cash flow generation and return of capital. Our strong leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people across McKesson gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nCEO & Director, McKesson Corporation\n\nThanks, Rachel, and thanks to everyone joining us on our call this afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2023 results with strong growth in total company revenue and adjusted operating profit across the North American businesses.\nAs a result of our first quarter performance and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $22.90 to $23.60, to a new range of $23.95 to $24.65. Successful execution against our company's priorities, priorities of people and culture, sustainable core growth, streamlining the portfolio, and expanding the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems are really what underpin our fiscal 2023 outlook and our long-term growth framework. So I wanted to center my remarks today around those themes. And I thought I would start maybe with a highlight of the progress we've made against our company priorities, and then I will wrap up with a few brief comments on the performance in the business itself.\nFoundational to our company, foundational to our company's history, quite frankly, and our strategy are really the core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. As we expand the reach of our services, we remain focused on generating sustainable growth in these core businesses. Our operational excellence and ability to leverage our scale with global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be a partner of choice for our customers.\nOver the past 2 years, you're well aware, we've been working closely with the U.S. government to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary kits. As requested by the U.S. government, our contract to serve as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccines was extended through July of 2023. Similarly, the contract for ancillary kits and storage was extended through January of 2023. We are -- well, we continue to be honored and privileged to be able to leverage our distribution scale and expertise and to continue to support this important public health effort. Brent will comment a little more specifically on the financial impacts of these contract extensions, but we continue to look forward to serving the U.S. government for several more months in this capacity.\nI mean, building upon the success of the core distribution businesses, we -- I'd like to say, we're tackling some of the most complicated problems in health care through the expansion of our oncology and our biopharma services ecosystems. In the first quarter, we were really excited to announce the formation of a joint venture between McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA's -- HCA Healthcare-Sarah Cannon Research Institute. This transaction marks a really important alliance between these 2 companies, and we expect it will accelerate our strategic advancement of the oncology ecosystem.\nBy combining the resources and the expertise of these 2 organizations, we're creating an expanded clinical research network, and that really means the broader portfolio of clinical trial offerings, expanded patient reach, access to a broader set of data and more advanced analytics capabilities to better match patients with clinical trials. The new joint venture will really also aim at accelerating drug development and increasing availability and access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those patients in underserved communities.\nThis transaction enhances our proposition to biopharma companies and further advances our differentiated offerings across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle. It is also purposeful. It reinforces our commitment as a company to advance health outcomes for all. We expect to close the transaction by the end of calendar year 2022, and we look forward to the partnership, the collaboration and greater outcomes we can bring to the patients we collectively serve.\nWe're also making meaningful progress on expanding our biopharma services ecosystem. Through years of intentional investment, we've built a suite of innovative biopharma solutions that supports really every phase of the medication life cycle across nearly all therapeutic categories. We're reinventing how biopharma companies, providers and payers can connect to each other through technology with the ultimate goal of really helping patients access, afford and adhere to their medications.\nToday, I thought I might share a few examples around our affordability efforts and how these efforts fit into our biopharma ecosystem.\nA key piece of our innovative medication affordability product suite is our automatic couponing program. This automatic couponing program really applies co-pay offsets or savings for qualified medications right at the point of dispensing using our technologies that seamlessly integrate it into the pharmacy workflow. We further help patients stay on their trusted brands through multichannel support options like activity informed messaging about other discounts, real-time support and educational materials. We also facilitate patient assistance programs, which are a critical financial safety net for millions of patients.\nWe implement and administer comprehensive patient assistant programs through program pharmacies, which enable access to free medication programs to eligible patients treated at hospitals in community care settings, and sometimes, even at home. Both of these solutions leverage the reach of our technology network, and in fiscal year 2022, our solutions enabled patients to save more than $6 billion on brand and specialty medications. And importantly, we prevented more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned. By improving affordability of prescriptions, in many instances, these solutions also improve adherence, helping patients stay on the treatment longer which leads to better health outcomes.\nAs we look ahead, we continue to be proud of our differentiated assets and capabilities, and we're excited to bring innovative solutions to more partners and patients. Oncology and biopharma services both represent large, complex and growing markets for McKesson, and we're strategically positioned to continue to enhance value in these areas.\nI want to talk a bit about our next priority, which is streamline the portfolio. It's absolutely imperative that we continue to focus our human and our financial capital into the highest growth and highest margin areas of the company. And part of that is the continued assessment of our portfolio for strategic alignment. This includes the progress we're making towards fully exiting the European region. We recently entered into an agreement to sell Denmark, and the transaction was closed on July 29, 2022. The pending transaction with the Phoenix Group is progressing well. We characterize it as on track and has an expected close in the second half of our fiscal 2023.\nNorway really remains the only country that we have not yet announced an agreement to sell. So now 1 year after we announced McKesson's strategic intent to exit the European region. We've entered into agreements to sell or we have completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries in Europe. So I'm really pleased with the execution of this important initiative. I think the teams have got after with remarkable speed and efficiency.\nI want to wrap up my review of our company's priorities by reaffirming our focus on people and culture. In fact, it's typically the first priority we mention. We believe that talent can truly be differentiating, and we continue to invest in the development of our employees. We provide our employees not only competitive compensation and competitive benefits, but also the resources and support they need to grow into the next generation of leaders for McKesson.\nAs an organization, we're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion, and we continue to increase leadership representation for women in North America and people of color in the U.S. In fact, just recently, McKesson was recognized by Forbes as 1 of the best employers for women achieving an industry-leading ranking. This is a demonstration of our outstanding progress in promoting equity and diversity in the workplace and really, in my view, reflects our deep commitment to support all employees at McKesson, all employees at McKesson.\nAdditionally, for the seventh consecutive year, McKesson was named the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, which includes earning a top ranking score of 100 on the 2022 Disability Equality Index. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on all our company's priorities and we can clearly see it helping advance our long-term growth.\nBefore I turn over -- before I turn my attention to our first quarter results, I did want to just provide everyone a quick update on the progress of the opioid-related litigations. This past quarter, we reached agreements in principle with the state of Washington and the state of Oklahoma. With the recent developments, we have settled or we've reached agreements to settle the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. The majority of the payments that we'll fund as part of these settlements will be used on opioid relief programs. We're particularly proud of that, and we'll support a wide variety of strategies in local communities to help fight opioid crisis.\nIn July, after a full trial a federal judge ruled at McKesson, along with 2 other distributors, could not be held liable to 2 West Virginia subdivisions for contributing to the opioid crisis. This ruling is significant as the court confirmed that McKesson did not cause an oversupply of opioids in these communities. As we move forward, our role in combating opioid abuse is not over. McKesson will remain part of the solution when it comes to relief across the country and in preventing opioid diversion within the pharmaceutical supply chain.\nLet's move on to business performance. And I want to start by just providing a few comments on the macroeconomic trends and environment that we're seeing and what the potential impacts are on McKesson's business. In the past quarter, we have observed positive prescription volumes and positive patient utilization trends. Additionally, as the macroeconomic environment continues to evolve, our business model has remained resilient to the pressures from cost inflation and supply chain disruption. The impact from these macroeconomic factors was immaterial in Q1 and we do not anticipate any incremental impact in addition to what was already contemplated in our fiscal '23 outlook.\nWe remain confident in our ability to navigate a dynamic economic environment. We have a diverse set of products and solutions that allow us to follow the market demand and capture evolving opportunities. And we remain committed to supporting our customers and partners by delivering innovative products and solutions and making quality care more accessible and affordable.\nLet me quickly summarize the first quarter performance, and then I'm going to turn it over to Britt, who will provide additional financial details. I want to start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. We delivered solid first quarter performance in core pharmaceutical distribution, led really by our differentiated value proposition and exceptional service to our customers.\nThroughout the quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in prescription volume with positive trends in both branded and generic drugs. Our distribution expertise is reflected in the breadth of product offering, delivery accuracy and reliability of our service. We also remain focused on expanding the oncology ecosystem to strengthen our already differentiated market position.\nThe advancements not only reflected in financial performance and its increasing contribution to the segment growth but also demonstrated by the research we published, the insights we generated and the partnerships we formed, all focused on empowering innovation and advancing cancer care. Our oncology business has proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic, and we saw stable demand in patient visit trends within our U.S. oncology practices.\nIn Prescription Technology Solutions, we're pleased with the growth momentum in the first quarter, driven by access affordability and adherence solutions. The market demand for our products and solutions remain strong, contributing to the organic growth in the core product categories. The strong financial performance also allows us to reinvest into the business and to expand the reach of our biopharma services ecosystem. The continued investment in innovation is critical to the long-term growth of the business.\nIn the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we again had strong performance, led by strength in the primary care marketplace. The demand for COVID tests during the quarter was higher than anticipated, but I would also say generally in line with the COVID case counts. We continue to expand the breadth of our products and services to strengthen our leading capabilities in the alternate site market.\nAnd in the International segment, we're progressing well with the divestiture of our European assets. As it relates to our Canadian business, we remain committed to our strategy in the Canadian market, where we have scale and a diverse set of assets. The distribution and retail businesses remain stable, and the team is doing great work driving growth through improved sourcing economics and expanded customer relationships.\nAll right. Let me try to pull everything together. McKesson reported solid first quarter in fiscal 2023. The fundamentals of our business are stable, and I'm excited about the meaningful progress we've made against our company priorities. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2023 aligns with the long-term growth targets of the business and demonstrates our commitment to deliver sustainable growth across all segments.\nLast, I want to be sure to thank my teammates and the employees of McKesson. I'm proud to lead this amazing team. You're all innovative problem solvers that bring positive change to our customers and partners. It's the dedication and the execution from each and every one of our employees that's driving McKesson forward and ultimately helping advance health outcomes for all.\nWith that, Britt, why don't you provide some additional color and comments.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McKesson Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We are pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to grow our businesses and execute effectively as a diversified health care services company. Our fiscal first quarter results are ahead of our expectations, reflecting progress against our strategic priorities, demonstrating the continued strength of our operations.\nLet me begin today with a few company updates before reviewing our first quarter results, and I want to start with Europe and our ongoing focus to streamline our portfolio. Over the past 2 years, we've taken deliberate actions to streamline the business and deploy capital more effectively, ensuring the organization is operationally efficient, and delivering solutions that are focused on solving our customers' biggest challenges. This is exemplified by our actions to exit European region announced in July of 2021. Since that time, we've divested or entered into agreements to sell business operations in 11 of the 12 countries in which we operate. To date, we've successfully closed the following transactions.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and we completed the sales of our Austrian business and the remaining share of our German joint venture. In April of 2022, we completed the sale of our U.K. retail and wholesale operations. And in July of 2022, we completed the sale of our Denmark business. The transaction with the Phoenix Group to sell operations and other certain assets in several European countries is also proceeding well. We anticipate it will close in the second half of fiscal 2023, subject to regulatory reviews. We continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit remaining operations in Norway, the only country and we've not yet entered into an agreement to sell.\nFor fiscal 2023, we anticipate our remaining European operations will contribute adjusted operating profit of approximately $0.85 to $1.15 per diluted share, which includes accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting through the transaction with the Phoenix Group. As discussed at our December Investor Day, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures.\nExiting operations in Europe allows us to focus on another important strategic priority. Expanding our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. And we took an important step this quarter in our oncology ecosystem. In June, we announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare Sarah Cannon Research Institute, including the acquisition of Genospace, Sarah Cannon's personalized medicine platform. The combination of these assets complements our existing operations.\nIt aligns to our strategic growth priorities and it supports our vision to improve care in every setting. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of calendar year 2022, again, subject to regulatory review and approval. We do not anticipate this transaction will have a material impact on our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share outlook.\nNext, as Brian mentioned earlier, our contract with the U.S. government to serve as a centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccine was recently extended through July of 2023. And the contract for the kitting and storage of ancillary supplies was extended through January of 2023. I'll discuss the impact of fiscal 2023 guidance later in my remarks.\nFinally, I want to point out 1 additional item that will impact our fiscal second quarter GAAP-only results. In July of 2022, McKesson exited 1 of its investments in equity securities for proceeds of $179 million. We will recognize a GAAP-only gain within other income in the second quarter.\nMoving now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2023 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis unless I state otherwise. Consolidated revenues of $67.2 billion increased 7%, reflecting growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the European divestiture process. Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 4%.\nExcluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 9%, a result of organic growth in our Medical Surgical Solutions segment, increased volume of specialty products in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and growth in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment.\nOperating expenses decreased by 10% in the quarter due to completed divestitures in the International segment. As a result, operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 4%, led by growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and improved prescription transaction volumes in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19-related products and services and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, operating profit increased 13% year-over-year.\nInterest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decrease of 8% due to a net reduction of debt year-over-year, and the effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter.\nWrapping up our consolidated results. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 145.9 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, resulting from share repurchases throughout fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Overall, first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.83, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year.\nNow on to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12, and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $56.9 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year, resulting from increased specialty product volumes led by retail national account customers and market growth, which was partially offset by brand to generic conversions.\nOperating profit increased 4% to $711 million, led by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, generic launches and improved performance of Ontada, which was partially offset by lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.18 per share in the quarter, which is compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nExcluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 9%. Results in the quarter benefited from the timing of generic launches and the improved performance of Ontada.\nOperating margins were modestly lower in the quarter, impacted by mix as the growth from health systems and multi-specialty providers were partially offset by robust retail national account customer growth which contributed 7% to the overall 14% year-over-year top line growth.\nNext, as Brian noted earlier, our Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered another strong quarter. Response to our access, affordability and assurance solutions continue to be strong across biopharma, providers and payers. The scale and expanded suite of offerings continue to deliver for all stakeholders including patients.\nRevenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year, driven by volume growth from Biopharma Services which includes third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 19% to $165 million, reflecting the continued favorable market acceptance to a growing set of access, affordability and adherence solutions.\nMoving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 3% year-over-year. as growth in the primary care business partially offset anticipated lower demand in sales for COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program.\nOperating profit increased 4% to $268 million, driven by strength across the primary care business. Improved volumes and greater incidence of respiratory illness and the flu contributed to higher testing and patient visits in the primary care business. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of these COVID-related items, the Medical Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 20%.\nNext, let me address our international results. Revenues were $6.5 billion, and operating profit was $138 million, which was a decrease of 19%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $7.1 billion, a decrease of 23%, and operating profit was $152 million, a decrease of 11%. Our first quarter results reflect the impact from the divestitures of McKesson's U.K. and Austrian businesses.\nMoving on to Corporate. Our Corporate expenses were $145 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we recognized a tax receivable gain related to our previous change health care investment and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $19 million in the first quarter. We anticipate that the fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses to be approximately $45 million.\nDuring the quarter, we had net losses of $22 million related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio, which compares to net gains of approximately $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, the impacts on our consolidated results can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. It's difficult to predict when gains or losses on the McKesson Ventures portfolio companies may occur, therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance.\nLet me turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow can be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we made $100 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. For the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1 billion.\nWe also returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders during the June quarter, which included $1 billion of share repurchases and $71 million in dividend payments. In July, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. And the Board also approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which brings the total remaining share repurchase authorization to $6.3 billion.\nOur fiscal 2023 guidance for share repurchases remains unchanged. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board of Directors and management have in the execution against our strategic priorities.\nOur capital deployment principles remain firmly in place. We prioritized growth by investing internally and through M&A. Our focus continues to center on the areas of oncology and biopharma services, including the expansion of access affordability and adherence solutions.\nNext, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of the framework focuses on a strong balance sheet and financial position. which is underpinned by the maintenance of our investment-grade credit rating.\nLet me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook, starting with the consolidated view. I'll walk you through the key items, beginning with additional details of fiscal 2023 consolidated guidance. A full list of these assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation.\nOn a reported basis, our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and flat to 6% operating profit decline compared to fiscal 2022. When excluding the impacts related to the U.S. government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution programs, COVID-19 tests and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, we anticipate adjusted operating profit to increase 4% to 10%. We also anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $550 million to $620 million, which included the impact of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in the first quarter. Given the current interest rate environment, we now anticipate interest expense to modestly increase and be in the range of $205 million to $225 million. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% remains unchanged.\nBased on our first quarter results, our continued solid operating performance in each segment and the contract extensions with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, we are increasing our guidance range for fiscal 2023 to $23.95 to $24.65 from the previous range of $22.90 to $23.60. Our fiscal 2023 outlook aligns with the previously communicated long-term growth targets, and it demonstrates the commitment to deliver sustainable growth.\nOur revised guidance also includes $0.99 to $1.29 of contribution attributable to the following items: $0.35 to $0.45 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 test in the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies in our Medical Surgical Solutions segment, and $0.11 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments.\nExcluding the impacts of these COVID-19-related items and net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments from both fiscal 2023 guidance in fiscal 2022 results, our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance indicates approximately 10% to 15% growth over the prior year.\nMoving now to the segment outlook. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, our outlook reflects the solid operating performance in the first quarter, the efficiency and durability of our core distribution platform and continued development of our oncology ecosystem. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 11% to 14%, and operating profit to decline approximately 1% to 3% growth year-over-year. Our outlook includes approximately $0.35 to $0.45 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution, a result of the previously outlined contract extension. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 4% to 6% operating profit growth, which is modestly above the long-term growth target.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we now anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 21%, and operating profit growth of 16% to 22%, which reflects increased affordability solution volumes.\nIn the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 3% to 7% and operating profit to decrease 5% to 10%. Our outlook includes approximately $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government, which incorporates the contract extension of the U.S. government to January of 2023. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19 related items, we anticipate medical surgical operating profit to increase 11% to 17%.\nAnd finally, in the International segment, we continue to anticipate revenues to decline by 34% to 38%, and operating profit to decline by 22% to 28%, and this year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to date and those we expect to close during fiscal 2023.\nLet me conclude our fiscal 2023 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. In fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter. Each working capital metric can be impacted by timing. And in fiscal 2023, a our cash flows, including the progression of these cash flows may be impacted by European divestiture activity.\nOur fiscal 2023 outlook incorporates plan to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. A significant portion of the share buyback assumption is associated with mitigating the year-over-year impact of European divestitures. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately 142 million to 144 million.\nTo wrap up, we are pleased with our solid start to the fiscal year. We continue to deliver on our growth strategy as a diversified health care services company. Our talented associates continue to deliver exceptional performance. Our first quarter financial performance reflects their dedication and their execution in a dynamic operating environment, and it also represents the resiliency of our portfolio. Looking ahead, the combination of our solid first quarter financial performance, our growth strategy and continued execution positions McKesson to deliver sustainable long-term performance and shareholder value creation.\nWith that, let me turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nCEO & Director, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. Today, we announced our fourth quarter results, marking a solid finish to our strong fiscal 2022. Thanks to the dedication and excellent execution from Team McKesson, we made outstanding progress against our company priorities and in our transformation to a diversified health care services company.\nWe achieved 31% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share when excluding the impacts attributable to COVID-19-related items and net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We have good momentum across the enterprise. We saw strength in our core distribution business and our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. We remain focused on the company priorities which are foundational to our sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value creation. My remarks today will be centered around these themes.\nBefore I jump into company priorities, I do want to talk briefly about the recent developments in opioid litigation. In February, we announced the approval of the proposed opioid settlement agreement. 46 of the 49 eligible states and the District of Columbia and all eligible territories joined the settlement, representing more than 98% of the eligible political subdivisions that have brought opioid-related suits against us as calculated by population under the agreement. The resolution delivers much needed relief for the impacted communities. It will collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States approximately $19.5 billion over 18 years. The agreement became effective on April 2. The approval of the settlement agreement also removed a significant portion of operational and financial uncertainty in the business, allowing us to redirect resources for more focused execution on our company strategies.\nIn addition to the 46 states participating in the previously announced agreement, on April 4, an agreement was reached in the Alabama matter, in which McKesson will pay $141 million and an additional $33 million in attorney's fees and costs to resolve the opioid-related claims of the State of Alabama and its subdivisions. On May 3, an agreement was also reached in the Washington matter, in which McKesson will pay $197 million, consistent with the State of Washington's allocation under the previously announced comprehensive settlement framework as well as certain additional attorney fees and costs. This resolution will result in the settlement of the State of Washington and its litigating subdivisions. That will bring the total number of states settling opioid-related claims with McKesson to 48 of 49 eligible states and the District of Columbia.\nAs a company, we remain deeply concerned about the impact the opioid epidemic is having on individuals, on families and communities across the nation, and we continue to be committed to be part of the solution. This includes our controlled substance monitoring programs, advanced customer purchasing analytics and many, many other initiatives.\nLet me now take you through our company priorities and the progress we made in fiscal 2022. We are excited about these initiatives as we continue to deliver strong results and improve our strength as an organization. After our fiscal 2022 discussion, I'll walk you through each of the operating segments and lay out how they are positioned for growth as we head into fiscal 2023.\nFor the last several years, the enterprise has centered its strategic, its operational and financial decisions around our set of company priorities and the results have been outstanding. We fundamentally changed the trajectory of the company from declining financial performance to sustainable growth across the business. Through the focused execution of the priorities, we improved efficiency, we defined our differentiated and strong market positions and we established the right to play and win in oncology and the biopharma services markets.\nNow let me briefly walk you through the progress on each of them. I'll start with our first priority, which is our focus on people and culture, our ICARE values, our enterprise-first mindset and our commitment to Team McKesson, our commitment to each other, were critical to successfully navigating the last few years. We are committed to being the best place to work in health care, and our best talent strategy is accelerating our business momentum.\nIn fiscal 2022, we made investments in our workforce, including the frontline workers, through additional labor investments in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments in the back half of our fiscal year. Our company culture, our purpose, our mission and the investments we've made in our teams underpin our performance as a business.\nOur people and culture strategy is integrated with our continued focus on ESG initiatives, ensuring we not only do good business but we do business the right way. As an impact-driven organization, we embrace our responsibility to enable lasting changes in the communities we serve. Over the past year, we made great progress in many areas, particularly around advancing access to care, health equity and climate action for health.\nTo promote diversity, equity and inclusion, we have set specific and measurable goals to increase representation of both women and people of color amongst our leadership ranks. We released our employment information report, including our EEO-1 data, to improve transparency and accountability and equal employment opportunities. We also launched company-wide inclusion training, fostering positive behaviors and teaching ways to address bias in the workplace.\nOur commitment to diversity starts with our Board as evidenced by the recent successful completion of our Board refreshment. In April, we announced the election of Roy Dunbar as the new Director of the Board. Mr. Dunbar brings decades of experience in technology, operations and health care and will be instrumental in guiding the company's strategic priorities.\nIn addition to the appointment of Mr. Dunbar, in fiscal 2022, we elected a new independent Chair of the Board and introduced 3 other new Board members with diverse backgrounds and experience. Women and people of color now represent 50% of our Board of Directors, and we look forward to benefiting from their leadership and their stewardship.\nMoving to our second priority, which is driving sustainable core growth. At the core of our offering is the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical distribution solutions. Building upon the momentum in fiscal 2022, we continue to innovate and invest in our distribution assets and capabilities. Some of the latest advancements over the past year include automated picking and packing solutions and robotics, which help us improve productivity, so we can pick more accurately, pack medications faster and ultimately serve our customers better.\nWe're also expanding the reach of our core business by entering adjacent markets while maintaining operational excellence. A great example of this is our patient home delivery service. Leveraging our scaled distribution network, we help our partners deliver medical-surgical products directly to patients' homes nationwide. With an increasing demand in virtual and home care, we've seen significant growth in this channel in the past few years. Our best-in-class customer service and deep expertise in distributing medical-surgical products enables us to capture the market opportunity, ensuring the right product to the right patient at the right time.\nWe also continued to partner closely with the U.S. government in its COVID-19 response effort. It's been more than a year now since we started shipping the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies. Through March 31, we have successfully distributed over 380 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States and in support of the U.S. government's international donation mission. Although the contract with the U.S. government to serve as a centralized distributor is expected to end in July, this experience has been a strong testimony to our vast and scaled supply chain capabilities. And I am incredibly proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic through our focus on meeting the needs of the health care community.\nIn early fiscal 2022, we announced our intent to exit the European market, which aligns with our company priority to streamline and simplify the business. Over the past 12 months, we've made significant progress as we have successfully entered into agreements to sell the operations in 10 of the 12 countries. We've completed the divestiture of the Austria and U.K. businesses and our German joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Bringing all the in-process transactions to closure and exploring strategic alternatives for the remaining countries is a top priority in fiscal 2023. The actions we're taking in Europe build upon our deliberate efforts over the past years to maximize the organization's operational efficiency and focus our resources on the highest growth opportunities.\nThe last company priority that we're excited about is the expansion of our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. At our Investor Day in December 2021, we shared details about our differentiated assets and capabilities in these 2 areas. We believe that these ecosystems can help solve complicated problems and, importantly, improve patients' lives. The goal to help ease the frictions and eliminate inefficiencies in the health care system and to improve patients' lives is what motivates us continuously to innovate and to execute.\nOur biopharma ecosystem represents a scaled network of assets and capabilities that are highly differentiated. Within the ecosystem, we're expanding the reach of our products and services that aim to improve access, affordability and adherence. In the past year, we helped patients save more than $6 billion on branded and specialty medications. We helped prevent more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients access their medicine more than 67 million times. We created an ecosystem that's more efficient and more valuable to the customers and patients than each of the pieces would be standing alone. The cohesive business strategy and coordinated go-to-market solutions are both critical, enabling continued growth in this segment.\nIn our oncology ecosystem, we're strategically positioned to improve cancer care with a range of services and solutions. Our distribution and GPO capabilities continue to provide patients access to life-saving drugs, including biosimilars. Combined with our reach through the U.S. oncology network, we help promote awareness and bring more affordable treatment options to both providers and patients.\nA great example is our U.S. oncology research, which continues to play a central role in accelerating research and science. As one of the largest community-based oncology research programs, it has contributed to more than 100 FDA-approved cancer therapies. Last year, nearly 900 physicians actively accrued patients to clinical trial. And through Ontada, we're leveraging the reach and resources across the ecosystem to generate real-world data and evidence. We've published more than 200 real-world studies in leading industry publications for over 70 oncology indications. We are now serving the top 15 global life sciences companies, providing them valuable services to accelerate research and commercialization.\nAs I reflect on our progress against the company priorities, I am very excited to see the meaningful impact it's brought to our business, our customers and to patients. The strategy is working and will continue McKesson's growth journey into fiscal 2023. I'm confident in our ability to continuously execute, innovate and deliver sustainable profit growth for the long term.\nNow let me turn to the performance over the past 12 months and how we're positioned for success heading into fiscal 2023. First, I want to share an exciting update on our ESG initiatives. At the beginning of fiscal 2022, we committed to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets. We have already submitted our targets to the Science Based Targets initiative for official validation. Through initiatives across operations and supply chain management, we're setting measurable and specific goals to reduce both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, building a more sustainable business and, ultimately, serving the health of patients and communities.\nNext, let me provide some observations on volume and utilization trends. We're encouraged by the prescription volume and medical visit levels across the business. We've seen continued improvement in pharmaceutical prescription volume, oncology visits and primary care patient visits. While recovery in certain markets, like extended care, may be lagging, we are seeing other markets recover close to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate the positive trends to continue in fiscal 2023.\nIn U.S. Pharmaceutical, we saw stability in the distribution fundamentals reflected in solid growth in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2022. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this business derives from a few factors. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in the core distribution assets, expanding and strengthening our capabilities and unlocking new efficiencies in the business.\nOn the generics and branded front, the fundamentals of the pricing environment remain stable and generally track in line with our expectations. Our balanced approach of managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products allows us to strengthen our competitive position and enables us to be resilient and flexible to market movements.\nWe remain focused on the investment and expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We're pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets from provider solutions in the U.S. oncology network to our data and our insights business Ontada. They are critical pieces to the long-term growth of this segment, and we're excited to capture the market opportunity and further our progress in fiscal 2023.\nIn Prescription Technology Solutions, we saw another year of adjusted operating profit growth driven by expansion of our product offerings as we bring more brands onto the platform and increase transaction volume as the market recovered. A good example of growth in this segment is our access for more patients, or AMP, solution which was developed and launched about 3 years ago. The solution is focused on automating benefit verification and hub enrollments for patients. And in fiscal 2022, we saw accelerated growth with 25% increase in the number of brands on the program. It has contributed to the overall growth across the enterprise and, more importantly, helped patients get on therapies up to 8 days faster and stay on therapies longer, driving better health outcomes.\nWe anticipate innovations like this will continue to fuel growth and strengthen our differentiated product offerings. Our future innovations and investments will be centered around expanding the reach of our current products into adjacent markets, such as specialty brands and medical benefits. We continue to invest into the future growth of this segment.\nMoving on to Medical-Surgical, which has performed exceedingly well this past year. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 items, the underlying Medical-Surgical Distribution business grew at a double-digit rate for adjusted operating profit. The lab business that we highlighted before is just one of the drivers for this outstanding growth trajectory. Recovery in the primary care market and our expansion of selling prescription drugs into the non-acute channel also contributed to the segment.\nLooking ahead, as a leader in the alternate site market, we believe that this segment is well positioned as more site of care moves into the communities. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture this growth opportunity in the years ahead.\nIn the International segment, our strategy and commitment to the Canadian operations remains unchanged. McKesson Canada is a leader in pharmaceutical distribution in the country and has a portfolio of valuable assets, including the retail banner groups Rexall, specialty pharmacies and digital offerings such as Well.ca. We will continue to build and grow this business.\nIn summary, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made in fiscal 2022 to further our transformation into a diversified health care services company. Looking ahead to our fiscal 2023, our guidance of $22.90 to $23.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes organic growth of the underlying businesses, improved operating leverage and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Excluding the contribution from COVID-19-related items in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 and net gains from McKesson Ventures in fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to grow 9% to 14% year-over-year.\nWe expect the adjusted operating profit growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology and Medical-Surgical segments to be in line or above the long-term financial framework we laid out at our Investor Day last December. We anticipate the market to remain dynamic, particularly as it relates to supply chain and inflation. We're confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to minimize any potential impacts. Our fiscal 2023 guidance does not assume a material headwind from supply chain disruption or sustained price inflation. Britt will walk you through the additional details that we've included in the outlook.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2023 we're excited and energized to build on the momentum and to capitalize on our strong market position. We're advancing our transformation to a diversified health care services company, extending our long tradition of innovation and evolving our business while reaffirming our strong commitment to addressing the changing needs of our customers, their patients and the broader health care industry. Our success in building differentiated assets and capabilities positions us well to support better health outcomes and to accelerate profitability and healthy growth for the company.\nI want to conclude my remarks by acknowledging our employees who are dedicated to bringing insight, products and services to our customers and partners. Thanks to their execution and their commitment to McKesson and to each other, we're improving care in every setting one product, one partner and one patient at a time. We are truly enabling better health for all.\nThank you for your time this afternoon. And now I'm going to hand it over to Britt.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 results, then I'll outline our fiscal 2023 guidance.\nAt our Investor Day in December, we discussed the transformation underway at McKesson. Distribution remains a core part of our company. However, we continue to advance and grow as a diversified health care services company built on differentiated assets and strategies we're executing, delivering sustainable earnings growth across our businesses.\nAs we articulated then, our confidence is based on 3 interconnected factors: the successful focus to advance McKesson's oncology and biopharma services ecosystem, leveraging our best-in-class assets and capabilities; effective allocation of capital, including streamlining our portfolio; and the momentum we've been generating through operating and working capital execution. We remain confident that we'll achieve the long-term targets that we've provided for fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nLet me start by discussing our focus to streamline the portfolio with an update on Europe. In early fiscal 2022, we announced our strategic intent to exit the European region. The transaction to complete a full exit of our European operations allow McKesson to streamline the portfolio, aligning future investments to our growth strategies in North America. We've made good progress, and we remain committed to the set of actions.\nIn July of 2021, we announced the transaction with the PHOENIX Group to sell operations in 6 countries and other certain assets. The transaction is proceeding well, and we anticipate it will close in the second half of fiscal 2023.\nWe have successfully closed the following transactions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business to Quadrifolia management, and the sale of McKesson's remaining share of our German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. Recently, we completed the sale of McKesson's U.K. retail and distribution businesses to AURELIUS, which closed on April 6. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a GAAP-only charge of $343 million related to our agreement to sell the U.K. retail and distribution business. Finally, we continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit our remaining operations in Norway and Denmark.\nIn fiscal 2022, our European operations, including held-for-sale accounting treatment impacts, contributed $409 million of adjusted operating profit or $1.97 per diluted share. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our remaining European operations will contribute approximately $0.85 to $1.15, which includes accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting for the transaction for the PHOENIX Group. As I mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures.\nLet me now move to a review of our fiscal 2022 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise.\nFiscal 2022 was another year of strong execution for McKesson. We're exiting the year with solid operating performance, delivering fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.83 and, for the full year, earnings per share of $23.69. Our full year results included revenue and profit growth across every business segment.\nIn addition to growth in our core businesses, fiscal 2022 earnings per diluted share also included the following 3 items. The first is $1.79 related to the U.S. government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution program, which included $0.89 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution and $0.90 related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies. $0.88 was related to COVID-19 tests, and finally, $0.47 related to net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. Excluding these items and the impact of fiscal 2021 inventory impairment charges related to personal protective equipment and other related products, fiscal 2022 earnings per diluted share increased 31% year-over-year.\nFor the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues of $66.1 billion increased 12% driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment due to increased volumes of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.\nGross profit was $3.4 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6%, primarily driven by our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, resulting from prior year inventory charges on PPE and related products and increases in patient care visits in our primary care business. Gross profit was also positively impacted by increased volume with new and existing customers in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment.\nOperating expenses in the quarter increased 4% due to increased volumes in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, which were partially offset by the impact of held-for-sale accounting on announced divestitures in the International segment. Operating profit of $1.2 billion for the quarter was an increase of 3% led by solid operating performance across the segments, partially offset by the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government and lower contribution related to COVID-19 tests. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19-related products, net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and the prior year PPE impairments in the Medical-Surgical segment, operating profit increased 8%.\nMoving below the line, interest expense was $43 million in the quarter, a decrease of 17% due to the net retirement of approximately $1.1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2022, including a previously announced tender offer in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nOur tax rate was 21.9% for the quarter. And ramping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 149.2 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year resulting from share repurchases throughout fiscal 2022.\nMoving now to fiscal fourth quarter and full year segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12, and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.7 billion, an increase of 14%, driven by increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.\nOperating profit decreased 4% to $780 million due to lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines declined sequentially, as demand continued to lessen along with continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions. COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nAs a reminder, fiscal fourth quarter operating profit growth included previously announced investments made in response to the competitive labor market. On our earnings call in February, we reiterated our expectation for additional labor-related expenses to ensure continued service continuity through the second half of our fiscal year. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the previously outlined labor investments, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 4%. For the full year, operating profit increased 8% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 29% as a result of volume growth related to biopharma services, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Operating profit increased 11% to $162 million driven by growth from access and adherence solutions. For the full year, operating profit was $590 million, an increase of 26%.\nNext, Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 6% due to growth in the primary care business. Operating profit increased 55% to $298 million. In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment included $0.22 of earnings per diluted share contribution related to COVID-19 tests and $0.20 of earnings per diluted share contribution related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines for the U.S. government. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items and the prior year inventory charges on PPE-related products, operating profit increased 26% due to growth in the primary care business. For the full year, operating profit increased 50% to $1.2 billion. When excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items and prior year inventory charges on PPE and related products, operating profit increased 22%.\nDuring the fourth quarter, COVID-19 and the direction of the disease continued to demonstrate variability. The demand for COVID-19-related products and services has fluctuated over the course of the pandemic. However, the direction generally followed the volume of COVID-19 case levels. Forecasting COVID-19 vaccine distribution and testing demand more than a few months at a time remains difficult. We continue to track new guidance and variants.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we experienced increased demand in January related to a spike in cases due to the Omicron variant. We experienced a 60% volume increase related to COVID-19 tests in January compared to the average in the third quarter. In February and March, COVID cases declined month-over-month with a corresponding decline in COVID test volumes. In March, experienced approximately a 90% decrease related to COVID-19 test volumes compared to the third quarter average. The declines in February and March led to lower earnings contribution from COVID-19 tests in our fiscal fourth quarter. We anticipate that the pace of COVID test volume and vaccine demand will follow a similar fluctuating pattern in fiscal 2023, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 COVID volume and earnings per share contribution will be materially lower than fiscal 2022.\nLet me address our international results. Revenues were $8.5 billion on a reported basis. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $8.8 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by sales to new customers in the Canadian business and year-over-year volume recovery in our distribution businesses, partially offset by the divestiture of our Austrian business, which closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nOperating profit increased 7% to $147 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, operating profit increased 10% to $152 million due to the reduction of depreciation and amortization on European assets under agreements to sell and increased volumes in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business. For the full year, operating profit on an FX-adjusted basis increased 40%.\nAnd in our Corporate segment, expenses were $183 million in the quarter, an increase of 46%. During the quarter, mark-to-market valuations related to our equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio resulted in net losses of approximately $6 million compared to net gains of $44 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Corporate expenses were $579 million for the full year, which were approximately flat compared to the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2022, McKesson had net gains related to our equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio of approximately $98 million or $0.47 per share. This compares to net gains of approximately $132 million or $0.60 for the full year of fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies, and we are pleased with the insights and the portfolio results that we've obtained.\nThe impacts for a consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. It's difficult to predict when gains and losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. And finally, in the fourth quarter, we incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $26 million and incurred $130 million for the full year fiscal 2022.\nTurning now to our cash position and capital deployment on Slide 13. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, which included $535 million of capital expenditures. We continue to focus capital deployment to drive value for our shareholders.\nSince fiscal 2018, we've returned $11 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, over $9 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 31%. In fiscal 2022, we returned $3.5 billion through share repurchases, including $1.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $277 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 97% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2022.\nOur strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation, continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our strategies, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a strong capital structure.\nLet me spend a few minutes now discussing our outlook for fiscal 2023. We entered fiscal 2023 with solid momentum, building upon the strong fiscal 2022 results. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items, beginning with additional details on our fiscal 2023 consolidated guidance. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 14 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation.\nWe remain confident in the fundamentals of our North American health care services and distribution businesses. We'll continue to invest in innovative product offerings that further enhance our leading roles in the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes flat to 4% reported revenue growth and 4% to 10% operating profit decline compared to fiscal 2022.\nExcluding the impacts related to the U.S. government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution programs, COVID-19 tests and net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, which were recorded in fiscal year 2022, we anticipate operating profit to increase 3% to 9%. We anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% and corporate expenses in the range of $520 million to $590 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we finalized the broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities. While we've reached a broad settlement, there are cases that remain open. As it relates to opioid litigation expenses, we previously communicated that we anticipate a substantial reduction in fiscal year 2023, resulting from the settlement. For fiscal 2023, our current approximation is $40 million, and it can vary based on a number of factors, including remaining nongovernmental suits, trials and pace of legal proceedings, and we'll continue to update you accordingly.\nWrapping up our consolidated guidance, our fiscal 2023 earnings per diluted share outlook is $22.90 to $23.60, which includes $0.20 to $0.60 of contribution attributable to the following COVID-19-related items: $0.05 to $0.20 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution; less than $0.05 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies; and $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests.\nExcluding the impacts of these COVID-19-related items from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the $0.47 related to net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in FY '22, our fiscal 2023 guidance indicates approximately 9% to 14% growth over the prior year. This estimated year-over-year growth is consistent with the long-term financial targets that we provided at our December Investor Day event and represents solid organic growth in our underlying businesses, disciplined capital deployment and continued expansion of our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem.\nMoving now to our segments. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, our outlook reflects the efficiency and durability of our core distribution platform and continued expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 7% to 10% and operating profit to approximately be flat to 4% decline year-over-year. Our outlook includes approximately $0.05 to $0.20 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which is aligned to the current contract timing and volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government. This compares to $0.89 in full year fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 3% to 5% operating profit growth, which is consistent with the long-term growth target we provided for the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment at our recent Investor Day event.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 17% to 23% and operating profit growth of 14% to 20%. This outlook reflects momentum of organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand partnerships with biopharma manufacturers, generate a higher transaction volume and increase the number of brands under access and adherence platforms.\nIn the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 7% to 11% and operating profit to decrease 15% to 21%. Our outlook includes approximately less than $0.05 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. And this compares to $0.90 in fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our contracts with the U.S. government are scheduled to end in July of 2022.\nWe also anticipate approximately $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests in fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19-related items, we anticipate operating profit to increase 8% to 14%, primarily as a result of growth in the primary care business. The Medical-Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services throughout the alternate site market, including growth from laboratory solutions and the government sector.\nFinally, in the International segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decline by 34% to 38% and operating profit to decline by 22% to 28%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to date and that we expect to close during fiscal 2023. In Canada, we have a strong position as the leader in health care distribution. We anticipate continued organic growth in our pharmaceutical distribution business, including strategic sourcing efforts.\nLet me conclude our fiscal 2023 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. As I communicated at Investor Day, our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth complemented by a return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a modest yet growing dividend. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. This flexibility positions us for the continuation of sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nIn fiscal 2023, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter impacted by timing, which could include the timing of planned European divestiture activity. As discussed at Investor Day, we intend to offset the dilution related to our European divestitures with capital deployment.\nAs indicated on Slide 18, our fiscal 2023 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. A significant portion of the share buyback assumption is associated with offsetting the year-over-year impact of the European divestitures. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately 142 million to 144 million.\nThe progress we're making across our strategic priorities, including our commitment to streamline the business, supports our strong cash flow. This cash flow provides us with the flexibility to deploy capital through organic and inorganic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nIn closing, fiscal 2022 was another strong year for McKesson. We continue to make great progress on our transformative journey from a distribution-focused company to a leading diversified health care services company, accelerating and expanding our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Our strategies are working, and we're delivering for our customers, partners, patients and our shareholders. We are well positioned to capture the vast opportunities in the growing markets of oncology and biopharma services. We have a strong financial outlook, and our financial framework and execution position us to deliver sustainable profit growth, cash flows and shareholder value creation. We have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Thank you.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Rodriguez\n\nThank you, Keith. Good afternoon and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian S. Tyler\n\nCEO & Director, McKesson Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2022 results, another quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all 4 segments, reflecting strength in the fundamentals across our businesses. Our focus and execution against our company priorities positions us to consistently generate strong financial results despite fluidity we continue to see in the macroeconomic environment.\nBefore I discuss the business performance, I would like to just quickly remind everyone of our company priorities. We have been sharing with you our strategic transformation to a diversified health care services company centered around a set of 4 enterprise priorities. We believe the execution against these priorities is critical to our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth, and we want to reiterate our focus and commitment to each one of them.\nOur first priority is our people, our teams and our culture. Through our diversified portfolio of assets and operations, we as a company touch and impact many aspects of health and the health care system, including patients. Embedded in our daily operations is our purpose: advancing health outcomes for all and our mission of building an impact-driven organization.\nWe have been focused on enabling change in 3 areas: improving access to health care, advancing health equity and protecting our environment. In the past year, our employees came together and shared countless moments of impact, finding new ways to get involved and to contribute. In 2021 alone, we completed more than 26,500 volunteer hours and supported nearly 1,500 charities. I couldn't be more proud of what we have achieved so far, and I'm confident in our ability to build a brighter future that, in fact, offers greater health outcomes for all.\nPart of our focus on culture is our continued improvement in diversity and inclusion. We put a particular focus on hiring, developing and promoting what we call a best talent strategy at McKesson. Recently, we were recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality, the ninth year in a row we've received this honor.\nOur commitments to diversity and refreshment includes our Board of Directors. In January, we welcomed James Hinton and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson as new independent directors to our Board of Directors. Both James and Kathleen have served in multiple senior leadership roles within the health care industry. Currently, Jim serves as an operating partner for the private equity firm, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stone. And prior to that, he held the role of Chief Executive Officer at Baylor Scott & White Health.\nAnd Kathleen most recently held the role of Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resource Officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, where she led the human capital strategy, including merger integration and HR transformation through digitization. Their decades of health care experience and proven record leading complicated organizations and executive leadership roles will be instrumental to McKesson, and we are excited to welcome them to our Board.\nAdditionally, we announced today that Don Kanouse has been elected as the next independent Chairman of our Board, which will go into effect on April 1, following a planned transition led by our current Independent Chair, Edward Miller. I want to thank Ed for his years of steady leadership and invaluable contributions as the Independent Chair to McKesson's Board of Directors. And I also want to welcome Don to his new role. He brings deep leadership expertise and shares McKesson values, culture, strategy and vision, including his commitment to Board diversity. We look forward to his leadership and stewardship.\nOur next priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. We have a vast scale distribution network and deep expertise in global supply chain management, which have been a critical and foundational part of our long history. We're proud of our operational excellence and our ability to capture efficiency and deliver consistent and high-quality service to our customers while optimizing operating margin.\nBuilding off of this core capability, we've been very successful in expanding into new product categories and new adjacent markets, like our lab solutions and our government partnership strategies. Our scaled assets and capabilities also enable us to play an integral role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud to serve as the centralized distributor of vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government.\nWe've also been working closely with our partners, suppliers and manufacturers to navigate the complex supply chain system. These relationships have allowed us to continue to provide stability of supply and low cost for our customers. And as a result, we've been able to manage through some of the challenges that the market has been seeing.\nOur third priority is to streamline the business, which includes initiatives like the split off of Change Healthcare and our strategic intent to fully exit the European region. We recently announced the sale of our Austrian business, which was completed on January 31, and we have agreements to sell 10 of the 12 countries where we operate. As a reminder, Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell.\nWe continue to work towards the closing of the other pending divestitures. These transactions are the result of our intentional effort to evaluate and assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We believe that by fully exiting the Europe region, we'll be able to better focus our human and financial capital into higher-growth and higher-margin areas, which leads me naturally to our next company priority.\nThe last company priority is our strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services. Over the past few years, we set out to accelerate the growth in these 2 areas and build out what we refer to as ecosystems. As we shared at our Investor Day in December, these are both large and growing markets that have significant unmet needs and opportunities, and we are tackling some of the most complex problems in the health care system with the goal to bring efficiency and benefits to all stakeholders across these ecosystems.\nIn the oncology ecosystem, our growth strategy is centered around our support for the large, growing and diversified US Oncology Network. With the reach of over 1,400 physicians, The US Oncology Network treats 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S. at 1 of its 500 sites of service. One of The US Oncology Networks important initiatives is its participation in the oncology care model, which is a 5-year experimental payment model with the goal of bringing down the cost of cancer. Based on the latest results, The US Oncology Network practices participating in the program achieved high marks on quality metrics and provided significant cost savings to Medicare. By representing approximately 1/4 of all providers participating in the program, The US Oncology Network demonstrated its leadership role in transitioning health care to a more value-based approach.\nBuilding upon our deep reach in the community oncology space, we're creating an oncology ecosystem with multifaceted service offerings that are all interconnected. At the center of this connectivity is Ontada, an oncology, technology and insights business dedicated to help advance cancer research and advance patient care. We recently highlighted this business at our Investor Day. Since its launch in December of 2020, the team has made great progress transforming ideas into realities. Ontada signed 2 agreements with strategic partners to improve patient outcome and quality of patient care, and it was instrumental in the launch of the MYLUNG Consortium, which through real-world research and study provides critical information to improve the patient's journey.\nWithin our biopharma ecosystem, we've built a set of differentiated assets and capabilities, including businesses like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads. They're combined under the Prescription Solutions business with a shared goal to improve access, adherence and affordability of medicines.\nOne of the key customers of our business is biopharma companies. Through our scaled and interconnected technology network, we provide biopharma a range of commercialization services and by automating and simplifying the process of prior authorization, we reduced prescription abandonment and provide biopharma access to new patients. Our unique technology capabilities also generate insights into patients' needs and challenges, enabling greater ability to impact patient actions and get better outcomes.\nWe support over 650 brands today, covering 94% of the therapeutic areas, and we're connected to all the major insurance companies and most of the regional payers in the United States. The reach of our network is deep and broad, which is why it's the foundation of our biopharma ecosystem, and we are incredibly excited about the market opportunities it brings.\nOur progress with each of the company priorities has been truly outstanding, and we see the strategy is working. The strong conviction in these priorities will be our North Star as we seek to advance and win in the marketplaces as a diversified health care service company and to drive long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders.\nNow before I turn to our third quarter results, I want to provide a brief update on the progress made towards the broad resolution of governmental opioid-related claims. To date, 46 states, all 5 U.S. territories in Washington, D.C., have joined the proposed settlement. The sign-on period for political subdivisions in participating states to join the previously announced proposed opioid settlement agreement ended on January 26. We have now entered into the evaluation period. The deadline for our decision is February 25, 2022. We continue to work with all parties to bring meaningful relief to affected communities and towards resolutions, which will allow us to further focus on the strategic priorities of our business.\nNow let me get to the results. We're pleased to report a strong third quarter with total company revenues of $68.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.15, ahead of our expectations. As a result of our performance in the underlying business and the contribution from COVID-19-related items, we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95. This is from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95.\nThe third quarter was another example of the nonlinear nature of the recovery from the pandemic. At the beginning of the quarter, volume and utilization trends were recovering as COVID-19 cases continued to decline across the country. Although we expected a nonlinear recovery trend, the emergence in the spread of the Omicron variant in December was unexpected. Since then, we've been closely monitoring its impact.\nOne thing we've learned in the past 2 years is the resilience of our business and our communities. Regardless of the trajectory of the pandemic, we're confident about our ability to adjust and adapt to support our customers and their patients in these challenging times.\nLet's turn to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and increased specialty volume. Through the third quarter and into January, branded pharmaceutical pricing has tracked in line with our original expectations and consistent with our experience over the past several years.\nFor generics, we continue to benefit from the success and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE. We have not only the scale but the procurement expertise to consistently source products at low cost while protecting the integrity and the safety of the supply chain.\nWe are also proud of our role in supporting the U.S. government's pandemic response effort as the vaccine and booster recommendations for various age groups continues to expand and evolve. Through January 31, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 370 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites all across the United States and in support of the U.S. government's international donation mission. In January, the U.S. government extended the existing COVID-19 vaccine distribution contract through July of 2022, which is roughly in line with the first quarter of our fiscal 2023.\nIn Prescription Technology Solutions, the segment had excellent momentum and delivered an 11% increase to segment adjusted operating profit in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we offer a range of commercial services primarily to biopharma companies. And this quarter, the growth was led by third-party logistics services and our access adherence and affordability solutions, including our access for more patients product. This segment aligns with our focus on developing the biopharma services ecosystem. The market that we're focused on presents many exciting opportunities, and we estimate the total addressable market to be around $15 billion with good growth potential and an attractive margin profile. We are pleased with the financial performance and expect to continue to drive growth and innovation for McKesson.\nIn Medical-Surgical, we're navigating a dynamic market while growing the business. With surging demand and a complex supply chain, our employees are working tirelessly to secure and deliver key products, playing an important role in the fight against the pandemic. The dedicated team in MedSurg is the foundation to our business growth, and we continue to invest to ensure operational continuity and excellence.\nAs it relates to our International segment, we continue to benefit from COVID-19-related programs in our European operations in Canada. Through December, we've distributed over 81 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies.\nAs we look forward to fiscal 2023, I'm most excited about the progress on the 4 company priorities. Since the rollout of these multiyear strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2019, we've been very focused on execution, making impact and delivering results. While the pandemic continues to present unknowns, what is certain is that fiscal 2023 will be another year in which we focused on strong execution and strategic advancement.\nOur continued progress towards these 4 priorities will be a key driver to our sustainable profit growth, strong cash flow and shareholder value creation. We continue to focus on the things that matter most, most to our customers, to our patients, to our employees and to our shareholders.\nIn closing, we continue to be excited about our future growth prospects as we meet the opportunity as a diversified health care services company. We have unique and differentiated assets in oncology and biopharma services with unmatched scale and connectivity, and we're strategically positioned to win in these growing markets.\nAnd lastly, before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank our dedicated team, including every one of the 76,000 employees that make up Team McKesson. We share a mission to improve health care in every setting, and that will be achieved only with the dedication and the commitment from our people. And for the opportunity to work alongside this amazing team, I continue to be humbled and deeply grateful. Thank you for your time this afternoon.\nBritt, I'll toss it to you.\n\nBritt J. Vitalone\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McKesson Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal third quarter results, which reflect another quarter of strong performance across the business, driven by operational execution against our growth strategies. In the third quarter, we delivered overall growth compared to the prior year results across each of our segments, including growth over the prior year when excluding COVID-19-related programs.\nLet me start with an update on Europe. We remain committed to fully exit the European region, and the progress of our exit activities are on track. Today, we announced that the transactions to sell our Austrian business to Quadrant Folio Management and the sale of McKesson's remaining share of our German joint ventures to Walgreens Boots Alliance closed on January 31, 2022. The assets involved in the Austrian transaction contributed approximately $1.5 billion in revenue and $50 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. The earnings related to our German joint venture were immaterial.\nNext, pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, we anticipate the pending divestiture to sell McKesson's U.K. retail and distribution businesses will close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and the transaction to sell certain European assets to the Phoenix Group will close in the first half of fiscal 2023. The net assets included in these transactions are classified as held for sale. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes approximately $0.49 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion related to these pending transactions, which is recorded within our International segment. This $0.49 of accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting will conclude once each transaction is closed.\nFor fiscal 2023, we currently anticipate approximately $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion related to the held-for-sale accounting based on their current estimated close date for the Phoenix Group transaction. Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. As previously discussed, we anticipate we will deploy capital to offset dilution resulting from all European divestitures, principally through share repurchases.\nBefore I provide more details on our third quarter adjusted results, I want to point out one additional item that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. We reported a GAAP-only after-tax charge of $829 million related to the sale of retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. to account for the remeasurement of the net assets to the lower carrying amount of fair value less cost to sell. These charges were largely driven by declines in the British pound sterling.\nMoving now to our adjusted results for the third quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 7. As discussed at our Investor Day event in December, we manage the business for the long term, and our financial and strategic framework is focused on shareholder value creation. Our financial framework combines 3 key elements to generate sustainable adjusted EPS growth: organic growth, operating leverage and capital allocation. This framework is once again demonstrated by our strong third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Additionally, our leadership supporting the U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts continues to contribute to growth and the momentum we have built across the business.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by strong operational performance across the segments; COVID-19-related items, which include the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs with the U.S. government; COVID-19 tests in fiscal 2021 impairments for personal protective equipment and related products; and a lower share count.\nConsolidated revenues of $68.6 billion increased 10% above the prior year, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from our retail national account customers; and branded pharmaceutical price increases, which were in line with our initial guidance partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions.\nAdjusted gross profit was $3.4 billion for the quarter, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year, which benefited from the increased contribution from our strong operational performance and previously mentioned COVID-19 programs and related items. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of held-for-sale accounting on announced divestitures in the International segment, adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was $1.3 billion for the quarter, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year, led by strong operational performance across the segments.\nMoving below the line. Interest expense was $41 million in the quarter, an improvement of 25% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter. In wrapping up our consolidated results, third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 153.5 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year.\nMoving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 13. Starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $55 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes from our retail national account customers and branded pharmaceutical price increases, partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in the distribution of specialty products to hospitals and community commissions.\nThe contribution from our contract with the U.S. government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.26 per share in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations.\nIn the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 33%, driven by higher volume growth related to biopharma services, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased 11% to $145 million, driven by growth from access adherence solutions. We continue to experience growth across our broad spectrum, higher-margin capabilities and offerings in this segment.\nWe're pleased with the increased transaction volumes related to our access and adherence solutions and the increasing number of brands that joined our platforms this year. We also experienced increased volumes in our logistics and hub services due to the continued recovery of prescription volumes.\nMoving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by growth in the primary care business and the contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 tests in our Primary Care and Extended Care businesses as compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $330 million, driven by the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, the prior year impact of an inventory impairment charge related to PPE that incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and growth in the Primary Care business. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.31 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations.\nNext, let me address our international results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.5 billion, an increase of 2%, driven by new customer growth in our Canadian business and volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses across the segment, which were partially offset by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 41% to $223 million, driven by the reduction as compared to the prior year of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets classified as held for sale, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and tests in Europe, and strong distribution results in our Canadian business. The held-for-sale accounting in the International segment contributed $0.18 to adjusted earnings in the quarter.\nMoving on to corporate. Adjusted corporate expenses were $159 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $33 million for the third quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $135 million.\nLet me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, we made $380 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we returned $2.2 billion of cash to our shareholders, which included $2 billion of share repurchases and the payment of $206 million in dividends.\nAt our Investor Day event in December, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase program. At the end of our third quarter, $4.8 billion remains on our share repurchase authorization.\nWith this increased authorization, the completed sales of the Austrian business and remaining share in the German joint venture and the anticipated fiscal fourth quarter closure of the sale of the U.K. business, we anticipate executing share repurchases of up to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. As a result, we now anticipate returning approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases in fiscal 2022. Our strong operating performance, combined with our return of capital to shareholders, reinforces our commitment to driving shareholder value.\nLet me transition and speak to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. A full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions can be found on Slide 16 through 18. We continue to anticipate a full recovery of prescription volumes. However, the persistence of COVID-19 and its variants such as Omicron is leading to a nonlinear trajectory. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 8% to 10% growth over the prior year.\nWe continue to see stable fundamentals in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing of mid-single-digit increases in fiscal 2022 remains consistent with both our original guidance and prior year. And our view of the generics environment remains competitive yet stable.\nOur guidance remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and U.S. government and includes the contribution related to our role as the centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution program. We'll continue to update you on the progress and contribution from this program.\nWhen excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in this segment, we anticipate approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. And as a reminder, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022.\nIn our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 32% to 36% and adjusted operating profit growth of 24% to 28%. This growth reflects the strong momentum in the business as we project increased volumes across new and existing biopharma solutions and customers.\nTransitioning to Medical-Surgical. Our outlook assumes 15% to 19% revenue growth and adjusted operating profit growth of 51% to 55% over the prior year. Our outlook includes $0.85 to $1.05 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits and storage programs and $0.75 to $0.95 related to the net impact of COVID-19 tests and PPE impairments and related products. When excluding the impacts of these items in this segment, we anticipate 22% to 26% growth over the prior year.\nOne additional reminder related to our U.S. distribution businesses. On our earnings call in November, we discussed the highly competitive labor market, which continues to persist. We also outlined an assumption for a modest labor-related expense impact to ensure support of our talent strategy and continued service continuity through the second half of our fiscal year.\nBased on labor market trends experienced in the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to anticipate approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year weighted slightly higher in our medical segment.\nFinally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance is 2% decline to 1% growth as compared to the prior year. And as a reminder, this reflects the impact from the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 43% to 47%. This includes approximately $0.49 of adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022, resulting from held-for-sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets.\nTurning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 24% to 27% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $570 million to $620 million, an improvement from the previous range of $610 million to $660 million related to our focus on operating leverage, which we highlighted at our recent Investor Day event.\nLet me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong free cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support sustainable long-term growth. This strong free cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, including investing in our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services, while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our growing dividend and share repurchases.\nOur investment-grade credit rating remains a priority, and it underpins our financial flexibility. For fiscal 2022, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically, we generate a larger portion of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, which could include the timing of planned European divestiture activity.\nWe also now anticipate diluted weighted shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 155 million for fiscal 2022. This includes the impact of the anticipated $1.5 billion of fourth quarter share repurchases mentioned earlier.\nAs a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are raising and narrowing our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $23.55 to $23.95, which is above our previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 37% to 39% growth compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance also includes $2.99 to $3.59 of contribution attributable to the following items: $0.90 to $1.10 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution; $0.85 to $1.05 related to the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies; $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests; and the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.75; and approximately $0.49 from gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, which are within our Corporate segment.\nExcluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 27% to 33% forecasted growth over the prior year. When you pull it all together, our strong performance and our outlook equates to an adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance increase of $1.10 compared to our previous fiscal 2022 outlook provided at Investor Day. The $1.10 adjusted earnings per diluted share increased includes the following: approximately $0.45 driven by strong underlying business performance and operating leverage, approximately $0.22 related to COVID-19 tests, approximately $0.22 related to held-for-sale accounting and reduced opioid litigation expenses, and approximately $0.20 related to MCI interest expense and lower weighted average shares outstanding.\nLet me spend just a minute providing some initial thoughts on fiscal 2023. I want to point out that we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance at this time. However, I thought it would be instructive to walk you through some of the items that could impact fiscal 2023 as we sit here today.\nFirst, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns. We continue to expect a full recovery. However, it is likely to continue to be nonlinear into fiscal 2023, and it could impact the quarterly cadence. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments, our contracts with the U.S. government to serve as the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and to assist with the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies are scheduled to expire in July of 2022. Outside of the contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, we anticipate normal customer renewal activity in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. As it relates to COVID-19 tests, we continue to anticipate that demand will be closely associated with the rate of COVID case levels, and impact from variants will moderate from prior year levels.\nFor the International segment, we anticipate $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion in the first half of fiscal 2023 related to the held-for-sale accounting based on the current estimated close date for the Phoenix Group transaction. We will no longer report revenue, adjusted operating profit or held-for-sale accounting benefits related to these transactions once the transactions close.\nWe anticipate that opioid litigation expenses will remain relatively in line with our fiscal 2022 guidance until we have a completed assessment of government entity participation in the proposed settlement and a final determination regarding that settlement. We'll continue to update you on the outcome of that determination and remaining opioid litigation expenses. We anticipate further investment to support the growth of our 2 key strategies of oncology and biopharma services.\nOverall, we continue to see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2023, and we remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. We'll share more details with you about our fiscal 2023 outlook in our fourth quarter earnings call in May.\nIn closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter, and we have a strong financial outlook. McKesson continues to deliver strong results as we successfully executed against our strategic and financial framework. We continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers, patients and shareholders as a diversified health care services company. I want to thank you and thank all of our employees for all their hard work and dedication.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

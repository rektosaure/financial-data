Chapman\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Dominion Energy, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. We appreciate you joining us. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis quarter's presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the third quarter earnings press release, which is posted in the same location.\nDuring today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking remarks, including comments on our long-term plans, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. We also provide supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on our website.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Last December, we reviewed our corporate plan under the theme of a league of our own. The results we've delivered since then continues to support that theme. From the technologies we're deploying to the major projects we're delivering to the structural cost savings we're capturing and the value we're creating, our results are truly in a league of their own. In fact, in the third quarter, we delivered our highest earnings per share compared to other quarters in a similar price environment.\nLet's start in Guyana, where we're breaking records with production more than 700,000 barrels per day in the quarter. We brought Yellowtail online four months ahead of schedule. It's our fourth and largest development with production capacity of 250,000 barrels per day. Yellowtail was delivered in nearly the same time as previous FPSOs despite a 70% increase in facility weight from its higher production capacity and improvements in GHG performance. We also sanctioned our seventh development, Hammerhead, which is expected to begin production in 2029. And importantly, we're making a positive and growing local impact. Guyanese now make up over 2/3 of the country's oil and gas workforce, more than 6,000 people with more than 2,000 local businesses engaged.\nIn the Permian Basin, another advantaged asset, we set yet another production record of nearly 1.7 million oil equivalent barrels per day. We also acquired more than 80,000 net high-quality acres in the Midland Basin from Sinochem Petroleum. The transaction provides control of drilling locations and opportunities to further deploy our technology to drive greater returns. It's another example of bringing our portfolio advantages to an acquisition ensuring that 1 plus 1 equals 3 or more.\nIn addition, during the quarter, multiple third parties published reports validating the benefits of our lightweight proppant. Last December, we shared how we're using low-cost refinery coke as a proppant that penetrates deeper into fracs. This improves access and flow, which increases well recoveries by up to 20%. Wood Mackenzie reported that our proprietary proppant is delivering significant improvements in resource recovery, supporting our own results. They acknowledge that our upstream integration with refining operations create a strategic advantage that is difficult for others to replicate. And that lightweight proppant is just one of many innovations we're developing to maximize upstream recoveries and grow the value of our unconventional business.\nThis year, we expect about 1/4 of our wells, we use our new patented proppant and roughly 50% of new wells by the end of 2026. This, along with our cube development, pipeline of new technologies and deep inventory of quality acreage is why our Permian production continues to grow well into the next decade. This is an important point as it clearly differentiates us from our competitors. We're talking about reduced investments, peak production or a shift to harvest mode. And our corporate plan update in December, we'll share more on our Permian success and how it's strengthening the value proposition of our broader portfolio.\nNew to the world technologies are also playing a critical role, albeit on a slightly longer time frame in our Product Solutions business. We're making solid progress with new products based on our Proxxima systems. This year, we're tripling production capacity. At the same time, we're continuing to demonstrate significant value and use. With our Proxxima-based rebar, we've demonstrated a 40% improvement in installation efficiency compared to steel. We've also introduced a new one code solution for marine cargo tanks that replaces the standard three code process. This cuts coating time in half, speeds up return to service and deliver significant cost savings. These performance gains are helping us penetrate large established markets in key segments where we're building the foundation of a strong pipeline of opportunities.\nWe've had significant interest in our Proxxima battery enclosures from Tier 1 auto OEM suppliers based on the fast production speed and lightweighting provided by our product. In 2026, we have the opportunity to demonstrate the superior subsea insulation and installation characteristics of our Proxxima products in the oil and gas sector, our own Hammerhead FPSO. And then our rebar and infrastructure opportunities are expected to yield approximately 20,000 tons of cells by 2027. Through our signed MOUs with [indiscernible] Steel, investments in Proxxima based rebar manufacturing facilities will grow over the next two years. This will allow us to scale quickly into these fast-growing markets.\nIn Singapore, we successfully started up our resid upgrade project and are converting low-value fuel oil into high-value lubricant products in diesel using a proprietary catalyst at scale. Project utilization is currently around 80%, ramping to full capacity by year-end with our new-to-the-world base stock on grade and delivery to customers.\nWe've also progressed the development of our revolutionary battery anode graphite that can deliver breakthrough improvements in battery performance. Early feedback from leading auto OEMs and battery producers has been promising. Their testing shows that batteries can be charged 30% faster, providing a 30% increase in effective range and last up to 4x longer. This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of key assets from Superior Graphite, a leader in the graphite and specialty carbon market. Working with their team and incorporating their proprietary technology, we will develop and scale a differentiated graphitization process that has higher throughput, 50% more energy efficient and significantly lower cost than available industry alternatives today.\nWe also commissioned our newest supercomputer, Discovery 6, developed with Hewlett Packard Enterprise and NVIDIA, delivering a step change in exploration and seismic processing. This is the world's 17th most powerful computer. Seismic processing that used to take months now takes just weeks is already having an impact in Guyana, enabling more than $1 billion of potential value capture from increased resource recovery at our first six FPSOs in the Stabroek block.\nOur long-standing focus on and investment in technical innovation is paying dividends. When coupled with the capabilities we've developed in execution excellence, we deliver results that others can't match. You've seen it this year with our global projects organization and the 8 key start-ups we've highlighted to date, which includes some of the industry's largest and most complex projects. Our Proxxima systems expansion and Golden Pass LNG project, both remain on track for start-up around year-end, completing the last 2 of our 10 key 2025 startups. Together, these 10 projects establish an important foundation to our 2030 earnings and cash flow growth plans. They're expected to drive more than $3 billion in earnings contributions next year at constant prices and margin.\nBefore closing, I want to briefly touch on a new tool we introduced in the quarter to make it easier for our retail shareholders to support their company and vote their shares. In September, we introduced a first of its kind free opt-in voting program for our millions of retail shareholders. Typically, only about 1/4 of them, growing almost 40% of the company vote at our annual meetings. We think shareholder participation should be the norm, not the exception.\nOur program approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allows participants who choose to opt in to have their shares automatically voted to support management's recommendations. The program is completely optional, and participants can easily change their votes or opt out at any time. Since implementing it, we've been very encouraged by the positive feedback we've received, especially from other companies looking to replicate the program and make it easier for the voices of their retail shareholders to be heard. This is just one more example of the work we are doing to grow shareholder benefits and value.\nStepping back, looking at the quarter and reflecting on the year-to-date results, we feel good about the progress we're making. We're delivering on all the challenging commitments we made consistent with our track record since the pandemic and setting the pace for industry. We're deploying innovative technologies that are delivering new-to-world approaches, processes and products that drive industry unique value. We're transforming how and where we work to improve our effectiveness and deliver structural cost reductions that exceed all of our competition. We're defining the industry benchmark in project execution for schedule and cost on an unmatched number of projects. And most importantly, we're strengthening our competitive advantages and, frankly, all aspects of our business to deliver earnings and cash flow growth now and far into the future. I'm confident we will remain in a league of our own.\nWith that, we're happy to answer your questions.\n\nJames R. Chapman\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Dominion Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren. Before we move to Q&A, I have a quick announcement to share. Please mark your calendar for our annual corporate plan update, a virtual event this year for Tuesday, December 9 at 9 a.m. Central Time.\nWith that, we'll move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And operator, please open the line for our first question.",

Welcome to Exxon Mobil's Q2 2025 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. We appreciate you joining us. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Kathy Mikells, our Senior Vice President and CFO, is not on the call today as she's recovering from a planned medical procedure. We wish her a speedy recovery. This quarter's presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the investor section of our website. They're meant to accompany the Q2 earnings press release, which is posted in the same location. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussions of our long-term plans, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide two.\nYou can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the website. Now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. This quarter, once again, proved the value of our strategy and our competitive advantages. They continue to deliver for our shareholders, no matter the market conditions or geopolitical developments. We built our strategy to take maximum advantage of Exxon Mobil's uniquely diversified business across multiple markets and products. Products that exist today and new products that are groundbreaking technology will enable for the future. In our upstream business, we achieved the highest Q2 production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago. But it's not just about the volume. We're growing production from assets that deliver the most value. More than half of our oil and natural gas production comes from high-return advantaged assets. We expect that number to climb to more than 60% by the end of the decade.\nOne of our most important advantaged assets is Guyana, where we recently marked the 10-year anniversary of our first oil discovery. With nearly 11 billion barrels of resource, it's industry's biggest oil discovery in the past 15 years. We have three major developments online producing roughly 650,000 gross barrels per day in total, considerably above our investment basis. Our fourth development, and the largest to date, Yellowtail, is next in line and anticipated to achieve first oil next week, delivered four months ahead of schedule and under budget. By 2030, we expect to have total production capacity of 1.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day from eight developments. The success of these projects has established Guyana as the world's fastest-growing economy. It's also one of the reasons, I believe, the Guyana development will prove to be one of the most successful Deepwater developments of all time.\nRegarding the recent arbitration decision, I admit the ruling was a surprise. We were highly confident in our position, and so was CNOOC. This dispute was about protecting our contractual rights. The sanctity of contracts among governments, investors, and co-ventures is critical for the upstream industry. Without it, confidence in large capital investments is undermined. Having co-written the contract with Shell, we understood its intent and believed the contractual language conveyed it. Unfortunately, the tribunal interpreted it differently. While disappointed, we respect the process and the ruling. As we move forward, I hope our investors take comfort in the length we will go to in protecting the value our employees create for the company and our shareholders. With respect to the continuing development of Guyana, the arbitrator's decision changes nothing for us, and we welcome Chevron to the Stabroek block.\nMoving to the Permian Basin, during the quarter, we produced roughly 1.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, which was another record for us. Nowhere is our emphasis on technology and innovation paying off more clearly and immediately than in the Permian, where we have the largest inventory of tier-one acreage. Last year, we increased the total resource from 16 to 18 billion oil-equivalent barrels with the successful development of new technologies. Our team is making great progress on my challenge to double recovery from the industry average of roughly 7%. We continue to make progress on the deployment of lightweight proppant, a patented material made at very low cost, with petroleum coke from our refineries. It is proving to be more effective at keeping fractures open, allowing us to extract more oil and gas from each well.\nOn a 10,000 lateral-foot equivalent basis, we've deployed this in over 100 Permian wells and are seeing improved recoveries up to 20%. That's up five percentage points from what we announced last December. By year-end, we expect deployments to reach roughly 150 more wells. We're also leveraging our advantage of contiguous acreage to drill four-mile laterals without losing any productivity. Others are drilling wells half that length at far greater cost, resulting in much lower capital efficiency. So, while some operators in the Permian are talking about peak production, our current plans grow Permian production from about 1.6 million oil-equivalent barrels to 2.3 million by 2030. With the deep portfolio of technologies we're developing, we have the industry-unique opportunity to drive capital-efficient, high-return growth well beyond that. Turning to our product solutions project startups, we're continuing to ramp up operations at the China chemical complex.\nThis facility supplies China's growing domestic market, the largest in the world, with high-value, consumer-oriented chemical products used in household appliances, hygiene products, and safe food packaging. We're also starting up our Singapore Resid Upgrade Project, deploying new-to-the-world technology that converts the lowest-value molecules at the bottom of the barrel into some of the highest-value products we offer. With this new technology, we've introduced a new lubricant base stock, which we've sold out and have essentially sold out the incremental 20,000 barrels per day of production. We've started up our polyhydrofiner project in the UK, converting high-sulfur gas oil exports to domestic ultra-low sulfur diesel sales. We're now producing renewable diesel at Strathcona in Canada for the first time. This is a key part of our lower-emissions fuel strategy, growing production where policy and economics are supportive of cost-effectively reducing the carbon intensity of essential products.\nLastly, we expanded operations at our new Proxxima systems blending facility in Texas, a critical step to more than tripling production capacity this year. We also signed an MOU with a leading building materials and construction company based in the Middle East to manufacture and distribute rebar made with Proxxima. These are important steps in establishing this new business. In total, our 2025 project startups are expected to drive more than $3 billion of earnings in 2026 at constant prices and margin. This goes a long way towards de-risking our plans to achieve 2030 by 2030. That's $20 billion of additional earnings and $30 billion of cash flow versus 2024 on a constant price and margin basis. In our low-carbon solutions business, our first third-party carbon capture and storage project is now in operation.\nThe project uses our CO2 transport and storage network, the world's only large-scale system, to store up to 2 million metric tons of CO2 per year that otherwise would have been emitted to the atmosphere. We also recently announced our seventh CCS customer contract. This brings total third-party CO2 offtakes to nearly 10 million metric tons per year. In addition, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued the draft Class VI permit for a Rose CO2 storage facility in Texas. We expect Rose to be the first of many storage sites linked to our CO2 transport pipeline. Turning to the status of our Baytown hydrogen plant, the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen project, we've seen mixed progress. As we've said, this is a complicated project that requires simultaneous development of supply, demand, and policy.\nWe were disappointed that under the recently approved 45V tax credit, timing for startup of construction was shortened from 2033 to the beginning of 2028. While our project can meet this timeline, we're concerned about the development of a broader market, which is critical to transition from government incentives. If we can't see an eventual path to a market-driven business, we won't move forward with the project. We're now working to determine if the combination of 45Q and a shortened 45V will provide the support needed to catalyze a broader low-carbon hydrogen market. Beyond that, we're working to translate heads of agreements into firm sales contracts, including exports of ammonia to Asia, Europe, and domestic hydrogen cells. We knew that helping to establish a brand-new product in a brand-new market, initially driven by government policy, would not be easy or advance in a straight line.\nIt's why we focused on low-carbon opportunities aligned with our existing capabilities and advantages. Our strategy provides optionality and flexibility, which is critically important in this dynamic and often uncertain world. I'm pleased to see that it's working. We're strengthening and extending advantages our competitors can't match, with a focused portfolio of advantaged assets operated to the highest standards, world-class execution of large-scale, high-return projects, captured cost savings that exceed all other IOCs combined since 2019, and driving superior earnings and cash flow growth potential, irrespective of the market environment or geopolitical uncertainty. It's why we believe, and more importantly, are demonstrating that we are in a league of our own. Thank you, and we're happy to answer your questions.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, Exxon Mobil\n\nAll right. Thank you, Darren. Before we move to Q&A, I want to highlight that we will be publishing our annual global outlook later this month. That, as normally, as usual, contains our latest views on global energy demand and supply through 2050, which forms the basis of our business planning. So with that, we can move to Q&A. As a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to one question. An operator will ask you to please open the line for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your telephone. The first question comes from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo a lot of good stuff to dive into in the release, but I actually wanted to ask Darren about some comments he recently made in an interview around M&A. I'm paraphrasing a bit, but just talking about seeing opportunities and working to bring some of that to fruition. I want to just unpack that a bit. If you think about your portfolio, you have a really strong organic opportunity ahead, and I imagine that creates a very high bar. And at the same time, you've also talked a lot about the technology you bring to bear, like the uplift highlighting in the release on the Permian. And that may be able to create value in assets that others can't. So when you put these factors together, high bar, differentiated technology, differentiated scale, how does that influence your thoughts on further acquisitions in M&A for Exxon?\nAre there asset types or regions where you see the biggest opportunity?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Devin, and thanks for the question. I think you're touching on, frankly, what is the core of our strategy here, which was to focus on building a unique set of capabilities and competitive advantages that we can then leverage to grow organic value, importantly, which is what we've been very focused on, as you know, but also use those advantages and apply them to other opportunities inorganically to grow and create value and create more value than, frankly, the combination of two entities would normally give. So it's kind of the one plus one has to equal three or more, which we've talked about for some time. We saw that play out, I think, and are continuing to see it play out with Pioneer acquisition, where we're making really good progress at growing the synergies. We started off with two.\nWe announced we're up to $3 billion per year on average over the next 10 years. My expectation as we go into the corporate plan discussion at the end of this year is that we'll update that number even further. So very, very pleased with what we're seeing there. And that opens us up to looking at additional opportunities to do the same thing, where we stay very focused on value deals. We're not really interested in buying volumes. We're interested in building value and building volumes. And that's what we've been doing in Pioneer and what we look for in other opportunities. If you look at Pioneer, the advantages that we brought there was a leading technology and scale. We also, in that transaction, took advantage of accretive talent acquisition and leadership acquisition.\nAnd so we're not looking at G&A as one part of the equation, but as you know, with Pioneer, it was a very small part. Our expectation is that would be true as we go forward. We're not looking to buy companies and then strip all the people out of them. Instead, we're looking to buy companies with talented folks where we learn from them and they learn from us. So that's a really important part of our acquisition strategy. And I guess the other example to point to in terms of that integration and taking advantage of the talent and leadership, the former CEO of Pioneer is now running all of our Permian business, so contributing at a very high level.\nAnd then, frankly, we've got to have the right cultural fit as you bring folks into the organization, an intense focus on safety and environmental care, a focus on efficiency and performance, and then the quality and commitment of people. We've often talked about in our company, we have averaged 10 years of 30 years. We like companies where the employees are committed to the company and the work that they're doing. So those are the things that we're looking for. I would argue that we've got fairly high standards in looking at opportunities, but I think it's what's required to really build a volume/value proposition rather than just a consolidation of volume. But as I said in the interview, we think there are opportunities out there and across all of our sectors, frankly, not just in the upstream, but across all the areas that we do business.\nWe have a very active activity set where we're looking at opportunities. And that's really what I meant in my comments, is we're continuing to keep a really close eye on the waterfront, see where the opportunities are, do a good job of understanding what that unique value creation opportunity looks like, and then see if we can't find something that we can then eventually land. But that's an ongoing and long-term process. So that's the process that we're in today, and we feel pretty good about that.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nMakes a lot of sense. Thanks for the thoughts, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Thanks, Darren, for the comments. I wanted to drill down on slide seven, where you provide some new disclosure about the Permian production potential. There's been a lot that's been said about peak Permian production across the basin. Do you have a different view given your technology upside? Certainly, it seems like you do for your portfolio. In that context, on the back of Devin's question about M&A, is it logical to think that this is the right space for you to be the consolidator in?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Thank you, Neil. And the first part of the question is, are we different or have a different view? And I think the answer to that is absolutely yes. You may recall from very early days when we came into the unconventional space, the challenge at the time that I kind of put into a baseball analogy was we're a long-ball hitter. Everybody in the unconventional space is playing the short game. What's long-ball look like in unconventional? And that led us into the Cube development discussions that we've talked about in the past that initially were, I think, discounted, but now have become the industry standard. And it led to the challenge of, given how early we are in the technical development of unconventional resources, to really push hard on the technology envelope.\nAnd I set a stretch target of doubling that recovery, frankly, as a starting point, because as we all know, the recovery levels are fairly low compared to other resource types. And that's our technology organization, and the changes that we've made have resulted in a very promising portfolio of technologies that we see some significant potential. And we're early in the stages of deploying those and getting results. We've talked about, on that slide, the fact that the lightweight proppant that we shared with all of you in December, that we're actually seeing better results than we had even talked about then, 20% improvement in recoveries. That's just one of many in the portfolio that we're continuing to deploy.\nWe've gotten very aggressive at getting enough of the technology development done and then quickly deploying it to see empirically what are the results that we get as we continue in parallel to develop that. So that work, the early evidence that we're seeing, which frankly, from an external standpoint, will be very difficult to see given the size of our business there and how early we are in these deployments. But that has led us to have growing confidence that the projections that we have past 2030 is an upward vector and will continue to grow. And frankly, we're still, and I would tell you, the technology organization is very committed to delivering on doubling recovery, if not more. And I think that's going to be within our grasp at some point in the future.\nNot there today, but I really like the work that the team's doing and the fact that they now own that challenge. So your point then is, given that unique capabilities, does that create opportunities for the 1 + 1 equals 3? And I say it absolutely does. I think it is a function of finding the right resource base, the acreage that we can deploy that technology on, and then these other criteria that I just went through with Devin. And that's, I think, a huge opportunity for us. We've also got unique technology that we're deploying in the lubricants business. We've also got unique in the chemical business. And so as you go across the portfolio, our technology organization is frankly driving developments across our whole portfolio of businesses.\nThat will lead to better performance in our base case assets and then potentially open up different types of opportunities for inorganic acquisitions.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nDarren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Neil.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Good morning, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nGood morning, Doug.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI hit the beat on the Permian, but I'm going to ask the question again, but a little differently. Slide seven suggests you have a 20-year inventory. I'm not quite sure what the definition of that is. Is it today's production, or is it the 2.3, I mean, in terms of sustaining the 2.3 by 2030? And of course, the arrow is up and to the right. My question is this: obviously, you're on a treadmill in Permian, and it's going to be 40% of your production, and you basically are a dividend company. So it seems to us, at least, that you're pushing the company towards or skewing the company towards higher decline, higher sustaining capital, and presumably shrinking inventory life as you grow the production, which is a big part of the free cash, presumably contributing to your dividend.\nSo how do you think about that risk profile, putting that much of a high decline asset into a long-term dividend visibility anchor to your stock?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nWell, I think, Doug, that the way we think about it is this is just one part of a big portfolio. We've always been faced in the upstream with the challenge of depletion, and finding barrels to replace the depletion rate in the production that we bring online. So that's not a new challenge for the company. We don't think the best way of addressing that challenge is by inventorying value. Our view is you got to strike the right balance between, frankly, the pace at which we develop this is balanced with the progress we're making in technical developments, and making sure that we give ourselves the time to develop the technology to improve the capital efficiency and the cost to bring more on.\nSo my perspective is that we're going to see continued improvements and, one, our ability to the capital that we have to spend to access the resource, and then, two, the recovery that we're getting with that capital. And so I think you're extrapolating from, I'd say, a paradigm of today. Our view is the paradigm of the future will be different. But on top of that, you're going to open up new space with these technologies that, as we just talked about, provide inorganic opportunities. That's a critical aspect of this. We're going to open up new space where other types of resources around the world will benefit from the technologies that we're tapping into. And so it all comes back fundamentally to focusing on core capabilities, growing that capability, and then applying it to opportunities so that we continue to grow the business.\nOur expectation and the challenge that we've given all of our business is continued cash flow and earnings growth. I would couple those two things. It's not good enough to grow cash flow without the earnings. That, to me, says you're just spending too much for the cash. Our plans that we're putting together, the ones that we'll talk to you about in December and the ones that we're building beyond 2030, are going to drive towards this earnings and cash flow growth well into the future, explicitly comprehending the development plans that we have here in the Permian. The 20 years of inventory, that is basically the number of wells we're bringing on every year, wells to sales. That's how we think about that.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Thank you, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nThank you, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steve Richardson of Evercore ISI.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, good morning. Darren, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the downstream projects. Obviously, you've had great success bringing on a number of these major projects this year, but I was wondering if you could talk maybe about lessons learned, Strathcona, and Singapore. Then if you could also talk a little bit about maybe some of your future growth ambitions in refinery, in refining. How do you think about the next wave of opportunities, and are they as fruitful as what the last five years has proven in the downstream specifically?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nSure. No, I appreciate the question. We've had, I would tell you, extremely good success in bringing up these large product solution projects. In fact, if you go back in time, historically, before we formed a centralized projects organization, we had very mixed results across the portfolio of bringing large projects online. And it was a function of the fact that we had distributed capabilities and weren't always bringing the best skill set and capability set to some of our hardest challenges. With the projects organization that we've put in place, and then with the way we reshaped the business and the venture organizations that we put in there, we've had tremendous success in building these projects at very basically leading capital efficiency, and amazingly, have brought these projects on in less time with less challenges than we've ever done in our history.\nAnd so I'm extremely proud of how the organization has brought some of these on. The China chemical complex is by far one of the largest, most complicated grassroots startups we've done for decades. We brought that up in record time and got on to production very, very quickly. I'm really proud to say I just found out this morning that the Singapore Resid Upgrade Project just produced on-spec base stock, which, if you remember, that is taking resid bottom-of-the-barrel and converting it to lubricant base stocks, which has never been done before. Brand new to the world technology at a huge scale, very complicated process, and the organization has successfully brought all that online and got on grade here. So really proud of what they're doing.\nAnd what we're seeing in all these is the opportunity to take very low-value molecules, convert them into high-value molecules, and do it in facilities where we take advantage of the existing utilities and equipment that we already have there. So very low cost of capital, incremental cost of capital. That's, I would just say, is the formula going forward. And so my expectation as we look, we've been concentrating our refinery and manufacturing footprint down to the facilities where we feel like we've got these integrated capability sets that are making a variety of high-value products. I would count on seeing us continue to find opportunities to shift the production make in those refineries and move them up the value curve, get dispose of the lower-value products, and bring in the higher-value products. My expectation is that's where you'll see our investments in the refining.\nI would tell you that the organization today has got some very developed plans, and thinking through what some of those next steps might be. So our view is we need to get these up and running and lined out and running successfully for some time, but we are thinking about what comes next. And then after that, we've also got opportunities in biofuels and using these facilities to, as the demand for that or as regulation demands it, begin to shift feeds and produce more biofuels with lower emissions. We've got more opportunities to recycle plastic. So there's just a lot of things we can do with these facilities.\nAnd it's been, we broke the paradigm of thinking about these as transportation fuels or purely chemical manufacturing facilities and just have started thinking about them as a manufacturing facility with deployed technology and what can we do and what can we make with these things. My expectation is we'll continue to develop new products of higher value. I think the lessons learned is the project organization was a damn good idea and is delivering. We've really allowed, by taking that responsibility off the organization, the businesses and the operations to focus on making sure we can bring these facilities up smoothly and quickly and get on grade quickly. Frankly, all that seems to be working very, very well. So we don't have a lot of scabs to pick at in that area right now.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nCertainly sounds like it. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Betty Jiang of Barclays.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my question. I may be pivoting a bit to the low-carbon businesses. It's interesting to see the contrast from the big, beautiful bill that between the rollback in the hydrogen incentive, but arguably enhancement in the carbon capture incentive. Just curious on your thoughts on how do you see the low-carbon business opportunity set and CapEx evolving versus what was laid out in the December Analyst Day. And specifically on CCS, that 10 million tons per annum is no small feat. So as the credit now is putting carbon utilization and sequestration at parity, does that further open up the opportunity set for projects? Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Betty. So I think the way you recall when we talked about the CapEx, that we had this base level of CapEx, we had the early stage, some of these major projects that were very early stage in our thinking. We kind of broke that level out. And then we had this policy new business broken out. And the intent there was to really reflect, frankly, the challenge of predicting the technology developments that we're putting into some of those projects, but then also the pace at which demand would pick up, the pace at which policy would evolve. And so a lot of uncertainty in how we mapped out that CapEx.\nAnd so we put it in that separate bucket so that all of you would know that while we've got plans in place, they've got a lot more variables than maybe some of our traditional businesses, and so a lot more uncertainty. That, I would say, on the carbon capture side of the equation, we've made great progress. The team has got a lot of additional opportunities in sight. I wouldn't say it's changed dramatically with the additional incentive or the parity. Our plans in the base case were to sequester them. So bringing up the EOR piece of the equation doesn't materially change the plans that we had in place there. But I think really good continued progress and a lot of interest in that space. And of course, we're very advantaged with this large-scale end-to-end transportation system and storage system.\nI think the good news is the administration is really helping with permitting. We're anxious to get the Rose permit in place, and then we'll continue to add more sites, particularly as states get primacy. So I think that business feels like it's in a good place and is on the front end of a growing demand profile for a technology and a carbon reduction opportunity that, frankly, in the portfolio, what could be done is some of the lowest cost in the country. So we feel good about that. So I expect that will, the spending that we had in that profile, it was an aggressive pace in the plan, and I expect we'll continue on that and aren't looking at a lot of big changes there.\nThe blue hydrogen one, which is obviously on, as I said in my prepared remarks, not only from the fact that they've shortened the time to develop the industry, but it's a product that's got an alternative in the market today. And so cost and the cost of production and the price of the product is a big variable with respect to buyers. And many buyers are working their way through that number. And I would tell you today that we haven't landed that. We haven't FID'd it, and we're not going to until we've got secured off-takers so that we have a lot of confidence in the returns that we're going to generate. And so that one, we may say slip versus the original timing. It's a little early to tell, but that's, I think, certainly a strong possibility.\nAnd then I'd say to finish up on carbon capture piece of the equation, low-carbon data centers, as you all know, huge appetite in that space. We're uniquely positioned that if the hyperscalers want low-carbon power and they want it in an expeditious timeframe, we're really the only available option today. And so we'll see how that plays out. I think there is some talk now of maybe gas first, unabated gas, and then ultimately decarbonization later. So that may end up slipping as well. We'll have to see how that piece of it matures. But the good news is we've got a proposition that's available for the market and are working with all the serious players there looking at building data centers.\nAnd then finally, I would just say on the lithium side of the equation, we're continuing to work the lithium technology piece of the equation, very focused on getting that cost down and making sure that when we bring that onto market, that from a cost of supply standpoint, we are very competitive, including competing with the Chinese. And that work's going on. That may take longer than we had anticipated just to get our cost down. So that's how that portfolio is shaping up. But again, I would just emphasize we recognize that when we talked about it as part of the plan and the reason why we broke that capital out, so you could see the less certainty in that spend profile. Everything still, I think we still see good value propositions there.\nBut as I said in my prepared remarks, these things don't all move in a straight line. And so my suspicion is we'll see some of that moving around a little bit. Too early to tell exactly what that looks like, but as we update that and when we get into the plan update in December, I would expect to give you some more details on that.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Super helpful.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nThank you, Betty.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Darren?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nGood morning, Paul.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nExcellent. Has always been a great technology company. In your prepared remark, you're talking about how the $18 billion of the cost-saving target by 2030 and new technology may be able to bring in more opportunity and beyond that. From that standpoint, I mean, two of the biggest rapidly advanced technologies is AI and robotics. Can you help us understand where the biggest opportunities for Exxon in those two areas are and how it will change your workflow, processes, or your ability? I mean, you'll be able to do things that you previously would not be able to do. How much is the potential incremental benefit, cost synergy, or efficiency gain beyond what you're already building into your current target that you could see potentially that is out there?\nWhy do you think Exxon is better than other in the oil industry be able to really take advantage on that? Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Thank you, Paul. Well, you've touched on obviously a very topical technology subject. Frankly, the way that we've reorganized has really put us in a great position to take advantage of that new technology with a centralized technology organization and an organization that has information technology married with the other traditional forms of technology. There's very close collaboration among that whole group. We're taking a very consistent approach across technology vectors as we think about them across the whole company. One thing that we're doing, I think, that differentiates us and will give us an advantage in this space is a corporate-wide ERP solution where historically our company had very fragmented systems across the different businesses that we have established over the years. We have been in the process of converting all that into a corporate-wide ERP system, coming up with a consistent data architecture.\nSo we will have a platform that makes all of our data across the entire corporation and all of our historical data basically available for use and AI-type applications. I think we're going to have a systems construct that is very much aligned with what AI needs to truly make a difference at a corporate level. And I think we're going to have access to a set of data that is far beyond what any other company in the industry has access to. So I think those will be two enduring advantages that will help us take advantage of the technology to find new and better ways of doing things. I will tell you that in this space, it's very early on the technology curve. We've spent a lot of time talking about how best to, in this early stage where resources are limited, prioritize the work that we're doing in AI.\nWe have put the cost efficiency side as a second priority. We understand it's an important one and it will deliver value, but we think a bigger value lever is frankly on the effectiveness side of the equation. And so we're looking better at how we can take advantage of AI to, frankly, make the products that we make at much lower cost and with much better performance parameters, find oil cheaper. You can just kind of go through the list of things that we do to produce the products that we make. We think they're coupled with this data that I talked about, huge opportunities to improve upon that. That will be the first order of business. Obviously, as we implement these things, we're finding efficiencies.\nBut I would tell you in the first stage of this, the efficiencies we find is to free our people up from doing a lot of lower value work and allow them to focus on higher value work so we can bring more value to the bottom line. That's kind of where we're at in that journey. We recognize it will be an evolution. We're at the early stage of that evolution. We're being very thoughtful about how we approach this. We're doing it on a corporate-wide basis so that we're making sure that we take those limited resources and put them on the highest value opportunity set.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nHead of European Energy Research, RBC\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. It was just a quick one on the corporate cost guidance. Just noticed over the last few quarters, it's been creeping up with the 2025 runway. It looks like it's about double 2024 levels. If you could help me understand what is driving that increase and how we should think about it into 2026, that'd be really helpful.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Biraj, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. The expense line you're referring to is driven, I think, largely in 2025 by the very large slate of new projects we have coming online, which, as Darren has just walked through, is very much on track, on schedule, and on budget. The additional item there would be in DD&A, where, of course, this year versus last, we would expect a higher level of non-cash DD&A given the full year of Pioneer in our numbers and given the growth in our production volume and the very same new projects. So I think to the extent going into 2026, we'll revisit that as part of our corporate plan in Q4.\nBut to the extent additional new projects, which would be more marginal next year compared to this, and increased production, which will drive that DD&A, we'd expect continued increase in line with our activity set and production level. That said, an offset to our expenses is always our success in continuing on our path of realizing structural cost savings. This year, today, we've added $1.4 billion to that total. We expect to continue that to get to our $18 billion target by 2030 off a 2019 basis. We see that as effective in offsetting some of the increased expense levels, which is largely activity-driven.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. I would add to that. If you look at the, in 2019, our cash OpEx and look at where we're at today, ex energy cost and ex production taxes, we're actually still lower than we were in 2019 on our operating expenses. So we've offset all the inflation and all the growth that we've put into the business with the savings that we've been driving here since that time. So I'm not sure anybody else could give you the same track record that we've delivered in that space.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nHead of European Energy Research, RBC\n\nYep. Thank you both. I'll follow up offline. Thanks.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, Exxon Mobil\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America.\n\nJean Ann Salisbury\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Good morning. Since Liberation Day, there has been a massive influx of interest in US LNG contracting. And it looks like many more US projects may move forward versus initially anticipated. Do you view this as a structural shift in the market? And does it affect, I guess, either your interest in getting into more US LNG or the timeline for your pre-FID international LNG projects?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jean Ann. The short answer is no. I think the way I kind of think about this is the tariffs and one, frankly, the countries that sign up are going to sign up for energy that meets the demand for their economies. And unless the tariff agreements result in a step change in economic activity, the demand out there around the world is going to be driven by the fundamental base economy and economic activity. And so this is the way I'm thinking about it is just how does that demand get met and from what sources of supply does it come?\nAnd so I'm not sure that, and we haven't seen all the details of it, so I haven't done all the math here, but my initial reaction is what we're going to do is see trade flows maybe change, but ultimately the world's round, and there's still a level of demand that has to be met, and there's still sources of supply that can meet it. So I don't know that it changes the rate or pace of how much new supply comes on given the demand that's out there. For us in particular, we tend to contract up the sales for the capacity that we're bringing on.\nAnd so if you look at what we're doing in Papua or Mozambique as we develop those projects, where, at the same time, our LNG organization is securing sales outlets for those so that when we FID those projects, we have secured sales that are linked to crude. So we've got a good understanding of what the economics are going to look like and what the OpEx is going to look like. And so these short-term things don't really impact how we think about the long-term fundamentals and these long-term investments that we're making.\n\nJean Ann Salisbury\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nVery clear. Thanks, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director of Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on Guyana production. And at the corporate update in December, you talked about lower production than capacity due to production falling off plateau levels. Can you remind us when we should start to see that production plateau start to come off? And then also remind us of activities that you're pursuing to arrest those declines that we should be on the lookout for.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Yeah. I know this has been something that we've gone back and forth on. The organization, what we said was we're going to have 1.7 million barrels per day of gross capacity by 2030 and that we thought our production would be about 1.3. And that was reflecting the best estimates of kind of how declines are working and the steps that are being taken. I would just tell you as a planning basis, based on our experience and history, that's a reasonable basis to project what we're going to see. But I would also tell you that there's nobody on that Guyana team that will be satisfied without not keeping our boats full. So there's a lot of work around infill drilling and how do you optimization.\nAnd so they're never going to completely offset the physical nature of depletion, but there's a lot of effort going into it. And I say that to really, I guess, defer on answering the question, which is I don't know the answer to the question. We have a plan. We've shared that plan with you with respect to our production levels vis-à-vis the capacity. But the organization is looking for every opportunity they can to beat that. And frankly, I'm betting on them.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director of Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nUnderstood. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Good morning. I actually have a follow-up and a little bit of a detailed question on Guyana as well. Looking at the data, both Liza 2 and Payara have recently been running around 270 KBD per day versus nameplates at 220 and 250. So I was wondering if you could talk about some of the debottlenecking efforts you've been doing there and if you view that as a sustainable run rate. And maybe just a follow-up is we have seen output at the Liza 1 ship kind of come down more recently in that 130 to 140 range versus call it 160 KBD in 2024. And thoughts on an infill program to maybe sustain the rate back at full capacity there?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil",
    "content2": "Yeah. So I think on the broader question around the effort the organization goes through to really make sure we're taking advantage of the capital that we put in. Obviously, you have a design basis. You work through what you think it's capable of delivering. And then as you get it up and running, you've got our technology organization, operations organization, all very focused on making sure that we're maximizing the value of the capital that we put in the ground there without compromising any of the necessary integrity and safety parameters. And they've done a really good job of that. We, frankly, do that with all our facilities around the world. I think with the concentrated, the focused technology organization that we now have, that's a big aid in doing that. So my view is we're going to continue to see that with every new project that comes on.\nI would also tell you that as we find those debottlenecking opportunities and we think they're applicable to the next project, we build that into the basis so that we have a clear understanding of what capital is needed to deliver on the volume. And so we're continuing to update the bases and the investment and the design based on what we've learned through the debottlenecking. And then obviously you've got new kit and the team gets started at it again and we debottleneck. So in theory, you ought to see less capacity creep with time because we keep building that in. But the counter-set to that is the innovation of the organization and their desire to continue to demonstrate maximum use of the capital. And so those two are kind of in competition with one another.\nAnd again, I would bet on our organization winning that race and continuing to deliver debottlenecking opportunities as we go forward. But we give you guys the design basis. That's our best estimate. And then we hope for the upside based on the capability and quality of the folks who are getting after that every hour of every day. With respect to, I don't have any data on Liza 1, so I can't answer that specifically. I mean, I would say is on a macro basis, our expectation is you see some of that with natural decline. That's one of the reasons why we've got this difference out in 2030. And so the teams are always working at developing plans. Nobody's satisfied to have spare capital on the ground.\nSo there's a lot of work going on to make sure that we maximize the utilization of the kit we've already invested in. That's the cheapest. That's the highest margin barrel is the ones that you bring online with capital that's already in the ground.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood. Thanks. Maybe a question on the chemical side. Your earnings have been fairly resilient to the bottom here, even with lower margins sequentially this quarter. Can you talk about what has worked well, including the contribution that you're seeing from the China chemical complex? And then maybe your thoughts on where the chemical outlook goes from here.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, I'll start at the back end and work forward. I think clearly really good demand for chemical products around the world, but a lot of supply chasing that demand, which has led to these very challenging margins that you see kind of everywhere and that are challenging companies in the industry. That's my expectation is going to be with us for longer than anybody would like. And we've got to basically either capacity has got to come off, which we're seeing some of that, but that's usually slow to happen. And then demand's got to grow. And if it grows faster, we'll get out of the hole that we're in that much faster. Frankly, we don't count on that as a strategy. We've never banked on calling the market as a basis for running the business.\nOur focus has really been on making sure that when we're in these bottom-of-cycle conditions, that we've built the business and we've invested in the projects that make us successful. And I think what you're seeing today with our results, while not where we'd like them to be, I think we feel pretty good about where they are given the margin environment that we're in and vis-à-vis our competition. And I think what's driven that is a lot of focus on the design of the kit that we put in place, the feed flexibility that we have, and the ability to optimize feed stock to maximize the margin on any one day. It's obviously the locations that we've picked and the structural advantages associated with feed availability.\nIt's the high-value products that we have been purposely focused on and growing and continuing to upgrade production to get to the high-value products. That's a huge driver here. And then we've taken a ton of structural costs out of the business, very, very focused on making sure that we're spending only what we have to to continue to grow the value and to move the product. And so those things, and we worked on that even when margins were very high. I can tell you that at the time, the business was very focused on getting more efficient with a view that ultimately the market's going to come back around. We'll end up in a long period. And so those things are all paying off hugely.\nAnd it's a tremendous credit to the people in that business, their ability to upgrade the feedstock and upgrade the products to high-value products and do it at lower cost. That's a real hat trick there that a lot of organizations struggle to accomplish. But the chemical business that we've got and the people running it have done an excellent job in that space. With respect to China, I would just say we're still in the early days of starting that up. We feel good about the production. And as I said earlier, it's come on real well. And we're basically selling into that market. But that will be, we still haven't got it running up to full rates. And when you've got that kind of capital in the ground, you need to get full utilization. So I would say that's a continuing journey.\nMy expectation is by the end of this year and getting into next year, we'll then be up and running full. That will be contributing at its full potential. Thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Alastair Syme with Citi.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. Good morning, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nGood morning.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nI would love to return to the very first question on M&A because it's quite an important comment I think you made. I mean, I take your point that volume is not a criteria. But do you feel limited by scale? I'm trying to ascertain whether you're sort of talking about bolt-on transactions or something larger in your perspective. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah. No, scale obviously is important, but it's got to be the right kind of scale. And I think the point I was trying to make is if you're going after volume for scale and you're paying for that volume, then you really aren't doing your shareholders. You're not creating any real advantage. And you're not creating any value for your shareholders. And so while it may help from a scale standpoint, if you can leverage, integrate that organization into your existing one, and find significant efficiencies. But beyond that, in our view, that always should be minor to the opportunity set to actually create some unique value. And that's really what we're focused on. So I don't want to discount the value of scale. I just think from a value creation standpoint, you often pay for that.\nAnd so what we're really looking to do is say, where can we uniquely contribute so that what we bring to the opportunity results in an outcome for both sets of shareholders that was more than either one could achieve independently? That's, in my mind, the magic of successful acquisitions and what we're looking for.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, Exxon Mobil\n\nHey, Alastair, just to add to that, a lot of interest in this topic this morning. We set out, as you know, in December, a plan through 2030 to grow earnings $20 billion and cash flow $30 billion. That's flat price, constant margin. Just for the avoidance of doubt, that plan doesn't reflect, and it certainly doesn't rely on any M&A. So this is certainly an opportunistic additional category.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYes. Good point, John.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you, Darren, and Jim.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Lloyd Byrne from Jefferies.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, Darren. Good morning. I was wondering if you can just run through kind of how you're thinking about North American gas today. I mean, you have a lot of vertical integration already. And maybe it goes back to an initial question, but would power ever fit into that? And then maybe just any comment on Golden Pass taking first commissioning gas would be great.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nYeah, sure. Thank you, Lloyd. I think, again, starting with the end of your question, Golden Pass, really good about how that organization, that venture has recovered from the bankruptcy and the progress that they're making on the construction. We still expect them to deliver first gas sometime at the back end of this year or early next year. That's kind of in that borderline at year-end. But I feel really good about that progress and how that group has kind of rallied around and come together and recovered from the challenge of the bankruptcy. So I don't think we've changed any of our outlooks with respect to what we've communicated there before. More broadly, on your question about power, we're not. That's, in my mind, developing a demand signal for gas is not really a value driver for us.\nAnd if you look at our capability set, I don't think when we look at what we do, what we do well, and what we can do uniquely, power generation isn't on that list. We're certainly capable of doing it. And in fact, we've done it all over the world in many of our facilities to enable the things that we do where we think we create unique value. So we're not interested in a power gen business. We have talked about low-carbon data centers and having a power aspect to that. That's really an enabler to the carbon capture and storage. We're interested in data centers, not from the power standpoint, but for our ability to decarbonize them to the extent that these hyperscalers want decarbonized power.\nThat was really when we introduced that in December and started talking about it, was a function of a stated commitment by many of the hyperscalers to reduce their emissions while at the same time trying to aggressively grow the data centers. So with that construct or that objective statements, we thought we could bring a solution set that would facilitate that and do it at the lowest cost available in the marketplace today and in the timeframe that they were looking at. That's why we were interested in the low-carbon data centers. And obviously, power is a piece of that. But if there's no decarbonization that goes along with that or no potential decarbonization that goes along with that, I wouldn't see us getting into that business.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Makes sense. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil\n\nThank you. All right. Thank you, Lloyd.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, Exxon Mobil\n\nThanks, Lloyd. All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Thanks for your questions. We'll post the transcript of this call to the investor section of our website by early next week. That concludes today's call. Hope everyone has a good weekend."

I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. This quarter's presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They're meant to accompany the Q1 earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. We also published a new company overview presentation, which is posted alongside our earnings materials. This document provides some new financial and other perspectives on ExxonMobil. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussions of our long-term plans, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide two. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the website.\nBefore diving into our Q1 results, I want to say a few things about the current market environment and how ExxonMobil is positioned within it. The headlines today are dominated by the uncertainty from tariffs, which is weighing on economic forecasts and causing market volatility. This economic uncertainty, combined with threats of potential increase in OPEC supply, has put pressure on prices and margins. For us, these are not obstacles but are reminders that we built our business with the flexibility to thrive through market cycles. This flexibility makes us stronger now than ever before. Despite increased uncertainty, our strategy is unchanged, our position is strong, and our track record speaks for itself. We have built the business to excel in any market.\nWe stay focused on the things we can control, the things that make us stronger by ensuring our assets are the most competitive in industry, which helps us to deliver leading value in any environment. One thing that sets us apart is our disciplined approach to capital allocation, which ensures we drive long-term growth by investing in advantaged opportunities across our portfolio and through commodity cycles. We don't chase trends. We focus on the fundamentals, making well-informed choices about where and how to deploy capital. Then we execute. Our unique advantages technology, scale, integration, execution excellence, and of course our people have underpinned the transformation of our business. We've spent years cultivating these advantages, so it would be extremely difficult for other companies to replicate what we do.\nThese unique competitive advantages, deployed towards our unmatched opportunity set, equip us to continue executing our proven strategy and enable us to reliably create leading shareholder value again in any market. You've heard us talk about our business transformation. From growing our portfolio of advantaged assets and improving the mix of products we produce and sell to structurally removing costs across our business, we've fundamentally transformed our company and, in turn, our underlying earnings power. You'll recall we've talked in recent disclosures about improving earnings power by about $3.5 billion quarterly since 2019 at constant prices and margins. This is driven by structural earnings improvements, which include our volume and mix improvements, as well as continued efforts to drive structural cost efficiencies. On this slide, we're taking a different look at earnings power, calculating our earnings improvement versus 2019 using the prices we've seen recently in April.\nWe've taken our Q1 2025 results and our Q1 2019 results and adjusted them to this current price environment. Since 2019, even in this weaker market environment, the strength of our strategy and our improvement in earnings power is significant. While our strategic acquisition of Pioneer, which closed a year ago, is certainly a contributor, even more so is the significant business transformation we've delivered over the past six years. In total, our structural earnings improvements have contributed around $4 billion to improving our earnings power, more than offsetting higher inflation and other costs. As with everything we do, we don't just promise results. We deliver them: a proven strategy, relentless execution, and real measurable results. In Q1, our transformed business continued to outperform. We delivered $7.7 billion in earnings, highlighting the differentiated strengths of our portfolio and our improved earnings power.\nUnderpinning our results were continued execution excellence, the strength of our advantaged portfolio, and continued cost discipline across our businesses. The transformation we've executed over the past five years has clearly made us stronger. This is evident in this quarter's results, especially when compared with the same quarter a year ago. We remain laser-focused on investing in competitively advantaged, low cost of supply, high return opportunities, on delivering execution excellence in everything we do, and on driving additional structural cost improvements. The importance of this is evident now more than ever. We're delivering on 10 key project startups in 2025 that are part of a rich pipeline of advantaged opportunities growing both our traditional and our new businesses.\nFrom Yellowtail, our fourth and largest FPSO in Guyana, which has arrived on location and is progressing hookup and commissioning activities, to our 25 KTA production capacity expansion of Proxxima resin, a product with the potential to capture a large share of growing less cyclical markets. In a minute, I'll go into more detail about two of these 10 projects that have now commenced operations: our China Chemical Complex and our second advanced recycling unit in Baytown. More broadly, the delivery of so many major projects in a single year is a testament to the capability of our global projects organization across a diverse range of project types, from upstream to downstream to low carbon, we are delivering. Beyond our traditional businesses, we've also continued our transformation by growing our new technology-driven businesses. For example, composites represent less than 2% of an average car's weight.\nLooking forward, we project that the new high-performance materials in automobiles could reach more than 20% by 2040, consistent with that industry's current lightweighting objectives. Our proprietary Proxxima resins are very well positioned to meet that growing demand. In March, ExxonMobil showcased a revolutionary EV battery case prototype made from Proxxima products that simply can't be produced from existing composite materials. We're aiming to replace steel and aluminum battery cases with solutions that reduce overall vehicle weight and enable more efficient production, allowing Proxxima products to compete and win in this multi-billion dollar addressable market. And that's just one application and just in the automobile industry. And in another example, just last week, we announced our sixth large carbon capture and storage contract. In this case, with Calpine, which operates a power plant near our Baytown facility in Texas.\nWe will transport and permanently store 2 million metric tons per year of CO2, leveraging our Green Line CO2 transport network, the world's only end-to-end CCS system. That brings our total CO2 under contract for CCS with third-party customers to 8.7 MTA. Add the 7.5 MTA from our planned low carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, and we're more than halfway to our aim to permanently store 30 MTA of CO2 by 2030. Finally, we continue to maintain industry-leading financial strength while delivering robust returns to our shareholders. We ended the Q1 with 7% net debt-to-capital after distributing more than $9 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks, more than any other IOC. You can see every quarter that our strategy is succeeding. We're improving earnings by transforming our business to produce more profitable barrels, and higher value products while also lowering costs.\nIn the upstream, we're continuing to grow advantaged production. More than 60% of upstream volume is expected to come from our advantaged assets in the Permian, Guyana, and LNG by 2030. Even at constant prices, this helps lift our upstream profitability another $3bbl from $10 last year to $13 in 2030. In product solutions, we're delivering advantaged projects and significantly growing our high value products. Both are key to driving earnings growth. Our advantaged projects delivered $2.1 billion of earnings in 2024, and we're expecting roughly $4 billion per year more from these and additional advantaged projects by the end of the decade. Nearly all of the advantaged projects coming online in 2025 through 2030 increase high value product volumes. Through the Q1, we've produced roughly 3.5 million tons of performance chemicals, lubricants, and lower emission fuels, more than the same period last year.\nAnd we're on track to achieve 25 million tons of high value product sales in 2030. We also remain committed to taking costs out of the business and to keeping them out. We're not just nibbling around the edges here. While others who seem to be adopting our playbook are just getting started, we've already removed costs at a monumental scale. For the past five years, we have consistently saved about $2.5 billion annually, more per year than some companies aspire to achieve over multi-year periods. While others set small, safe goals, we've been challenging our organization to aim higher with bigger, bolder targets that redefine what's possible. And as a result, we've fundamentally transformed the cost base of our company by delivering $12.7 billion of structural cost savings since 2019. This far exceeds anyone else in the industry.\nIn fact, it's more than all other IOCs' reported cost savings combined. We are not done yet. We have plans to achieve $18 billion in structural savings by 2030. Our first two major project startups of 2025 are the China Chemical Complex and our second advanced recycling unit in Baytown. Both are operational and are ramping production. Our ability to successfully deliver large and attractive advantaged projects at or below cost, and often ahead of schedule, positions us well, especially in challenging market conditions. Our industry-leading global projects organization delivered our China Chemical Complex, an enormous project ahead of schedule and at industry-leading pace and at a significant cost advantage. At present, we've produced on-spec olefins, polyethylene, and polypropylene. When fully operational, the project will have the capacity to produce nearly 1.7 MTA of polyethylene and nearly 900 KTA of polypropylene.\nImportantly, over 75% of the complex's capacity will have the capability to produce high value, differentiated performance chemicals. This greenfield project will not only be competitive, but will also be protected from tariff impacts. It will supply China's growing domestic market, the largest in the world, with high value chemical products that have historically seen demand grow by about 7% a year. That's double the pace of commodity chemical growth. In advanced recycling, we started up our first unit in 2022. Since then, we've improved upon the technology that enables this proven process to convert waste that is difficult to recycle by other means into many valuable products. We've expanded the range of plastic types we can recycle while enabling integration into existing operations without compromising reliability or product quality. Our latest advanced recycling unit in Baytown leverages this technology and commenced operations in early April.\nLike our first unit, it has the capacity to process 80 million lbs per year of plastic waste annually, thereby doubling our capacity. Additional units are now under development across sites on the Gulf Coast and are expected to start up later this year and next, bringing our total advanced recycling capacity to 500 million lbs per year by year-end 2026. Looking at the entire slate of 10 major projects starting up this year across all our businesses, they have the potential to deliver more than $3 billion in earnings in 2026 at constant prices and margins. Now, to cover some of the financial highlights of the quarter. We generated earnings of $7.7 billion and cash flow from operations of $13 billion in the Q1, the highest among all integrated oil companies.\nAs of year-end, our five-year compound annual growth rate of cash flow from operations was double the next highest IOC and nearly four times that of the large-cap industrial group. We are well positioned to navigate market cycles thanks to improved corporate efficiency and lower cost of supply. Since 2019, we've made tremendous strides in reducing structural costs. At the end of the quarter, we reached $12.7 billion of savings, more than all other IOCs combined. Our track record gives us confidence we'll hit our plan to reach roughly $18 billion by 2030. Our ongoing drive to become more efficient has also lowered our breakevens, with plans to further reduce them to $35 per barrel by 2027 and to $30bbl by 2030.\nOur improved earnings power and disciplined capital allocation strategy is designed to deliver unmatched financial strength, giving us the flexibility we need to outperform in any market environment. Our debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 12%, and the net debt to capital ratio was 7%, again leading all other IOCs. All of our successes help ensure predictable and dependable shareholder distributions. In the Q1, our total distributions of $9.1 billion, including $4.8 billion in share buybacks, were among the largest in the entire S&P 500. These distributions, in turn, support total shareholder return, where we've led IOCs and the average of large-cap industrials over the last three years, and rank among the top 20% of companies across all segments of the S&P 500. Looking at the macro environment, a lot has changed since the end of the Q1.\nHowever, as I previously mentioned, our strategy, our company, our people are built for this. Within Q1, crude prices remained roughly flat near the middle of the 10-year range, while natural gas prices improved on stronger global demand driven by LNG exports in the US and colder weather in the United States and in Europe. Sequentially, global industry refining margins were lower, driven by weakness in Asia-Pacific from capacity additions and higher regional feed costs. That global industry margin trend was in contrast to our own energy products business, which generated higher sequential margins based primarily on our majority weighting within the North American market. In fact, on a look-back basis, all the strategic decisions we've undertaken since 2019, including increasing our North American footprint, have contributed over $1 billion to our energy products earnings in the quarter.\nChemical margins stayed well below the 10-year range as growing demand was met by new capacity additions primarily in Asia-Pacific. Our chemicals business performed well thanks to our effort over many years to grow high value chemical products and to rigorously drive down costs. Looking out the window, the economic uncertainty we saw reflected in the markets in March and April may indeed continue. Regardless, as our results show, we've built our business to excel in any market environment. Turning to the quarter, I'll start with an overview of our Q1 results compared with the same quarter a year ago. GAAP earnings of $7.7 billion were down roughly $500 million, driven primarily by market forces across our businesses. However, you can clearly see contributions from our continued investment in advantage volume growth and our structural cost reductions.\nAcross our businesses, these items contributed $1.4 billion more to earnings in Q1 as compared to the same period a year ago. The key drivers for this advantaged growth were the acquisition of Pioneer in Q2 2024, as well as growth in Guyana. This growth was partially offset by lower base volumes as we've continued to high-grade our portfolio, including the recent Nigeria JV and Argentina divestments. Structural cost savings are key in offsetting the upward expense pressure from inflation and from growth initiatives. In Q1 2025, our structural cost savings helped offset these pressures as well as higher depreciation. Favorable timing effects of $700 million were primarily driven by the absence of unfavorable impacts from last year. Now let's look at our sequential results. Q1 GAAP earnings improved from Q4 2024, increasing $100 million.\nAdjusted for prior quarter identified items, earnings improved $300 million sequentially. This was supported by favorable prices and margins in our upstream and energy product segments, and lower expenses. Higher liquids and gas prices and stronger refining margins more than offset slight market headwinds in other segments. Overall, prices and margins were a $600 million help to earnings. As mentioned during the fourth quarter earnings call, we saw higher seasonal expenses at the end of 2024 across segments. In the Q1, we saw the absence of the higher spend from fourth quarter, as well as lower exploration expenses in our upstream segment, resulting in a $600 million help to expenses. Lastly, other items reflect the absence of the $700 million of help we had in the fourth quarter from year-end inventory, asset management, and tax impacts.\nWe also saw net unfavorable forex, tax, and divestment-related impacts in the Q1. The combined sequential impact was a $1.2 billion reduction from the prior quarter. Turning to cash, we generated $13 billion of cash flow in the Q1 as the earnings power of our business reliably delivered again. We continue to consistently deploy capital according to our allocation priorities. First, we're investing in advantaged assets and projects to drive long-term earnings and cash flow growth to the end of the decade and beyond. We invested nearly $6 billion of cash CapEx in the Q1, and as mentioned, are on track for 10 project startups in 2025. We're closely monitoring the changes in market conditions and remain focused on value. If we can improve the NPV of our investments by inventorying opportunities for later, we will do that.\nThe flexibility of our investment portfolio, with over 1/3 of our production coming from short-cycle US unconventional assets, gives us this option. As discussed at our corporate plan update in December, in our newer businesses, if the necessary policy support and market development do not materialize in the timeline we expect, we'll defer or suspend investments. Second, we strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter with more than $4 billion of debt repayment, leaving our net debt to capital ratio at 7%, again the lowest among IOCs. Finally, strong operational results, coupled with a strong balance sheet, allow us to predictably and reliably return excess cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we distributed $9.1 billion, including $4.3 billion in dividends and $4.8 billion in share buybacks, in line with our guidance of a $20 billion annual buyback pace.\nLooking ahead to Q2, in the upstream, we expect scheduled maintenance primarily in Qatar and Canada to decrease volumes by about 100,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day compared to Q1. We also had roughly $100 million of net favorable divestment-related earnings impacts in Q1 that we do not expect to repeat in Q2. In product solutions, we'll have lower scheduled maintenance versus Q1. We'll be ramping up production at our China Chemical Complex throughout the year. This means higher volumes, but not full rates from this asset in Q2. We expect Q2 corporate and financing expenses to be between $600 and 800 million. This range is higher than what we've guided in recent quarters, primarily driven by lower interest income on cash balances.\nAnd finally, as has been the case for a number of years, we expect seasonal tax payments of $2.5 to 3 billion in the second quarter, driving a working capital outflow. To sum up our discussion today, if you come away with one key message, it's that we are built for this. In any market environment, our focus stays the same. Our proven strategy, superior execution, and cost discipline have delivered, and we are well positioned to continue creating leading shareholder value through cycles. Uncertainty will always exist, but with great challenges also come great opportunities. The opportunities in front of us are tremendous, and we are ready to seize them. The companies that will win are those that capitalize on these moments. As we've said many times, we remain steadfast in our approach to capital allocation, and our discipline is without question.\nTo us, capital discipline is not about investing less. It is investing in the right things. You can be assured that we will continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages to capitalize on what can only be described as an unmatched opportunity set. Combining the right advantages, the most attractive opportunities, and the best execution delivers leading results. It is the combination of these things that will drive long-term shareholder value, our primary focus: delivering profitable growth and creating leading shareholder value today and long into the future. Thank you.",

I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This quarter's presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They're meant to accompany the fourth quarter earnings news release which is posted in the same location.\nDuring today's presentation we'll make forward looking comments including discussions of our long term plans which are still being developed and which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

And now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. I'll focus my comments this morning on ExxonMobil's 2024 results and the company we've become. In her prepared presentation available on our website, Kathy dives deeper into our results and long term growth outlook. What our 2024 performance makes clear is that the transformed company we've built is delivering. We strengthened and further capitalized on our unique competitive advantages of technology, scale, integration, execution, excellence, and of course, people.\nWe demonstrated the strength of our consistent strategy now in its eighth year of driving greater value for society and shareholders alike. We set and achieved ambitious objectives. When we say we'll do something, we deliver. We expanded our unrivaled set of opportunities for profitable growth both now and long into the future. The ultimate source of cash distributions and shareholder value is unchanging investments in advantaged high return assets and projects. The proof of our transformation shows up in our performance.\nOperationally, we delivered strong results across the board, including safety, a bedrock commitment underpinning everything we do, reliability, where we achieved record performance in our product solutions business, and emissions, where we've achieved a more than 60% reduction in methane intensity since 2016. Financially, we demonstrated our steadily improving earnings power across a range of metrics. We delivered earnings of $34 billion in 2024, our third highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. Over five years we've grown earnings excluding identified items, a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 30%.\nWe generated cash flow from operations of $55 billion, also our third highest in a decade, to fund profitable growth, maintain our financial strength, and reward shareholders excluding working capital. Our free cash flow more than covered shareholder distributions and we delivered a return on capital employed of 13%.\nOver five years. Our average return on capital employed is an industry-leading 11% when you set aside cash balances and capital in projects that are under construction and yet to start up. Our 2024 ROCE rises to roughly 17% with a five-year average of about 15%.\nOur disciplined approach to investing continues to generate returns well above our cost of capital.\nEvery part of our business contributed to our success. We built the best upstream portfolio in the industry in 2024. We achieved the highest ever production from our advantaged assets and the highest liquids production from our overall portfolio in more than 40 years. In the Permian, we delivered record production from both our heritage ExxonMobil assets and our Pioneer assets. Together the two are even stronger.\nAs we said last month, we now see an average of more than $3 billion per year of synergies from our combined assets, with production growing from 1.5 million oil equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030, a more than 50% increase. This growth will further strengthen US energy security and we'll do it with even better overall environmental performance. In Guyana, we delivered record production from the world's premier deepwater development.\nWe've gone from discovery to 650,000 barrels per day in just 10 years, a pace for deepwater projects the world has rarely seen. The benefits are tremendous. Not just profitable growth for ExxonMobil, but rapidly rising living standards for the Guyanese people. The GDP per capita more than tripling since we started production in 2020. Turning to product solutions, we further enhanced our already industry-leading portfolio by divesting non-strategic assets and establishing the foundation for new-to-the-world products that outperform existing alternatives. The advantaged projects we brought online over time drove record sales of high-value products in 2024.\nOur ongoing shift to a more profitable product mix is a key driver of earnings improvement in product solutions.\nWe also advanced our plans to develop and grow new businesses, most notably our Proxxima Resin Systems and carbon materials, with an estimated total addressable market of $100 billion by 2030. Within low carbon solutions, we demonstrated strengthened commercial interest through additional customer contracts. Equity partnerships, we're the only company in the world today with an end-to-end system capable of capturing, transporting, and storing carbon emissions. At 6.7 million tons per year, we've contracted more CO2 for transport and storage than any other company by far.\nWe're also well positioned to meet surging demand from data centers for low carbon power and on a timetable that alternatives such as nuclear simply can't match. On the hydrogen and lithium fronts, we announced new equity partnerships and offtake agreements that demonstrate the significant market interest these new businesses are generating. Our success in 2024 and every other year is due to our people. It's not just that we recruit the best or that we give them the most challenging assignments to build the best capability. It's our culture, our mindset. When this team takes the field, we expect to win.\nThat drive underpins our value creation in 2025 as well. We'll bring online a full slate of major projects to increase profitable volumes, make more profitable products, and lay the foundation for profitable new businesses. To name a few. We'll start up Yellowtail in Guyana, our fourth and largest development to date. In the Permian. We'll further improve resource recovery using our next generation cube design and patented lightweight proppant. This is the right kind of growth. Low cost of supply, low emissions intensity, and high returns.\nAt our Singapore refining and chemical complex, our residue upgrade project, we'll use new-to-the-world technology to transform bottom-of-the-barrel molecules into a new grade of high-value lube-base stocks. We'll transform high-sulfur low-value export fuels into higher-value diesel for the UK market at our expanded refinery at Fawley.\nWe'll expand our capacity to produce higher value performance polyethylene and polypropylene at our petrochemical complex in China. We'll add new advanced recycling facilities at Baytown to meet the growing demand for certified circular polymers, which has the added benefit of keeping hundreds of millions of pounds of plastic waste from being burned or buried. Earlier this month, we sued the California Attorney General and activist groups for defamation and interference in our advanced recycling business. As our filing made clear, this suit is about abuse of the public trust and the hijacking of the legal system for financial and political gain.\nI want to emphasize that we don't take these actions lightly. Unfortunately, it's another example of what it takes to defend our company and preserve the value we create for our customers, shareholders, and broader society.\nOverall, the major projects we start up in 2025 will deliver more than $3 billion in earnings potential in 2026 at both constant and current prices and margins. This earnings gain excludes the uplift from our Permian growth plans. As we showed at the corporate plan update, ExxonMobil's runway of profitable growth extends long into the future.\nOur new technology-driven businesses such as Proxxima products and carbon materials creates huge opportunities to expand beyond traditional fuels and chemicals into higher growth, higher margin markets that are decoupled from commodity price fluctuations.\nThis year we expect to start up a new facility that can produce 25,000 metric tons of Proxxima products and plan to grow to nearly 200,000 tons by 2030.\nWe're committed to investing in these new businesses in a stepwise fashion. Progresses in tandem with demonstrated success in the marketplace.\nThe change in administrations in the US, I want to say a few words about the right policy framework for a successful energy future. I'll begin by noting that through 2030, roughly 90% of our planned CapEx is allocated to established, fully functioning markets for energy and products that require no policy support. Only about 10% is earmarked for nascent lower emissions markets where market forces have yet to fully take hold. The case in point is our Baytown Low Carbon Hydrogen project, which requires incentives under Section 45B of the Inflation Reduction Act to be economically viable.\nWe believe these incentives are critical to establishing a fully market-based future where hydrogen competes head-to-head with traditional fuels. But the end goal is clear, a system where no energy source remains dependent on government subsidies.\nJust as energy sources should not be supported by governments in perpetuity, they should not be artificially discouraged either, the prior administration's moratorium on new LNG export facilities and its executive order limiting offshore drilling or policy mistakes that the new administration is right to reverse. Oil and natural gas remain essential to economic growth, jobs, and national security both for ourselves and our allies around the globe. Over the longer term, to achieve broad decarbonization, government policy should set carbon intensity standards on products.\nWe believe this is the best way to engage the collective efforts of industry and leverage competitive market forces.\nTo drive further innovation and reduce the most emissions at the lowest cost. Policies must remain technology agnostic. Government should not pick winners and losers. Intensity standards establish a level playing field and have a strong precedent. They were most recently used to successfully and affordably reduce sulfur and marine fuel. In closing, I want to say again how proud I am of the people of ExxonMobil and how pleased I am that we are creating unmatched value for our shareholders.\nCompared to the IOCs. Over the last five years, we've grown cash flow from operations at a roughly 15% compounded annual growth rate, more than double the closest competitor. We've distributed more than $125 billion in dividends and buybacks, $30 billion more than the closest competitor. We've delivered a total shareholder return, compounded annual growth of 14%, 600 basis points higher than the closest competitor.\nLooking ahead, the value creation arc of the company is equally distinguished. We're going to build an even more advantaged asset portfolio with 60% of our upstream production from advantaged assets by 2030. That's nearly the same amount as the next largest IOC's total production. We're going to develop an even more profitable product mix with 80% growth of high value product sales and product solutions by 2030. We're going to be an even more efficient operator, taking an additional $6 billion in cost out of the business. We're going to generate even more earnings in cash on a constant price and margin basis.\nWe're confident we'll deliver by 2030 $20 billion more in earnings and $30 billion more in cash flow. All of which enables us to keep our commitment to sustainable, competitive, and growing shareholder returns. With that, I look forward to your questions.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your telephone.\nThe first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, thank you so much, Darren, and good rundown there. The question I had was really around project startups and specifically Guyana. Can you give us a sense of the key milestones you're watching for in 2025 at this asset, how it continues to track relative to expectations? And there's been a lot of investor debate following the upstream day about what the long term capacity of this asset could look like? So any thoughts on terminal plateau would be great.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. Good morning, Neil, and thanks for the question. I'd say, as you look across the portfolio of projects that we've got slated for startup in 2025, we feel really good about where they all are. The fact that they're tracking.\nConsistent with what we've talked about publicly, and in fact my guess is that many of them will come in slightly ahead of that. With respect to Yellowtail specifically, I'd say we really like what we're seeing there. I think that team who's managing the Guyana developments continues to demonstrate project after project that you just find new ways to innovate and to overcome the challenges and to deliver these things below budget oftentimes and certainly ahead of schedule. And my guess will be for Yellowtail that will come in a little better than what we've publicly talked about.\nBut Q3 2025 is a good number, a good date to be thinking about longer term. I know I've been part of the conversation in December about what we project going forward in the capacity versus utilization.\nAll I would say is that that's a challenging, you know, to project that far in the future. There's a lot of variables that go into the developments across all of our upstream portfolios. We're going to move from where we're at today of roughly 10 reservoirs to roughly 40 by 2030. A lot of optimization that goes around that managing those reservoirs. A lot of unknowns. Obviously, there's a depletion curve that continues to bring volumes down. But at the same time, our teams are working hard on infills and keeping the utilization up. So we've given our best guess or estimate as to where we'll be.\nBut I would tell you that Neil, myself, all of us, frankly, including the team who's managing it, are challenging themselves to make sure that we're fully utilizing those assets.\nMy expectation is, as we've demonstrated over the last several years, we'll probably do better than what we're estimating. But I think want to make sure that we're not over promising and under delivering. So we've got, I think, a really sound forecast for where those units will be producing. And again.\nWe're challenging the team and they're challenging themselves to deliver more than that. And if I was a betting person, which I am, I would bet they'll do it.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Royall of JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, John.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nI was hoping for an update on your expectations around\nNorth American tariffs. Assuming those are implemented and assuming they're in place for a material amount of time, you have upstream and downstream assets\nin Canada, but also downstream assets in\nthe US that could be impacted. So how should we think about what that could mean for ExxonMobil overall?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, John. Thanks for the question. I'll tell you the way that we're looking. Obviously there's a lot of noise and speculation in this space and\nI would put it in the same category as we think about prices and where prices are going. At the end of the day, what we can control is how effective and efficient we are as operators, making sure that we're producing the highest value products for the kit that we have and efficiently getting it to market. And I think that's going to, at the end of the day, no matter where the market moves, there's a cost of supply curve.\nAll the work we've been doing over the last eight years has been to drive our production to the low end of the cost of supply curve so that we have a significant margin versus the, you know, the last marginal barrel of production that's required to meet the market demand. None of that's going to change with tariffs. That's all going to get shifted around.\nOur view is we're going to continue to be a very cost-competitive, low-cost supply source and therefore will continue to outperform competition. That's basically how we're looking at it as we kind of wade through the noise that's out there in the media and the press with respect to all the speculation around policy.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Betty Jiang of Barclays.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nGood morning. I want to ask about your data center strategy or enabling the expansion of AI in the US.\nCarbon capture CCS value chain is a key competitive advantage for Exxon. Are you seeing any interest in the market for the low carbon gas solutions versus just traditional gas power plants? How quickly do you think Exxon can bring these solutions to the market? And just given the recent news with DeepSeek, are you seeing any changing tune for your conversation with the end customers? Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, good morning, Betty. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think you hit on really what is the nexus of our strategy with respect to data centers, which is offering decarbonized power for data centers. We're not interested, as we mentioned in December, in going into a utility business like power generation. Utility returns for power generation would not compete in our portfolio. Leveraging the end-to-end system that we have for capturing, transporting, and storing CO2 is a huge advantage and brings a lot of value for hyperscalers who are looking to have decarbonized power and to manage their emissions.\nI would say that there continues to be a very strong desire for many of these customers to build data centers that are decarbonized. There is a lot of interest in that space. We're having a lot of continuing conversations.\nWe have sites that have been selected. We've got, you know, we've been doing the work to decarbonize our natural gas, which would be an important feed in a low carbon data center. Of course, we've got the work we've been doing with our partners around carbon capture and storage, and we've got the Green Line. We've got all the pieces today. We've been in early engineering for these centers, so we know exactly what it's going to take. We've got a very, as you know, large and successful project organization. This is right in their wheelhouse. We're acting as a bit of an integrator in the early days to accelerate the schedules, which is really important to many of the customers.\nOur view is we'll bring this on faster than anybody else in industry, and we'll certainly bring it on faster than any other opportunities for decarbonization. My guess would be, depending on how the discussions go with customers, that we could get a site up and going by 2028 and then have it decarbonized into 2029. I would say it's rough order how to think about that. We're well into the development phase. Obviously, a lot of dynamics here, a lot of moving parts and variables, in large part on the customer side. We're there, we're available. We want to make sure that we've got an offering that meets their needs, and when they're ready for them, we'll be ready.\nWith respect to DeepSeek, I would say that hasn't impacted the conversations to date that we're having with our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to Neil's earlier question on growth. There's a lot in the queue in the near term, beyond just Guyana. You highlighted 10 startups with over $3 billion of earnings, earnings that also hold the current margins. I appreciate that guidance. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the timing for some of the key projects driving that growth as we move through 2025, how they impact earnings through the year, and when you expect to get to that over $3 billion run rate. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure, Devin. Thanks for the question. I think you're right. It is a, it's going to be a busy year with a lot of startups. I may just kind of walk through the key projects that we've been talking with you all about and start with the China Chemical Complex. We mechanically completed that at the end of last year. We've been going through startup sequencing and making sure that each piece of that kit is working as designed, and we'll bring all that integrated together. My expectation is we'll get it started up here sometime in the first quarter. Back into the first quarter in Fawley, we're building.\nConversion facility to produce low sulfur diesel. My expectation is we'll have that in early Q2. We've got two advanced recycling units that we are building at Baytown. Despite the Attorney General's accusations that these are myths, we've actually got two more units starting up, one in the second quarter and one in the fourth quarter, which continues to have see a lot of interest by consumers for recycled product. That capacity is desperately needed to meet that customer demand. We've got all the modules that we need for the Strathcona renewable diesel. Looking to basically try to get that started up here in the second quarter.\nExpect that to happen. The other real big project that we've got is the Singapore Resid Upgrade Project. That is new to the world technology. Feel really good about the progress we've made there.\nWe've got all the vessels loaded with catalyst. Some of that catalyst is proprietary. It's the largest catalyst load we've ever done. We did that successfully and expect to be mechanically complete sometime here in the first quarter and get into the startup and sequencing, and expect to be up and running, kind of the back end of the second quarter, I would hope. Proxxima second quarter is when we expect to get some more capacity on, and then going forward in time, a lot more capacity coming on as we continue to work with customers and sell into what we think is some very attractive applications where there's really good demand.\nContinue to see good progress there, and that project's coming along.\nBacalhau. I expect sometime in 2025, probably closer to the third quarter. Yellowtail third quarter. As we said with Golden Pass, probably the back end of 2025, we expect to see first LNG and mechanically complete kind of around mid year is the time frame that we run through all of those. As we mentioned, on a constant price basis, which we provide for you guys to kind of see the underlying fundamentals of these projects, expect to see more than $3 billion of improved earnings once they're up and running full, which we're considering 2026. At the same time, you look at the current price margin environment that we're in, which is obviously pretty challenging.\nWe're still, as you rack up all those projects, still above $3 billion of earnings contributions.\nThat's, you know, frankly, the goal is to make sure that.\nThese projects are resilient to, you know, the bottom of the cycle conditions. Feel pretty good about that, portfolio projects, and where we are.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for all the detail.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, everybody. Thank you for having my questions. Thanks for all the details. Darren, I think you missed out your 25% of 10 years in your startup list, but who's counting?\nMy question specifically is about, I hate to be predictable, your cash distribution philosophy, buybacks versus dividends. I want to kind of position it like this. If I look at buybacks last year and the $20 billion commitment for the next two years, you could make a case that you're basically buying back the shares that you issued for Pioneer. I know it's not as cut and dried as that, but I'm curious, with the inflection in free cash flow that you clearly have, your capacity for dividend growth is substantially greater than the 4% bump that you gave to shareholders now for several years running. Are you waiting to buy in the Pioneer stock before you step up that dividend? Is my question.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nThat's really, Doug, coincidence, right, that we moved up our buyback pace in conjunction with Pioneer, obviously, because Pioneer was giving us incremental cash flow to be able to do that. That moved up our pace from $17.5 to 20 billion annually, and we've guided that. We expect to be at that pace for this year and next year, assuming continued reasonable market conditions. It is, I would say, just a coincidence that that $20 billion pace means that we'll essentially buy back the shares from Pioneer over a three-year period.\nIf we go to look at our philosophy overall in terms of the dividend, we have been clear that we look at that dividend, and we want it to be sustainable, we want it to be competitive, and we want it to be growing. We are always looking at it through that lens.\nThe share buyback program, as a secondary benefit, actually reduces the overall dividend in absolute terms as we continue to take shares out of the market. That's how we look at the dividend philosophy. As you know, we increase the annual dividend for 42 years running, which is a claim only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 can make. We are very focused on and understand the importance of that dividend for our shareholders. We also realize compared to other companies, you know, we have a quite large retail shareholder base that are very focused on the dividend. That's how we look at and evaluate things.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI appreciate the answer. I would just footnote that dividend growth per share seems to be the driver, or at least the mechanism, for market recognition of value. That is why we're so keen on this issue. I appreciate the answers. Thanks so much.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steve Richardson of Evercore ISI.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, good morning. I was wondering, Darren, now that we've had a little bit of time to sit with the corporate plan update and all the visibility you provided out till 2030, and maybe this is a beyond 2025 question, it seems to us that internal to Exxon, the biggest risk to hitting that return on capital employed target seems to be on the CapEx line. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about the forward look on CapEx upside, downside risks, any proportion that you think is indexed versus contractual.\nIt would just seem to us like a lot of the things you're doing the next couple of years are replication of things that you've already executed in the last number of years, Guyana, Permian, those types of things. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, thank you, Steve. Appreciate the question. As we talked about as part of the corporate plan.\nPresentation in December, if you look at the CapEx profile, a large portion of it is kind of dealing with, as you say, the things that we've already demonstrated we know how to do. Frankly, the CapEx that we're spending in that space is fairly flat as we continue to grow.\nVolumes and then the cash flow and earnings that go with it. As we're advancing, I'd say the upgrade of our existing portfolio to advantaged volumes, we're doing that with a fairly stable and flat CapEx profile, which we feel really good about. That reflects the continued efficiency that we're finding as we apply technologies. My expectation is as we go forward, we're learning a ton. Even as we bring in new technology and begin to apply it, we're learning on that technology and finding additional opportunities. I think we're on a really good trajectory with respect to continuing to grow advantaged volumes and continuing to drive capital efficiency.\nThat's what we've laid out as our best estimate now. Again, what I would say is I really like what we're finding as we deploy these technologies and see the improvements.\nOn top of that we've got.\nThe lower emissions spend that we've laid out and the new products that we're looking to new markets, new businesses that we're looking to establish with the Proxxima Resin System and the carbon material ventures, which again we see really, really high levels of interest from customers. We're continuing with working with them in trials and testing out the product. We feel good about what we're seeing there.\nThose investments, which is really the growth that you're seeing with our capital spend, are all conditioned on making sure that those products, the value proposition that we believe we have there, is realized and compensated and generate high returns for those investments. I'd say those are less, those are contingent. We feel today pretty confident that we will pursue those investments because of what we're seeing today.\nWe're not going to go ahead with them until we're convinced that the value is there and we'll realize that value in the investments and generate advantage returns. That's how we're thinking about it. Similar with the low carbon we've said before where we need policy support, that policy needs to be in place and we need to have customers who are signing up for the offtakes and that work continues. I'd say on top of the steady base that we've established here in 2024, all the additional CapEx will basically be conditioned on ensuring that we get good returns on that incremental investment in these new businesses and new opportunities. Anything to add, Kathy?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nThe other thing I would just say is we have a huge competitive advantage in our global projects organization. You're talking about, hey, one of the things as we look out and we think about continuing to improve your return on capital employed and the new projects that are coming online that gives us great confidence, and the fact that they continue, especially in our base business, to figure out how to get more and more efficient. Guyana would be a great example of that. Right. We get more and more learnings in terms of looking at those reservoirs and exactly what the kit is that we need in order to optimize production.\nI think it is a significant advantage for us. If you look at the biggest risks, I mean, what you spend in bringing a project online definitely has some risk associated with it.\nI think we have competitive advantage there. What you get out of the ground. Right. Understanding that I think is really critical. The Permian would be a great example of that. You know, the synergies we're driving in Pioneer, as we look at recovery rates, as we look at implementing new technology, like a different approach to proppant, I think those all give us really significant confidence in our ability to continue to improve overall capital returns. We have an advantaged set of projects. It puts us in a very differentiated position relative to other competitors.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America.\n\nJean Ann Salisbury\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning. You have two major LNG projects coming online and are a major seller of LNG already. You've also signed some contracts to buy LNG from third parties that may now, with the LNG permit ban being lifted, have a better chance of coming online later in the decade. Can you give more color on your LNG contracting strategy from here and how you see the LNG market in the medium term, oversupplied or not?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure, thanks for the question. I think as general context, I'd say as you look forward, we continue to see a really healthy demand and important role for LNG around the world. As we go out into the future, you see economies grow and people's standards of living improve.\nAs countries around the world look to decarbonize and back out coal, LNG is going to play a really important role. That broader theme we see continuing to play out well into the 2050 time frame. We think LNG is going to be an important product and continuing to find ways to bring on advantage. Supply of LNG is pretty critical to our strategy. As you know, the market today and these projects are underpinned by long-term sales contracts. We continue to.\nProgress those contracts in conjunction with the projects that we're developing. That continues to be the foundation for the LNG market. A majority of the production that we are looking to bring online will be underpinned by long-term contracts, which are linked to crude pricing. I think that really reflects the demand that you're seeing from customers out there, and the need for continued gas. There's a portion that we're leaving uncontracted to support the work that we're doing with our trading organization and growing that business.\nAs that market grows and becomes more liquid, we continue to see opportunities to optimize around that market and extract some additional value through trading. We're making sure that we've got volume available for that.\n\nJean Ann Salisbury\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nHead of Americas Energy and Transition Research, Bernstein Research\n\nGood morning. A bit of a follow up on the LNG theme, but more specifically around the FID cadence this year and next. You've got Papua LNG and PNG. You've got Rovuma and maybe even Coral North in Mozambique. Those are very different investments than adding another well in the Permian. What do you need to see in terms of maybe returns and certainty, and maybe even local situation, to give you the confidence to move forward on those multi-decadal assets?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. You're right that each of these projects are somewhat unique. What I would tell you is the constant here in terms of how we're evaluating and deciding to go forward is making sure that they're low cost of supply, so they're competitive supply sources in a market. That way, as we move forward, irrespective of how the market develops and the highs and the lows, we have an advantaged cost of supply vis a vis the rest of the supply curve and some of our competitors. That's a critical component. With that comes in an advantaged project and advantaged returns. That is fundamental to what we're looking at with each of these.\nYou know, as Kathy mentioned earlier in the call, the project organization that we had brings a huge advantage in this space to help us drive these projects to the left hand side of the cost of supply curve. I'd also add that our technology organization that we've established and the focus is that they're putting on and working with the project's organization is another advantage that helps kind of drive that to the left hand side of the cost of supply curve. I would say that the primary.\nVariables at play here, obviously we look at the stability of the area that we're in. We've got a really long history of managing that exposure and risk. We feel pretty good around what we're seeing in the local communities that we're looking at, and the steps that we can take to make sure that we can develop a long-term successful business there in a stable environment. I think, you know, that piece of it, while certainly something that we need to manage and be aware of, isn't impacting, isn't the largest variable with respect to how we think about moving forward on these projects.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nHead of Americas Energy and Transition Research, Bernstein Research\n\nVery clear. We should think 2025 for PNG and 2026 for Rovuma, still?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nWe're working towards the 2026 timeframe in the Rovuma and PNG. We're continuing to work through a target, hopefully have something near the back end of this year for FID.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nHead of Americas Energy and Transition Research, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Bob.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nResearch Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nMorning. Thanks for the time, Darren. My question is around your long-term plans. I believe you all have suggested about growing the earnings around $20 billion in cash flow by an additional $30 billion by 2030. I think that goes along with the US production, I think doubling or severely increasing. I'm just wondering in order to achieve this, what type of levels are you all assuming for, on broad strokes, for annual capital spend and OpEx during this period in order to achieve it? I'm just wondering directionally, what are you showing?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. I'll start with capital because we gave guidance at our corporate plan. You know, this coming year in 2025, we said we expect cash CapEx to be between $27 and 29 billion. Between 2026 and 2030, that number is $28 to 33 billion. If you just think about expenses, obviously we're growing, and we're growing across our business. That is going to have growth expense associated with it. Some of the offsets of that are driving significant structural cost reductions. To date since 2019, we're at a little over $12 billion in terms of structural cost reductions. We said between here and 2030, we expect to get that number up to $18 billion.\nKind of an additional $6 billion in structural cost savings to help to offset just the cost of that growth overall, and obviously a little bit of inflation. The last thing I would say on that topic is we have a global procurement organization, as we talked about the global projects organization, working pretty hard to make sure that we're bringing kind of the full scale, and the manner in which we integrate our business, kind of to bear as we procure the different products and services that we procure. They're doing quite a good job, you know, as they look to help us hold down expenses.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, maybe just to build on Kathy's point, if you look at where we were in 2019, we challenged the organization to pay for the growth, to make sure that as we were growing and adding some of those additional expenses associated with new facilities, new production, that we offset that through our structural cost reductions. If you look at where we were in 2019 and where we ended 2024, not only have we offset all the additional cost of the growth, we offset all the inflation and had a further reduction of about $1.5 billion. I think we've demonstrated the ability to both grow the business and grow the value while reducing costs.\nI think that is a very unique challenge, and I think a great testament to the work that this organization has been doing to create value out there.\nThe only other point I would make is not only do we have really solid plans to 2030, the new markets and new businesses that we're starting don't really start to move the needle until we're beyond that 2030 time frame. What I'm excited about is not only the fidelity that we have in terms of how we get to 2030 and that 2030 objective that we've talked about, but also that we've established a foundation that gives us a platform for growing well into the future in markets that are decoupled from the commodity price cycle. That's pretty exciting for our company.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nResearch Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nWell said. Thanks, Darren. Thanks, Kathy.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Neal.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, good morning. Maybe to take a slightly different tack here on some of the policy changes like you mentioned at the beginning of the call, Darren, some favorable changes. One of the other ones that's percolating a little bit in the executive order was for the EPA to take a look at the endangerment finding on CO2. I know there's a lot of ways CO2 is approached in terms of, you know, what's in the IRA and stuff, but if we were to see a change in federal government regulations on CO2, how do you think about that affecting some of the decisions you're making on the renewable and low carbon investment approaches here?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, good morning, Roger. Thanks for the question. Let me just start with the fundamentals of how we think about this stuff, because our work and the Low Carbon Solutions business is reflective of not any specific policy that's existing. In fact, we put that business together and started working on it well in advance of the IRA and some of the policy that the Biden administration brought forward. We focused instead on what we recognize as a need to continue to supply the energy sources and products that the world desperately needs to grow, and for people's prosperity to improve, but at the same time reduce emissions.\nI would say as a company, we recognize the need for society to reduce emissions in a thoughtful, constructive way.\nWhat we're trying to do is offer up a skill set and a capability set that can help accomplish that. That's the long-term objective here. Putting in place the foundations for an approach that makes sense, that leverages our key competitive advantages, and affordably reduces emissions while we continue to meet the needs for our products is part of the strategy. Frankly, we're demonstrating the ability to do that, to pay for it, and to generate returns at the same time. This and equation is, we believe, a real thing and that people should be focused on doing it all. That's what we're trying to do. I would say that's the foundation. That's how we think about it.\nWe recognize the demand for the reduction, and the intensity of the focus on that may vary as you move across different political regimes and move around the world, and will move up and down with time. The fundamentals, we believe, are there, and that's what we're focused on, is the long term game here and making sure that what we bring forward in terms of a solution is cost.\nEfficient and very effective. That's how we're looking at it. Frankly, from what we've seen so far, I think we've got an advantage with respect to where we're at in looking at those opportunities. We've got an advantage with our capabilities and with the facilities that we've brought on so far and the ones that we're developing. We feel good about that.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nThe only thing I would add is obviously the new administration is focused on trying to streamline regulation, right. Looking at how that can open things up for business. You know, when we look at just as an example, you know, looking to permanently sequester CO2, you know, getting that permitting has been a long process. You know, it's just one area of many that you can look at across the industry to say, hey, what things can be done to ease regulation so that business can get done more quickly, projects can get put in place more quickly. We look forward to continuing to discuss those things with the new administration.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThe good news, Roger, is we've got flexibility here, so we can adjust as we move forward and respond to some of the changes that we see.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate that. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nYou guys clearly have an expertise in the deepwater in your success, whether say two decades ago in Angola or recently in Guyana. One deepwater area that you are noticeably missing is Gulf of Mexico. You really, relative to the size of the company, you are really small. Trying to understand that, is it because when you guys are looking at that, you do not like the cost structure there, or you do not like the regulatory environment, or you do not like the geologies and such. With the new administration, the approach there, is that going to change the way that you look at that basin?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Paul. Thanks for the question. You're right that in terms of as you look around the world, our presence in the Gulf of Mexico is.\nMore limited. I would just tell you it's a function of evaluating the opportunities there and the cost association, supply. You touched on a couple of the factors. One is the cost of supply and the cost to develop there in the Gulf of Mexico. You talked about the geology. The geology is tough as well, which obviously impacts the cost. We look at all those factors. We are continuing to evaluate opportunities. If the Trump administration opens up new areas for exploration, we will be in there with the rest of industry evaluating to see if we think there's an opportunity to cost effectively develop those resources. I'll come back to. And so.\nThat's the lens we put across all of the opportunities. The Gulf of Mexico is no better off or no worse off than anything else that we're looking at. It's really the criteria of cost effective.\nSupply being on the low end of the cost of supply curve, making sure that we can develop those in an advantaged way that then brings advantaged returns into the portfolio. That's the criteria that we're using. If we find something in the Gulf of Mexico that we convince ourselves will allow us to do that, we'll develop it. If we don't, we'll continue to find and look for those opportunities in other parts of the world. We're pretty agnostic with respect to location, much more focused on the characteristics and the ability to develop advantaged barrels.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood, thanks. Maybe one on carbon capture. You have four decent-sized projects set to start up over the next 24 months on your list. I know in the past you've talked about some of the challenges of effectively creating a new industry that doesn't currently exist, particularly on the commercial side. Can you maybe give some color as to how the commercial side of that business has evolved? What challenges remain, including maybe on the regulatory support side.\nWhat contribution do you expect to see over the next couple years out of the CCS business?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks, Ryan. I think a lot has happened in this space over time, and I think probably the most important development is there's been a real shakeout between people who are out there talking about a carbon capture and storage business and people who are actually capable of doing it. That has, I think, created a lot more clarity, particularly from a customer standpoint, in terms of where they need to go to find companies that can deliver on this. We are, as you mentioned, uniquely positioned here. We've got the only, the world's only end-to-end capture, transport, and storage system. That puts us in a unique position.\nTo work with customers to help them decarbonize. I think those conversations continue to happen. There is a continued interest. We've got a fairly healthy sales pipeline that we're working with customers on.\nI like how that's developed. I like our position. We continue to do a lot of work around that system that we've built, making sure that unlike a lot of companies in this space that are limited to a single site, we've got a system. We're developing that system so that we've got a lot of optionality and can take advantage of storage sites all along that pipeline. We feel good about having a very robust system that we can then ensure customers that when we commit to capture their CO2 and store it, we can effectively do that and manage any of the variables that kind of come along the pike.\nThat's how we're looking at it. We've got pretty aggressive growth plans in this space, but again, all dependent upon customer interest and customers' willingness to engage in long-term contracts.\nThat's what we're continuing to work on. Like I said, a lot of interest in this space given our unique abilities.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, what we said back at the corporate plan is when we look at our low carbon solutions business in its entirety, right, so obviously the CCS opportunities you just talked about, but hydrogen, lithium, everything all together, you know we would see $2 billion in earnings growth kind of between now and 2030. Obviously, that will come as we pick up momentum and start to implement the projects that we've been talking about.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Biraj Borkhataria of Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head Energy Transition Research, Royal Bank of Canada\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get some perspective on the chemicals market. You show a helpful slide every quarter on the margins related to a 10-year average. Obviously, the chems margin has been well below that very consistently. Do you see any signs of green shoots in that space, either regionally or product wise, that you can talk about? As a quick follow-on to that, separately, are you able to disclose your reserve replacement ratio for the year, both total and organic?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Biraj. I'll start with that and see if Kathy has anything she wants to add. The margins that we show in the markers that we show are kind of an industry perspective with respect to the distribution of the chemical business globally around the world, and the average margin that you see there, we're advantaged versus that with respect to our facilities. As you look across the world, I'd say the most advantaged.\nRegion today is North America where, as you know, we've got a fairly large footprint. We've been, despite, I'd say, very challenging conditions. I think we've been well positioned there, and very.\nProud of the work that our folks in the chemical business have been doing to optimize and make sure that in this environment, they continue to deliver earnings.\nThe demand in chemicals is actually very strong, record levels of demand. The challenge has obviously been in the supply side of the equation. I think in terms of a green shoot comment, how do you balance supply and demand? I mean it's every.\nFacility out there has to kind of figure out where they're at in the cost of supply and whether they can survive or not. I think you're seeing more and more companies that are disadvantaged with respect to their facilities evaluate their business and ability to be successful in the kind of market that we're in. The way I look at this at a macro level, these cycles are necessary. We've got to go through the lows to make sure that the industry continues to focus on efficiency, effectiveness, and continuing the high grading of the broader overall industry portfolio.\nOur job obviously is to make sure that our facilities are on the high end of that high grading, and we feel really good about where we've been there. I think that's going to continue to happen.\nI think from my perspective, this challenge here is not unlike the challenges we've seen in the past, and frankly very much in line with our philosophy of you build this business to be successful, successful in the bottom of the cycle, and then you take the gravy that comes with the top of the cycle. We feel good about our ability to be successful even in these bottom of the cycle conditions. Kathy, anything to add?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nThe only thing I'd add is if you look at the projects we're bringing online, you know, those will continue to help us to be advantaged, whether it's the China 1 Chemical Complex that's coming online, which is really focused on performance chemicals. Right, the upgrade we're doing overall in our Singapore facility, kind of bridged upgrade on the margin helps us, and then obviously bringing on more circular.\nPlastics basically helps us in terms of advanced recycling. All the projects we have will continue to, well, position the company. We've been very focused on ensuring that we're a low cost supplier, which makes us resilient even in these difficult market conditions.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThanks, Biraj.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head Energy Transition Research, Royal Bank of Canada\n\nThanks. Anything on the reserve replacement ratio?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nNo, we don't really consider that to be particularly informative of where the company is going.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head Energy Transition Research, Royal Bank of Canada\n\nOkay, understood.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Jason Gabelman from TD Cowen.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director and Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHey. Morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask a question on slide six where you lay out all the projects. You know, Doug alluded to it earlier, it seems like you're missing a couple of projects that are starting up here. TCO, the Permian pipeline project. We would have thought the overall potential earnings number from all the projects combined are closer to $5 billion, including those two projects. First, is that correct? Second, is there any major difference you see between the earnings contribution of these projects and the cash flow contribution? Thanks.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I'm happy to take that. We tended to focus here on the projects where we're the operator as opposed to, you know, TCO, where we're not the operator. Obviously, we will get some benefit from that. We did not focus on projects that were not the operator. We also focused on projects that are newly starting up as opposed to, you know, projects like the Permian crude venture that is already underway. I would say yes, we clearly continue to get incremental benefits from the projects that are already underway that the company started up pre 2025.\nObviously, to the extent that we're participating in an arrangement where somebody else is the operator and projects are starting up, we will get the benefits from those things.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nI would add in terms of those other projects that you referenced, obviously they're baked into our plans, and the volumes that we shared as part of the corporate plan outlook includes all elements of the projects that are coming on.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director and Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nAny difference between earnings and cash flow contribution from these projects? Any major difference?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nNo.\nAll I would say is typically on projects generally there's a little bit of a lag on earnings relative to cash flow.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director and Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nAll right, Jason, thanks. Thanks everybody for joining this call and for your questions. We'll post the transcript of this call to the investors section of our website early next week, and have a nice weekend. That concludes today's call."

We are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation second quarter 2024 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Chapman. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nTreasurer and VP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter 2024 earnings call. We appreciate your joining us. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investor section of our website. They are meant to accompany the second quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location.\nDuring today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussions of our long-term plans and integration efforts, which are still being developed and which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide two. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the website. Now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's performance remains strong. In the second quarter, we delivered earnings of $9.2 billion, our second-best second quarter results in the last 10 years. Just as important, we continue to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company, as Kathy covers in her prepared remarks available on our website.\nWhile overall market conditions were softer in Q2, oil prices remained firm. As a reminder, at Brent between $60 and $80 a barrel, real and 10-year average refinery and chemical margins, we expect to generate between $80 and $140 billion in cumulative surplus cash from 2024 to 2027. The Pioneer acquisition increases that even further. In Q2, we once again set production records from our advantage assets in Guyana and the Permian. Including Pioneer, our Permian production surged to 1.2 million barrels per day. In Product Solutions, our sales of high-return performance products rose 5% sequentially to a new record. Our strong performance in Q2 continues to support our capital allocation priorities, including the distribution of $9.5 billion to shareholders, of which $4.3 billion was in dividends.\nWith the close of the Pioneer transaction, our shareholders now include the former owners of Pioneer stock, who have begun to benefit from the strength of our combined companies. We welcome them to ExxonMobil, just as we do the talented people of Pioneer, who bring a strong entrepreneurial mindset and deep expertise in unconventional resource development. I also want to recognize the combined transaction team for their excellence in execution. The average time to complete this type of merger over the last several years has been more than 11 months. We closed Pioneer in six, once again demonstrating the strength of our organization in effectively executing large, complicated projects, including large acquisitions. It is challenging work, requiring deep thinking, a highly structured approach, and disciplined action, areas where we excel.\nAlthough it's still early days, the integration is exceeding our expectations, and I'm confident we'll deliver even more synergies than we've announced. The team looks forward to sharing these details and all the other work we're doing to significantly grow value at our corporate plan update and upstream spotlight in December. As we look ahead, we see opportunities to grow value not only through our corporate plan period but long into the future. Later this month, we'll publish our global outlook, which projects global energy demand 15% higher in 2050 than it is today. We see oil demand holding steady at around 100 million barrels per day in 2050, while demand for renewables and natural gas grows considerably. An energy-abundant future, driven by economic growth and rising levels of prosperity, creates opportunity for ExxonMobil, no matter the speed or direction of the energy transition.\nOver time, as it becomes more and more obvious that heavy industry and commercial transportation will not be meaningfully powered by renewables, the world will come to rely more on technologies where we have an advantage, including hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. A serious approach to the transition should focus on moving the world from high carbon to low carbon energy, not simply from oil and gas to wind and solar. The data, science, and economics all support this as fundamentally necessary. Our strategy reflects this reality, and since it relies on the same corporate capabilities and advantages under any scenario, it is extremely flexible, delivering strong profitability irrespective of the path society takes. As a technology company that transforms molecules to meet society's needs, we're not defined by our existing product suite. We began as a maker of kerosene for lamps.\nToday, no one thinks of ExxonMobil as a kerosene company serving the lamp industry. In the future, ExxonMobil will be defined by the technologies and products it is producing to meet the world's future needs, as always, by drawing on our unique combination of competitive advantages. We shared with you a variety of technologies and products we're developing to more effectively meet existing needs while helping the world achieve a lower carbon future. Two examples where I see significant new market potential are Proxima and carbon materials. With Proxima, we transform lower-value gasoline molecules into a high-performance, high-value thermoset resin that can be used in coatings, lightweight construction materials, and advanced composites for cars and trucks, including battery boxes for electric vehicles. Materials made with Proxima are lighter, stronger, more durable, and produced with significantly fewer GHG emissions than traditional alternatives.\nIn March, we showcased the automotive uses of Proxima at the world's leading international composite exhibition in Paris. We're progressing projects in Texas with startups planned in 2025 that will significantly expand our production of Proxima. We see the total addressable market for Proxima at 5 million tons and $30 billion by 2030, with demand growing faster than GDP and returns above 15%. That's an exciting new business opportunity with significant profit potential, where we have unique and hard-to-replicate advantages consistent with our strategy and core capabilities. We also see a sizable opportunity in carbon materials, transforming the molecular structure of low-value, carbon-rich feeds from our refining processes into high-value products for a range of applications. We're targeting market segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates outpacing GDP. These include carbon fiber, polymer additives, and battery materials.\nOur competitive advantages of scale, technology, and integration, combined with our North American manufacturing footprint, provide the foundation for building these compelling, new, high-margin businesses. I've challenged the Product Solutions team to lean into those opportunities and develop plans to accelerate the growth of both of these profitable new businesses. I hope we can ramp up investments to make them a meaningful part of our overall portfolio sooner, which will help further diversify earnings and significantly grow shareholder value for decades to come. ExxonMobil has a long history of successfully establishing new, high-value and used products for established and growing markets. Consider Vistamaxx, which we launched to enhance the performance of everything from auto parts and construction materials to personal care products and packaging.\nWe've grown our Vistamaxx performance polymer from five grades to 20, and total annual production capacity is 700,000 metric tons per annum, with highly attractive returns and significantly more growth potential. Of course, consistent with the track record we've established over the last seven years, the hurdle for investing will be high. Any investment will have to generate competitive returns, possess clear competitive advantages, and be resilient to the bottom of any commodity cycle. As we've demonstrated, our capital allocation decisions have generated robust earnings, cash flow, and shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities in December. In closing, we have a lot to feel good about. Our performance is strong. Our merger with Pioneer is already creating tremendous value, with more to come.\nAnd we continue to develop products and build businesses that will enable us to grow profitably far into the future across a wide range of scenarios, including a rapid energy transition. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nTreasurer and VP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that, Operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your telephone. The first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, Darren and team, and thanks for the update. I want to build on your comments on Pioneer.\nNow that it's under your umbrella, can you build on some of your comments around one, how is the asset performing from a volume and type curve perspective relative to expectations? And two, you alluded to synergies tracking ahead of expectations. Can you help delineate what those buckets of outperformance are?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Neil. I'll start with a few comments and then let Kathy kind of add on top of that. I would say early days, yet two months in, but the work of the team prior to the change in control and then what we've seen since then is extremely encouraging. As we've stated, the Pioneer assets basically delivered a record performance in the second quarter.\nIf you think about the context of doing that with all the change that was going on with respect to the merger, I think a real testament to the quality of the people there and the work that they've been doing. So I'd say vectors are all pointing up. I think probably better than what we had anticipated, but I would also say it's early in the process. The teams today are working very well together, which has led to, frankly, identifying a lot more value opportunities than, frankly, I think either of us could see when we were on opposite sides of the fence.\nNow that we're together working, we see essentially a lot of opportunities to transfer the best practices of ExxonMobil into Pioneer and likewise to transfer a number of best practices from Pioneer into the ExxonMobil base, which, when you think about our size, has some tremendous leverage associated with it. So that's all being worked through in detail. As you know, when we commit to some of our objectives, they're based by some very detailed plans that sit behind them. The organization today is working those plans, but we already see significant upside potential, not only in the magnitude but in the pace at which we'll be able to deliver them. I think a really positive story there. I'll let Kathy maybe add some additional details. Kathy?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure.\nI think one of the things we've been really pleased by is the number of learnings that we've already had from Pioneer. And so not only will we bring our technology and cube development to them, but they're bringing a bunch of learnings to us. So we're already utilizing their remote logistics operations center and our own drilling and completions operations in order to improve supply chain. They've done some things on the procurement side, I'd say, that we think can help us to kind of leverage up our expertise. They've been really good over the years of blocking up their acreage. So we think that's another thing that ultimately we can benefit from. And then, as I think everyone knows, they've got a quite large water infrastructure in the Midland Basin and will be looking to also leverage that.\nSo we've been really pleased with what they bring to the table, and we're off to a really good start as we look at building an integration development plan with them that fully utilizes the technology that we bring to the table. So we're going to have a corporate plan update in December. We're going to do a spotlight on the upstream, and we'll update where we're at with the synergies and how we're looking forward at that time.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I guess, cap it off, Neil, with what we said at the time we announced the acquisition that we were going to produce more barrels at a lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly way. That continues to be the case. That's obviously good for our company. But more importantly, as we said at the time, and we continue to emphasize, it's good for the US.\nIt's good for the US economy. It's good for the people living in the US. It's good for US businesses. And critically, it's good for US energy security. So I think this is, as I said at the time, going to be a win-win proposition for all.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you, Darren. Thank you, Kathy.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Betty Jiang with Barclays.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nDarren and Kathy, good morning. Since we just talked about Permian, we'll hit on the other region that's also hitting record production. So Guyana volumes continue to exceed expectations, and the FPSOs just continue to produce well above capacity. We'd love to just get an understanding of, do you think this type of performance is likely to continue? And is that translatable for what you would expect for the future projects that's yet to come?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. I'll take that, Betty. Thank you and good morning.\nGood to hear from you again. I would say what you're seeing is the collective effort of our organization focusing on what is a very high-value development and making sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities we can find to safely grow production. As you commented, we're seeing some significant improvements with production rates well above what we had based the investment decision on. That's continuing across all three of them. We try to take that into account as we develop the next. So in theory, you would think we build that into the base and don't continue to see that.\nBut frankly, our experience is telling us otherwise, which is this organization, complemented by the work that we're doing with our technology organization, our global operations and sustainability organization, and every element of the organization that we have now created and functionalized, is very focused on maximizing values. And so with these new organizations and that focus, they continue to find additional opportunities. So I would bet that we'll continue to see outperformance versus the basis on which we FID. But I would also tell you that every development is unique unto itself. And obviously, we got to get it up and running and then let the teams get after it and find the opportunities to safely increase its capacity. But I would just tell you, I would bet on our people to find that.\nWe've got a long history of doing it, and it's clearly demonstrating itself with this unique and valuable opportunity here.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Betty.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, Darren and Kathy. Good morning.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nStill getting used to the new moniker, Darren, but thanks for having me on. So I wonder if I could ask a question about portfolio now that you've got Pioneer in the door. You've got a lot of things that are perhaps you could characterize as maybe non-core, a lot of tails in the portfolio. And I'm just curious. We haven't really heard much on the asset disposal front in a while.\nI'm curious if now that you've got two very significant concentrated assets to a certain extent, the Permian and Guyana, what it means for the portfolio in terms of high-grading opportunities going forward.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I'll start with that, and then I'll let Kathy add anything that she wants to. But I would say, actually, we've been fairly aggressively going after the tail. Remember, I think back in 2019, we had announced that we were going to divest about $15 billion over time. Of course, we got into the pandemic, and we said, \"We're not going to. This is not a forced march. We're going to basically divest when the market conditions ensure that we can realize the value that we think the assets that we are marketing can be realized.\" And frankly, that's what we've been doing.\nSo as you look at where we're at to date, Q2 this year, I think we've basically gotten to the $15 billion in the upstream. And then if you look at what we've been doing in the downstream, there's another few billion dollars that we've added on top of that. So frankly, from a cleaning up the tail standpoint, we've made significant progress. Obviously, there's a few more things that we're working on, and we'll continue to assess every one of the assets in the portfolio and make sure that they are competitively advantaged. And frankly, as we look at new investments, we force those investments to compete on an industry-wide basis and make sure that they're advantaged versus the industry and therefore can be supply product at low cost to supply. We also do that with all of our existing assets.\nIf they're not competitively positioned on an industry supply curve, then the organization has two options. Either we come up with an advantaged investment that makes them more competitive and moves them to the left on the cost of supply curve, or we look to divest. That process has been ongoing across all of our businesses. Then obviously, the timing of when we then take action is a function of realizing the value that we think those divestments should bring. We're patient. We're not going to rush that process. I would just say staying after it, being very steady, waiting for the market to meet to be where it needs to be in order for us to reevaluate has paid off significantly. Basically, we're delivering on what we said we were going to do, and we'll continue to look at it.\nBut I don't see any big step changes here in the medium term.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nAnd the only other thing I'd note, Neil, is you can see in our cash flow bridges every quarter.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nDoug.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nDoug. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Doug. I'm sorry. But you can see in our cash flow bridges, we're pretty consistently every quarter bringing in more proceeds from the divestments that are occurring. In the first half of the year, that was $1.6 billion. And then I would just note we had a lot of activity in upstream. And so that generated some positive earnings for us in the quarter. And so if you look at my prepared remarks that we published earlier this morning, I talk about sort of $380 million in the upstream being kind of these other one-off items.\nThat was a lot of earnings coming in from divestments, only partially offset by the one-off costs associated with Pioneer.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nTerrific. It would have been worse if you'd called me Jennifer or Kathy, but thanks so much. I appreciate it.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good. Appreciate that. Sorry about that, Doug.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nTreasurer and VP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nDoug, congratulations on the new shop, the new platform.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd to you, Jim. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Just taking my question. So Darren, you had a lot of good updates in your prepared remarks on some of the low-carbon initiatives. And there's been a lot of progress there, it seems, over the past few months and quarters, which is great to see.\nNow, I think back to the corporate plan you laid out late last year. This is a growing wedge of your overall capital spending in each of the next few years. So I was wondering if there's some of the investment opportunities to say more about what milestones you're focused on to actually allocate more capital to these areas. So what's needed to make final investment decision on the carbon viability or move forward with carbon materials or build the scale you talked about in lithium production? Is it more commercialization and offtake, technology development, regulatory clarity, something else?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. Yeah. You broke up just a little bit on that, Devin, but I think I got the gist of your question. If I don't hit the mark, then please steer me in a slightly different direction. Okay.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nSorry about that.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nI think your question around what's required to kind of continue to move along in our investments in the low-carbon solution across the portfolio of products that we've been talking about. I would just say fundamentally, we expect in the low-carbon businesses, and in fact, some of these new products that while they contribute to a lower carbon future, they also bring significant value in use in today's application. They have to compete in the portfolio. They have to be advantaged versus what's out there today. And they have to basically generate good returns across the commodity cycles. And so the fundamental philosophy that we've been applying in the base business also is required in the new businesses that we're trying to generate.\nSo that's foundational to what each of, and Dan Ammann in particular, but then the stuff that's coming out of the product solutions organization has also got to meet that initial hurdle. And then as you look across each of them, the hurdles to deliver on that expectation vary a little bit. I would say in Dan's business with the carbon capture and storage, he and his team are building a brand new business. And so there are very few, I think, examples of where the company is not only developing the technology and the infrastructure and logistics system, but also developing the capacity to supply while developing the demand and developing the market in general and advocating on what I would say are the initial policies needed to get things kick-started. So there are a lot of moving parts.\nI would say the broader industry and business community, frankly, haven't gotten far enough along in this to truly appreciate just how complicated it is. But I would say, leveraging the capacity and capability that we've built over the decades doing this in other parts of our company, particularly in the upstream, that we're leveraging those capabilities and making really good progress there. On the blue hydrogen project, as we've worked through the engineering, we've got a really good line of sight to what that project can deliver. Obviously, a critical element of that is getting the IRA legislation translated into final regulations. And that's a process that's been ongoing. We're optimistic that the regulations will reflect the intent of the legislation. And if it does, I think we'll have a very attractive project that we can then FID here once those regulations are finalized.\nSo I'm optimistic in that space. As you may have seen, we've just added another 500,000 tons of carbon capture and storage into Dan's portfolio. There's a pipeline that the team continues to work. We see continued opportunity and growth with good returns in the carbon capture side of the equation. On the lithium, same thing. While lithium is an established market, it's fairly small with respect to what its ultimate potential is. Of course, we're bringing on a new production method with some new technology. So again, doing the work to understand what the investments required there are and to establish and ensure that we've got a real advantage versus what else is out there and what else needs to come on to meet the growing demand in lithium. But again, I feel good about that.\nWe've told the team, \"We're not looking to rush this through and get money spent. We're looking to make sure that we build a very strong long-term foundation.\" So none of the work that we're doing in these new businesses is schedule-driven. It's all about establishing successful long-term foundations. And then maybe just briefly touch on Proxima and the carbon ventures, which that's a broader effort that we've been on for quite some time, which is to say leverage our technical capabilities to transform molecules and apply that to markets that exist with unmet needs. And I think we're making really good progress with Proxima. We've got some, I think, very high barriers to entry and competitive advantages there. And so I'm anxious to kind of prosecute that business and establish it as quickly as we can because we see real potential there. And same with carbon ventures.\nAgain, leveraging our ability to transform the molecules, shape the molecules, and get some structures that improve performance. I think there's a big opportunity there. But I would say carbon ventures is still early in the technology cycle, but I think we've gone far enough along to see some real opportunity there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the challenge I've given the product solutions organization is what's a realistic but aggressive business plan look like, and what would be the investment required to establish that? And that's good because it grows value today, but it also positions us well as those molecules become less demanded in their traditional applications. It becomes a much lower feedstock to these new applications. And so there's a lot of opportunity to diversify this late, protect the business, or diversify the business as we move through the transition.\nSo, long answer, but a lot of variables at play here, but frankly, all variables that we feel very comfortable managing. And I think the progress we're making there demonstrates our capability to manage those things.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Darren. Appreciate all the detail.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Royall with J.P. Morgan\n\nJohn Royall\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question's on the CapEx guidance update. We see that you moved the legacy CapEx up to the top end of the prior range. And then obviously, you layered in Pioneer as well. But can you talk about the drivers of the legacy CapEx bumping up to $25 billion for the year?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, John. I'll start with that and then let Kathy finish up.\nBut so the reason we put a range out on the CapEx is, as we build these plans in the previous year, starting around this time in the summertime, and then kind of lock and load them in October. And obviously, there's a lot of things that develop and evolve from the middle of the previous year to as we go into this year. That range is not meant to have you guys slice it down the middle and fix on a number. The range is to say we've got optionality here. And as things evolve, we may reduce some of the spending. Or if we find that the opportunities are panning out the way we expect, we may be on the other end. So that range is truly where we expect to be somewhere in, depending on how things evolve and what the opportunity set looks like.\nI mean, the key focus here is to make sure that we are investing in highly advantaged, highly profitable projects. Basically, as we've worked our way from October of last year into this year, we see a lot of attractive opportunities that we continue to invest in, which puts us at the top end of that, consistent with what we understood the opportunity set could look like as we went into the plan process last year. That's why we're coming in at 2025. Then, of course, we're using the Pioneer number to add on top of that. But Kathy, anything to add to that?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nNo, I would just say, obviously, we have a lot of projects coming online in 2025 in the exact pace of all of those.\nAnd therefore, making sure that we provide it sort of enough room, I would say, in the initial guidance supporting all of those projects that are coming online in 2025. We can't pinpoint, predict all of that as we put our plans together for the year. And so just as an example, China 1 is a huge project. It's going to be coming online early next year as an example. So there's always a little bit of give and take, which is why we give the range to start with.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually wanted to follow up on the 2025 project startups that you just mentioned. And thanks for a little bit more detail on the China Chemicals Complex.\nBut as I look to the other projects coming online, I think the largest earnings contributors include the Permian Crude Pipeline, and then in the upstream, Golden Pass, and then the next, Guyana block. So I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those projects in terms of how they're progressing and kind of phasing through the year. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSo I would say, consistent with the plans that we put out, the projects are all, with obviously the exception of Golden Pass, moving consistent with the plan development and the announced dates that we talked about. All of them, I think, we feel really good about in terms of the work that we're doing and the case for the contributions, the returns, the earnings that we expect to get out of those projects. I think we continue to feel good about.\nUnderpinning all the projects is we never try to take a position on where we're going to be in the market cycle, but instead make sure that these projects, when they come on, can compete in any of the areas of the cycle. We've actually found that if you look at the investments we've made since 2018, brought online, if you look at the aggregate return of that portfolio, it's exceeding the basis in which we FID those projects, even as we've been, say, in the chemical business at bottom of cycle conditions. I think we continue to demonstrate to ourselves the time we spend to make sure these projects are advantaged in the base case is paying off.\nAnd then, of course, our global project organization is really continuing to drive very effective execution of the portfolio with keeping our cost well within the FID basis and generally delivering it faster and therefore bringing more value sooner. Kathy, anything?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I would just note it's an especially big year for our EMPS business. So I already noted China 1. You noted a couple of projects. I mean, the Singapore Resid upgrade project is a pretty big project. We have an upgrade project at Fawley in order to bring on ultra-low sulfur diesel. We've got the Strathcona project for renewable diesel coming online in 2025. So really big year for the EMPS business in terms of the number of projects we have coming online. And then we're going to continue to expand our advanced recycling. So we'll be adding more capacity as well next year.\nSo we noted, again, if you look at our IR slides, we talk about projects being a big driver of underlying earnings growth in the EMPS business. And you see that supported by everything coming on in 2025.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nHi there. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Jason's question and more specifically on Golden Pass. So I guess at this point, are you able to confirm updated schedule guidance for the startup? And then the second question is just going to some of your prepared remarks. If I think about your upstream portfolio, a lot of your growth is liquids or liquids price linked through LNG. I think you say 80% of your upstream is now linked to liquids.\nSo I was thinking, as you're building out your LNG portfolio and your trading function, is there any desire to diversify that sales mix a bit more, or is this intentional and where you want to be? Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. I'll start with the last part of the question, which is, it is a conscious decision to get weighted on liquid prices. And frankly, if you look at the LNG market, and when you're building large LNG projects, you tend to sell those out and sign contracts in advance of the investments, which the market today is linked to oil. And so we continue to have a desire to lock in a significant portion of those developments so that we've got surety on the sales side of the equation as we bring those projects up. So my expectation is we'll continue to be weighted on that.\nAnd we're very comfortable with that. In fact, there's been a huge drive since I've been in this job and brought Neil into the upstream to basically shift the portfolio and get a little heavier weighting in the oil side. As I mentioned this morning on CNBC, if you look at the oil that we're producing today, we're producing more oil than at any time since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. That strategy is beginning to manifest itself. On your Golden Pass project, so we've just gotten through the venture, just reached a settlement with Zachry. So that venture is in the process of kind of restaffing and getting started back up again. Obviously, we're in the very early days of that. There's still more work to be done.\nOf course, the teams are very focused on getting back to work, effectively executing, and bringing that project in as quickly as they can and as close to the original schedule as they can. Right now, our estimate is we're going to see about a six-month slippage. So we had anticipated kind of first LNG the middle of next year. We now are looking at probably the back end of 2025 for first LNG. And that's kind of where the current schedule is. But I would just condition that with the teams are just getting back up and running. And they have a clear mandate to try to bring that in as effectively as they can. And again, my expectation is they'll do better than we currently think, but we've got work to do.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Biraj.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nHi. Thank you. I was wondering if we could circle back. I appreciate all the conversation about projects and project execution, and how you've got a number of really important and interesting projects coming on in the downstream in short order. I'm just wondering, you've added seemingly quite a bit of length to your upstream portfolio over the last number of years. And as you think out beyond 2026, 2027, Darren, are the teams continuing to bring you new and interesting projects in EMPS? And do you think continuing that kind of pace of integration out in the plan horizon is still interesting? Maybe you could just talk about that in terms of the investment mix and the opportunities, and maybe address EMPS and chemicals as well.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure.\nNo, I appreciate the question, Steve, because I think you're touching on a really important point. I think one of the advantages of the restructuring that we've done is we no longer identify our business with the products that we're making. If you go back in time, the functional organizations that we established, we had a refining organization that was producing refining products. We had a fuels marketing organization that was marketing fuels. We had a chemical company that was marketing chemicals. We've now combined all that into a product solutions organization, which is supported by a technology organization, which, again, is not organized around any of our heritage businesses or heritage products, but instead is organized around core capabilities, core technical capabilities to deliver value to the businesses that they support.\nSo while it may not be intuitively obvious, that change in structure and the way we think about and talk about the business has also opened up a lot of white space in terms of the challenge here is how do we take our core advantages, core capabilities. Some of it includes our existing footprint, but a lot of it includes our ability to upsell and to identify value and use applications and combine that with a technology organization that's very focused on applying core technology capabilities to business challenges and business opportunities, which is starting to unlock applications that, frankly, in the past wouldn't have been identified because they didn't fit in the context of the organizations that we had in place. But today, the aperture is much broader, and the playing field is much bigger. And so we see that with Proxima and Carbon Ventures.\nMy expectation is, as we go forward, we'll continue to talk about those markets, and we'll talk about the applications that we're developing. And the technology organization is continuing to look at how else can we use our capabilities in manipulating the molecules, and particularly hydrogen and carbon molecules, to make products that society needs and at the same time reduce emissions. So I think that organization has been given a license, a hunting license, to go out and find how we can lean into and create more value out there and grow earnings. So my expectation is, as we go forward well beyond the 2027 timeframe, we're going to continue to bring in opportunity sets as we unlock them through the work of both our product solutions organization but also our technology organization.\nAnd then, of course, we can take advantage of our project organization to then go off and build these things at scale and do it at a lower cost than anybody else. So I think there's a really powerful combination there. Our horizon extends well beyond the 2027 in terms of thinking through the pipeline and making sure that we're positioned to be successful well into the future. I would just quickly add then, and that's true for product solutions, which has got the chemical portfolio, our specialty portfolio, and then what I would say are the energy portfolio, but more specifically the molecules that go into energy that we expect to become feedstocks of the future like they are today for our Carbon Ventures and Proxima Ventures.\nOn the upstream side, we've got a lot of, obviously, growth potential through the back end of this decade, but this is a depletion business. We recognize that. And so that organization continues to look well beyond the 2027, 2030 time horizon, making sure that we have got a good understanding of what it's going to take to keep that pipeline full. So I feel really good about that. I think the way we've organized the businesses and the central organizations that we've put in place to serve those businesses is going to have huge payoffs here in this space.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Read\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning. Since y'all have probably the most geographically diverse set of operations of anyone we cover, I was just curious. The most recent news this morning shows maybe a few cracks in the economy.\nIf you could kind of give us an idea as you look across the products and the chemical side, thinking that's where we really see the demand parts, what you're seeing kind of, let's say, China back around to our side of the globe?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. Good morning, Roger. I think the key message I would leave you with across our business is, when you look at kind of pricing and margins, there's two halves to the equation. There's the demand side, and there's the supply side. On the demand side, frankly, to start with chemicals, we see the demand basically returning to the kind of growth that we've seen prior to the pandemic, so basically growing at 1% to 2% above GDP. And so that's back on track from a growth standpoint. And certainly, that's what we're seeing H1 of this year.\nThe challenge in that business with the margins has been, frankly, from the supply side of the equation, with a lot of capacity coming on and a queue of capacity yet to come on. So that's been more of the story in chemicals, less of a demand and growth story, and more of a supply story, with a lot of supply coming on in the short term. Like the past, the challenge in the chemical business, given the large chunks of capacity that come on in discrete times, is that you've got to grow through that capacity to get your margins back up again. One of the reasons why we stay so very focused on low-cost of supply, feed advantage, and, importantly, performance products is to make sure that we've got advantages above and beyond the commodity cycle.\nYou see that playing out now in our chemical business with earnings that, frankly, are well above what would be expected given the challenging market conditions that we see in the margin environment. China is growing, despite maybe some of the, it's not growing at the rates that we've seen historically, the very high rates, but it's still growing at a healthy clip. As you come around to the US, we're seeing kind of reasonable economic conditions and growth in the US as well. Europe, I think, is probably the most challenged area of the globe. Frankly, with some of the policies we see Europe implementing, my expectation is it becomes even more challenging, quite frankly, and unfortunately, particularly unfortunate for the folks living in Europe, given the, I think, the drag that the policy they're putting in place is going to put on their economy.\nSo I think China's looking reasonable. India is growing and looks very, very healthy. The US is looking reasonable with good growth. Demand, on the energy side of the equation with petroleum products, continues to be very high. Record levels of demand around the world. And again, I think very good supply coming into the equation there, which has brought margins from those very high levels that we've seen in the first quarter and then back into last year. We're now getting back down into more typical ranges. And frankly, all of our plans anticipated that. It's always difficult to call the timing of it, but we certainly knew that the elevated margins that we were seeing in the refining business would ultimately come back into normal ranges. My expectation going forward then is we'll continue to see what I would say is historical volatility levels in that.\nWe'll see times when the margins spike, and we'll see times when the margins are challenging. But again, we've built our refining business to be robust to those. If you look at the work we've been doing to high-grade that portfolio, we've taken out a lot of the low-margin, less advantaged refineries and are now focused on the integrated refineries that have a mix of high-value products that we're producing and are advantaged from a size, scale, and cost standpoint. Then on the gas side of the equation and the oil side of the equation, oil demand continues to be at record levels. Last year was a record. We anticipate this year will be a record, and then next year will be a record. Demand continues to be fairly healthy from an oil standpoint.\nIt's just a question of working through the supply that's coming on, most of that led by what's happening in the Americas. And then on gas, that's going to continue to grow in demand. And it's another, again, a function of the capacity that's coming on. So I think good news is we're seeing the industry be very responsive to the demand. And frankly, it's very consistent with the foundation of the strategy that we put together, which is you got to be low cost. You got to be on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. Thanks, Roger.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, Darren and Kathy. You continue to make good progress on the cost savings front. It looks like there was an uptick of about $600 million sequentially.\nIt looks like you called out kind of a $200 million turnaround savings in energy products. Just wanted to see if you could provide some more examples of what's driving the improvement and how you take the current kind of $1.07 to 1.5 billion over the next few years. Thanks.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the question. And so you're right. If we look on an after-tax basis, we had about $600 million overall on a pre-tax basis for the year to date, where our structural cost savings is about $1 billion. So making really good progress. Continuing to optimize maintenance is a big driver of overall savings. We gave a number of $200 million in energy products in terms of my prepared remarks. And that was just noting that in the half, we had a particularly heavy turnaround slate.\nIf we looked back at that same turnaround slate the last time we did it, we did it much more quickly, and we did it at lower cost, hence the $200 million savings number that you mentioned. We're also obviously driving savings in terms of supply chain and looking to get more efficient there. All of our centralized organizations, which we've kind of stood up over the last couple of years, are really responsible for driving savings into the business. So whether that's global business solutions or whether that's supply chain, or our global operating and sustainability group who works on our maintenance activities, we're really starting to see the uptick from the benefit that those organizations can bring by simplifying things and standardizing things, and bringing better data analytics to optimize our overall organization. That's what you're going to continue to see on a go-forward basis.\nAnd then I would say longer term, as those centralized organizations start to standardize processes for the company, which are quite disparate as we sit here today, we'll be able to apply more technology to get, I would say, even more automated in the things that we do, which will drive further efficiencies for us long term. So whether it's getting more efficient on logistics or getting more efficient because we're standardizing now between ourselves and Pioneer, standardizing all the materials and things that we're buying, those are the types of things that'll continue to drive savings. And I think we have both the largest program by far of anybody in the industry and now a very proven track record that we feel quite good about, typically over-delivering on the initial plans that we develop.\nSo we're feeling good about the progress we're making and that overall target to get to $15 billion in savings between 2019 and 2027.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil",
    "content2": "Yeah. I would just, I guess, one other way to think about it, Josh, is for the first time in the history of our corporation, we've organized ourselves to focus on every aspect of delivering the business, irrespective of what that business is, looked at where the synergies exist, and are now taking the experience, the collective experience of the corporation, and the expertise in each of those areas and focusing it on an opportunity set. So the size of our business gives us a huge advantage here. A lot of these things you're seeing are accruing by basically taking the best thinking that had occurred around the organization, around the world, and then applying that uniformly everywhere it's relevant.\nAnd that's happening time and time and time again. And so I think a very unique capability and capacity that, frankly, others can't match. And the benefits are showing up in these structural cost savings, for sure, also showing up on the revenue side of the equation with respect to better marketing, better ability to sell into value. So there's, I think, huge benefit to the changes we've been making.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGood morning. I'd like to paraphrase a comment Darren made that lithium complexity is misunderstood by the industry. And I'm intrigued. Is that a comment around the marketing and the relative youth of the downstream side, or is it a comment around maybe the upstream and the complexity of processing?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, Bob. Yeah.\nThat comment, I meant to imply, for more broadly the whole low carbon solutions business set, where, as you look at each of those businesses, they've got their unique set of complexities. For lithium in particular, you're taking what is essentially a brand new technology, marrying that with some established technologies for subsurface, some established technologies above surface consistent with our processing experiences in refining and chemicals. And so putting those things together in a new business to make a product, I wouldn't say has complexities that people can't comprehend. I would just say they're new, and there haven't been very many people who have worked their way through that. Where some really unique challenges are is in the building brand new value chains and the carbon capture market as an example, where there's not an existing market today that pays for carbon removal that's being incentivized with government policy.\nGovernment policy is forming. Well, at the same time, you're trying to build the infrastructure to support that market, the logistics, the supply, and then at the same time, develop a customer base. And so the complexity that I see in the low-carbon space, that's a particularly challenging one because of all the moving parts and all the work that has to be done to try to piece those things together to come up with, frankly, a business and business model that, one, is sustainable for the long term, and two, that generates returns that are competitive in the portfolio. But I have to say we're geared to do that kind of work. Our experience lends itself to that. And frankly, what Dan and the team is accomplishing, leaning on a lot of the core capabilities of the organization, we're tackling those challenges and making really good progress.\nI think on the hydrogen side of the equation, there's not a real vibrant market or a strongly economic market for low, virtually carbon-free hydrogen. So that's being developed. Obviously, the government incentives are supporting that in the short term, but we've got to work our way to a market-driven force so that we are competing in an open market and not relying on government subsidies. So that's, I think, one of the challenges in that space. But I think my comment was more generally that there's a lot of optimism around the low-carbon businesses in general. But if you think about where progress has been made to date, most of that's been in the wind, solar, and EV areas. And all of those are playing into well-established markets. The power generation market is very well established. The automotive industry is very well established.\nNow, they're bringing in new technologies that have some of their own unique challenges, but they're not building brand new markets. In our case and some of the businesses, we're building brand new markets.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nYep. That's very clear. Thanks for that.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. You, Bob, good talking to you.\n\nJim Chapman\n\nTreasurer and VP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Bob. And thanks, everybody, for joining the call and for your questions. We're going to post the transcript of this call to the investors section of our website by early next week. But before we wrap, I want to draw your attention to a couple of topics. First, a reminder. Later this month, we will be issuing our annual global outlook, which includes our latest views on energy demand and supply through 2050 and which forms the basis for our business planning.\nAnd second, please mark your calendars for our corporate plan update and upstream spotlight, which is going to be on Wednesday, 11 December. And for more information on that, again, please see the investors section of our website. With that, have a nice weekend, and I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation. You may disconnect at this time."

Welcome to ExxonMobil's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining the call today. I'm Marina Matsialenskaya, Director of Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investor section of our website. They are meant to accompany the Q1 earnings news release, which is posted in the same location.\nShortly, Darren will give you an overview of our performance. Then we'll take your questions. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide two. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Now, please turn to slide three for Darren's remarks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you for joining us. Our strategy and the way our people are executing created significant value in the Q1. We delivered $8.2 billion of earnings and $14.7 billion of cash flow. Even more important, we continue to strengthen the underlying earnings power of the company. An important driver of this improved earnings power is our ongoing focus on structural cost savings, which reached $10.1 billion in the quarter versus 2019, furthering our progress towards our goal of $15 billion by 2027.\nCapEx in the quarter was $5.8 billion, as we continue to invest in advantaged growth projects that will drive future earnings and cash flow. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet, bringing our net debt to capital down to 3%, the lowest in more than a decade. To reward our shareholders, we distributed $6.8 billion in cash, including $3.8 billion in dividends. For all of 2023, Exxon Mobil was the third-largest total dividend payer in the S&P 500. Only Microsoft and Apple paid more. We also repurchased about $3 billion of shares.\nBuybacks were temporarily paused until the shareholders of Pioneer voted on the combination of our companies, which they approved on 7 February 2024. Post-close, we expect buybacks to ramp up to a pace of $20 billion a year. Our ongoing success this quarter reflects the intense focus we have had for the past seven years on improving every aspect of our business. We developed a strategy tied more directly to our core competitive advantages. We reorganized the company to create a group of centralized organizations that fully utilize the significant synergies between our businesses.\nWe set and met ambitious plans to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company. We established a track record of excellence in execution that is second to none. Our focus on shareholder value extends beyond the work we're doing to drive profitable growth. I'll give you three examples from the quarter that demonstrate how we're working to ensure that the value we've created is not diminished through third-party actions. First, we filed for arbitration to confirm our rights and establish the value that the Chevron-Hess transaction places on the Guyana asset.\nThis will allow us to evaluate options to maximize the value for our shareholders. Any responsible management team would do the same. Second, we're continuing our lawsuit against two special interest activists masquerading as investors. We're asking the court to require the SEC's existing rules be consistently applied in order to restore the integrity of the system. We believe the system will only work properly if the rules are clearly understood and clearly applied to all parties. And third, we successfully defended the Pioneer merger against a frivolous lawsuit designed to abuse a legitimate legal process.\nThese actions are so common they are often referred to as a \"merger tax.\" In our case, however, the court ruled in our favor and sanctioned the lawyer for operating in bad faith. While the results of these efforts may not show up in any discrete quarterly result, they underpin long-term value and demonstrate our strong commitment to doing what's right. I'll leave you with a few key takeaways. Our work to improve the fundamental earnings power of ExxonMobil is continuing apace.\nBy executing with excellence on our strategy, we expect to grow our earnings potential by an additional $12 billion from 2023 to 2027 at constant prices and margins, a growth rate of more than 10% per year. A significant driver of this earnings growth will be our delivery of additional structural cost savings, totaling $15 billion by 2027. In the quarter, we continue to deliver unprecedented success in Guyana, with growing production creating additional value for our shareholders and the Guyanese people.\nOur strategic projects, which are another important driver of our planned earnings improvement, help deliver record first-quarter refining throughput and strong performance chemicals volume growth. And there are more projects planned for startup in 2025. All of this is without the contribution of Pioneer. With Pioneer, we're positioned to drive earnings, cash flow, and shareholder distributions even higher. We continue to work constructively with the FTC as they conduct a very thorough review and remain confident that no competition issues should hinder the transaction.\nWe've been working diligently on our integration plans, and we're ready to begin executing day one on the significant synergies this combination will create. Looking beyond our planned period and into the future, we see attractive large-scale opportunities to leverage our core capabilities in our existing businesses and in brand new markets with brand new products, something our competitors can't do. The success of this company and our unique set of competitive advantages is built on our greatest strength and most important advantage: great people.\nThey are the best team in the business, able to successfully overcome any challenge. Through their work at ExxonMobil, they are making a positive difference in the world, meeting people's essential needs for energy and products today and far into the future. I'm extremely proud to represent them and cannot thank them enough. Before we begin our Q&A session, I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce Jim Chapman, our new Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. Jim brings a breadth of capital market and functional experience to this role and is looking forward to working with all of you. Thank you.\n\nMarina Matsialenskaya\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a courtesy to the others in the queue, we ask all our analysts to limit themselves to one question. However, please remain on the line in case we need any clarifications. With that, Operator, please open the line for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. The first question comes from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Jim, congrats on the new role if you're on the line. I wanted to start on Guyana and not on the arbitration process, although I appreciate some of the posted prepared remarks on that, but instead just on the operations and growth potential. You had another really strong operational quarter, and then you've now also taken FID on Whiptail, which is new since the last call, and gives us now line of sight in all the planned development through the end of this 2027 guidance period.\nAnd if we step back, as you're bringing these new FPSOs online, you also have a very active exploration and appraisal program. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that exploration and appraisal strategy here, what you're focused on over the next few years, the additional opportunities you see, and how that influences your view of longer-term growth potential post-2027 in Guyana.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. Good morning, Devin. I'll try to address the broader picture here for you. I'll start, though, with just following up on the comment you made around the operations, performance of the operations. I think while we build these projects and bring them on in record time under budget, the value that the organization then drives from them through the operational optimization and looking to debottlenecking brings us significant additional value. And I continue to see opportunities to do that as we bring these platforms on.\nSo I feel really good about the collective effort of the organization to drive value of the plans that we already have in place through 2027. As you say, we're doing more exploration. I think every time we drill, we're collecting information that allows us to better characterize that whole block and focus in on potential new areas of opportunity. That's basically the work that our teams are very engaged in: continuing to collect information, continuing to do seismic, continuing to drill, and through that work, update our reservoir models, update our understanding of that block, and then look for new opportunities.\nThat's going to be a continuous progress. So I feel that's the work that we're doing. As we develop that, learn more, we'll put together more longer-term plans. Once we have confidence that we've got a clear line of sight to how this plays itself out going forward in the future, we'll bring that to the community and share that with all of you. Kathy, anything to add?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nI just mentioned we had planned kind of four of what I'll call wildcat wells this year. We did have one discovery, a new discovery, Bluefin. We haven't quantified what that is yet. But as you mentioned, Darren, most of the drilling that we're doing is more about supporting existing production and the next couple of projects that we have coming online.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director and Head of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, Darren Woods, Kathy Mikells, team. Just wanted to build on the comments on structural cost savings. So slide seven is helpful. It gives us a little bit more of a breakdown by each of the four segments of how you're thinking about cost savings to get to the $15 billion. But I was wondering if you could put a little bit more meat on the bone so you can give us examples, potentially by segment, of things that you're doing, so we can bring that story to life.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I'll talk maybe on the macro with respect to where the costs are coming from and how they break down. And then I'll let Kathy add any specifics that she wants to. But I would just say, Neil, if you look at what we've been doing here in the $10 billion of structural cost savings that we've achieved to date, it really has to do with the reorganizations that we started back in 2018 and the continued progress we make in centralizing activities, finding areas of synergies, and focusing on how do we drive the most value out of those synergies, eliminating areas of duplication.\nTaking expertise and experience that we've had in the past scattered across the corporation in different silos, putting those into centralized organizations, getting the collective wisdom of that group and experience to focus on some of our toughest challenges. Part of that is making sure that we're the lowest-cost supplier. And so reducing cost is a big challenge that the organization's looking at, and these experts are continuing to look for opportunities to optimize and to strike the balance of higher reliability, safer operations, while continuing to find efficiencies. And that's exactly what they've been doing.\nI think it's important to put the cost reductions in context, that as we've made these reductions, our reliability has improved. As we've made these reductions, our safety has improved. We have less injuries on our facilities all around the world. As we've made these reductions, our environmental performance has improved. And so it's a great example of how we can do both of these things with the right experience and capabilities. And so that's, and I think we're just at the early stages of quantifying the value and developing a clear line of sight to how we can take advantage of the most recent centralized organizations.\nWe'll be going through a plan process this year. Now that we've got those organizations in place and working with the rest of the businesses and the other centralized organizations to figure out what more can we bring to the table. But I'm extremely optimistic that not only will we hit the $15 billion certainly by 2027, but I suspect we'll find even more. And then with respect to, I'd say, a macro breakdown, I think the way to think about it is roughly split evenly today between our upstream and our product solutions business. Kathy, any specifics you want to add?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I guess a little bit more color. I'll add, if I just talk about what went on in the period, we saw most of the year-over-year incremental savings coming through upstream and coming through energy products. In upstream, that was driven largely by operational efficiencies and in the information that we would have pushed earlier this morning in terms of the more thorough discussion of the investor relations slides that we published on our website.\nI talked about an example at Kearl where we've basically automated kind of all of our heavy trucking there and how that drives, both as Darren mentioned, an improvement overall from a safety perspective, but also operating efficiency with the logistics and just efficiency of that trucking operation. If I then contrast that with energy products, we had a really heavy slate of maintenance in this past quarter, and those turnarounds were actually done more efficiently than the same turnarounds the last time the company would have had to have executed them.\nAnd so that drove structural cost savings for us. If I then try and look forward, what do we anticipate between now and 2027? Part of what I mentioned is some of these centralized organizations are really responsible for driving savings across the company. And so we have our global operations and sustainability organization. That organization is using statistical maintenance analysis across our entire footprint in order to drive better efficiency and effectiveness in our planned maintenance activity.\nAnd again, as Darren mentioned, that should drive improvement in safety and, importantly, improvement in reliability as well. We have stood up last year a global business solutions organization, and they're really responsible for standardizing some of these big end-to-end processes that we have: procure to pay, record to report, record to report, as well as our planning activities. And as we standardize those, we can implement more technology in order to improve the automation of many of those activities.\nWhen we benchmark ourselves, we know that we're too heavy on manual activities relative to what we would consider best in class. And so that should drive incremental savings. And then I'll just mention supply chain. Again, another central organization we stood up last year, really trying to now leverage the scale of the entire company. And so that's all about logistics, right? And how can we leverage our scale to drive more efficient logistics?\nHow can we leverage our scale to drive more effective supply chain, including utilizing more effective procurement? It's also about then driving down kind of materials and broader inventory as we just get more efficient. As we look forward, we have big savings expected kind of coming out of those areas.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director and Head of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Big numbers. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Neil.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. I'd like to come back to one of the things addressed in the opening comments on the Pioneer transaction and the expectation of the Q2 close. Can you just give us an idea of what final hurdles we're actually waiting for here? I know there's various rules with the FTC and so forth in terms of days. Just curious what gives you the confidence on the Q2 close here.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, good morning, Roger. I'll give you just kind of a high-level perspective. I'm not going to obviously comment on the specifics of the discussion and the work that we've been doing with the FTC, other than to say it has been a constructive engagement. We're working with them cooperatively. They've supplied an enormous amount of material documents, contracts, and line items on productions and sales. And so I think a very thorough review of this transaction. As we've said all along, we're very confident that there are no antitrust issues. And I would just say we're very optimistic that we'll meet the objective that we set very early to close in Q2.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Betty Jiang with Barclays.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe bring in the question earlier about the cost savings, bringing that in the context of the $12 billion of earnings growth potential you see between 2023 and 2027. Really appreciate the additional color given on the key drivers between upstream, downstream, and structural savings. But I want to ask about the cadence of that earnings growth profile, whether that's expected to be ratable through the period, and what do you see as the upside and downside risks to that outlook?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. I'm happy to answer that question. So if you look at overall, we've said $15 billion in cost savings from 2019 to 2027. We've achieved kind of on a year-to-date basis about 10. That means we have about five to go. You wouldn't expect that cost savings or other drivers of improvement are necessarily ratable. I mean, we see different initiatives kind of come quarter to quarter.\nSo I'd say I don't expect it to be ratable, but I expect us to put up meaningful cost savings every year. If you then look at some of the other drivers of that earnings growth, I think it's really important as you think about the EMPS business that that growth really goes hand in hand with execution of strategic projects, which also drives our high-value products growth. We expect about double the volume of high-value products from 2019 to 2027.\nIn 2027, we expect those products will comprise about 40% of our total earnings at a kind of constant margin. This year, we're relatively light on strategic projects in EMPS. Next year, in 2025, we will be really heavy. And so we'll have the Strathcona Renewable Diesel coming online. We'll be executing the RZID upgrade project in Singapore, and we'll have China One coming on, amongst other things, including increasing our capacity for advanced recycling at certain locations.\nSo we have a lot of activity that will then start to bring incremental earnings power in 2025 and beyond. And then I'd say if you look over at what's happening in the upstream business, we're continuing to get growth, obviously, out of Guyana and the Permian. That growth in advantaged assets is a real key driver in terms of overall growth in upstream. One of the things you would have seen in our presentation is that on a year-to-date basis, now 44% of our production volumes in upstream are from these advantaged assets, which are a key driver of earnings growth.\nAnd then I'd say the other thing to think about in upstream is we will start to get production growth, so actual volume growth improvement, but that tends to come more strongly in the beyond 2025 period. So hopefully that gives you a good feel for some of the big drivers and when we would be anticipating them starting to get reflected in our underlying earnings.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, and I'll just add to Kathy's comments. If you look at cost reductions, which Kathy talked about the value of those contributing to our earnings growth, I think there's not a lot of downside there. I think with the structural changes that we've made and have yet to realize the benefits of, we've got a pretty good track record now here over the last seven years of actually seeing what were initially concepts translate into bottom-line savings. And so we've got a very high degree of confidence in that.\nFrankly, our challenge in reducing cost or driving improvements in the business is not a lack of ideas or opportunities. It's how we prioritize and execute the highest value of those. So we've got a great opportunity set for improving our own business, and it's just a question of pacing that in a way that maintains the other objectives that we have in the business in terms of delivery day in and day out. On the revenue side of the equation, and to Kathy's point, the strategic projects are kind of at the heart of growing the revenue and the value side on the top line.\nAnd I would say we recognized going back in time that critical to doing that was advantaged projects and then an organization that had the capability to effectively deliver those advantaged projects. And then finally, an organization that was capable of starting those up seamlessly and getting them online quickly. I think if you look at the big projects that we brought on to date, all this portfolio of projects we developed back in 2018, we're continuing to execute that.\nThe ones we brought online, we've been very pleased with one, with the project execution, the technologies organization's contribution to that, and then how we've started up and run those. So I think that gives me a lot of confidence going forward that the model that we've put together, the focus that we've put in each of our businesses to contribute their area of expertise to overall corporate success, is demonstrating a lot of success. So I've got a lot of confidence going forward that we'll continue to deliver that portfolio that's demonstrated its value to what we've done to date. So I think I feel pretty confident about delivering through 2027 and frankly beyond.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. That's a really robust pipeline of projects to watch. Thank you for all the detail, and sir.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nHead of Americas Energy and Transition and Senior Analyst of Global Metals and Mining, Bernstein Research\n\nGood morning. I had a question around the use of the phrase carbon materials. It seems fairly new, feels fairly new, feels again pursuing some things in the battery chain. Could you give us a little more flavor on what you're contemplating there?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. Good morning, Bob. It's good to hear from you. I think one of the points we're trying to make is this company has a very broad suite of capabilities that's anchored, frankly, in technology and a technology that's focused on transforming hydrogen and carbon molecules. And a lot of what we've done to date and the value that the company's generated over the last many decades has been a function of energy and the consumption of those molecules to meet the growing demands for energy.\nBut we also have a very broad portfolio of other products that we make through that molecule transformation expertise into the chemical business, as well as lubricants and fluids and things that we do out of our refineries. So there's a much broader set of capabilities and products than I think, frankly, what people give us credit for. I would just point to Proxima as a great example of some time back, we recognized that the demand for gasoline would attrit, particularly in developed countries.\nAnd the question we challenged our technology organization with was, how can we use these molecules to make other products that are required to meet other needs in society? And Proxima, I think, while it's early in its development, it's going to demonstrate that we can take that expertise, apply it to a feedstock that will become more and more advantaged with time, and make other products that are needed for the world, and that will bring a lot of significant benefits in those applications. The carbon ventures and the carbon materials is a very similar initiative.\nIt's just a little earlier in its construct. If you look at the world's efforts to decarbonize, it's clear to us that carbon over time will become a more and more advantaged feedstock. And so the challenge we've given our organization is, what can we do with carbon molecules? How can we meet growing needs and large markets? And they have to be large markets because we're going to do something that moves the needle for the corporation. We have to do it at scale.\nAnd so what we're looking at there is how do we use the capabilities we have in molecule transformation applied to carbon to meet needs. Batteries are just one example. Carbon fibers are another. There's a number of things today we have there are applications for, but there's either a performance dimension that needs to be improved or a cost dimension that needs to be improved. We think we have a line of sight for how we can do that, how we can improve the performance aspects using our technology capabilities, and at the same time, find ways to reduce the cost of production.\nSo it's early days, I would say. We put it out there in this call to make sure people are beginning to think more broadly about what this company is capable of and how our future could evolve in a very different direction than where we've come from. The beauty of how we're positioning ourselves is we're using the same core capabilities and advantages. So it gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility. To the extent these other new markets work out and demand picks up and we see great opportunities, we can shift more resources into that space.\nIf it takes us longer there or if, say, the transition takes longer, we've got our base business and continue to invest in products that the world needs today. And so we've got the ability to adjust depending on how things evolve and depending on what direction the world goes. So I think it's just a great example of, again, anchoring back on some very core capabilities that have very broad application. And we're excited by what we see as some potentially very high-value new markets with some very high-value, unique products that we can supply to meet those needs.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nHead of Americas Energy and Transition and Senior Analyst of Global Metals and Mining, Bernstein Research\n\nVery clear. A question would be the materiality threshold. Should we think about runways to billion-dollar businesses or $10 billion businesses, or is that too simplistic?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nNo, I think it's a good measure to think about. You just got to be over a billion if it's going to be material. So we're looking at very large markets into the billions.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nHead of Americas Energy and Transition and Senior Analyst of Global Metals and Mining, Bernstein Research\n\nGreat. Very clear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director and Energy Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Hey, morning. I had a question about uses of cash and the balance sheet. I think this quarter we're seeing Exxon's net debt to capital move down. Some of your peers are starting to move up as commodities come off a bit. And that's seemingly a bit of a differentiator between you and peers. I thought it'd just be a good opportunity if you could remind us how you think about utilizing that balance sheet capacity moving forward, given you're still operating from a position of strength, whether it be deploying for future M&A, increasing buybacks, or other opportunities. Thanks.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSo I'm happy to talk about that. As you correctly referenced, our net debt to capital has come down. It's about 3% now. Our approach in terms of capital allocation has not changed. It continues to be very consistent. First and foremost, we want to make sure that we're making investments in this business that ultimately drive the long-term earnings and cash flow growth that create the virtuous cycle of us then being able to enhance shareholder returns and return cash to shareholders via dividends, as well as a more consistent share repurchase program.\nThat's job number one. I would mention that CapEx is not seasonal. I've seen many people comment on a light CapEx number that we had in Q1. We are very much on our plan. Many times our CapEx is influenced by milestone payments, just as an example. It is not readable over the course of the year. We have guided to $23 to 25 billion in CapEx, and that guidance remains. We're very much on plan. When we think about investing in our business, obviously, we're very focused on the advantaged slate of investments that we have organically in front of us.\nBut obviously, M&A is another type of investment that we make. Again, where we see we can make one and one equal more than two, largely by adding synergies to some type of acquisition. And obviously, getting ready to close the Pioneer acquisition would be a terrific example of that. We know a strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage. And so we have continued to really maintain and strengthen that balance sheet. This quarter, we paid down a little over a billion in debt. That's part of the reason why you see our net debt to cap ratio coming down.\nThat gives us a lot of flexibility to ensure that we're consistently investing in the business through the cycle. It just gives us optionality, understanding that we operate in a very cyclical business. Then clearly, we're looking to reward our shareholders. I think you see that with our very consistent approach to the dividend. It needs to be sustainable. It needs to be competitive. It needs to be growing. We obviously raised the quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter by $0.04 and continue to review that over time. I would mention one thing with regard to share repurchases. We did have the Pioneer vote this quarter. So we were out of the market for a period of time.\nWe did about $3 billion in share repurchases. A run rate to hit the $17.5 billion, which is what we've kind of guided to this year, would be more like $4.4 billion, right? So our program will naturally dial up our execution so that we're on track to complete the $17.5 billion share repurchase program on a standalone basis. And then I would remind you that we've said we anticipate taking that program pace up to $20 billion annually after we close the Pioneer acquisition. So we feel really good about where our balance sheet is at, and our consistent capital allocation strategy, and that that will drive long-term returns for shareholders.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nI would just add to Kathy's points that, and just remind everybody, if you look at where we stand today, and Jason made the point that we're deviating from our peers in terms of continuing to generate cash and drive down net debt, that's anchored in the strategy that we've put in place in 2018, which is find advantaged projects and invest in those to grow the earnings power of the business. That's now beginning to manifest itself. So I think you got to have a long-term view on this, having a robust balance sheet to make sure that we're positioned when opportunities come along and we see clear advantages to invest, that we have the capability to do that. Thanks for the question.\nYep. Got it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThanks. Maybe one on chemicals. Your chemicals businesses, the two segments continue to show kind of modestly better than expected recovery along the bottom or off the bottom here. Is this more of a feedstock tailwind that we're seeing in the near term? Are you seeing any improvements that are noticeable in terms of demand and overall global supply demand? And I guess in the meantime, while things are weak, what are you managing to do with your product mix or operations to drive relative performance there in chemicals?\nYeah. Sure, Ryan. I'll take that. First thing I would say is if you look at the chemical business and kind of the margin indicators that we use to judge the health of the chemical business, we are at a historic kind of bottom of cycle number. And so I think it's a very challenging chemical markets today, as I know many of you know. But even in that very challenged market, we are continuing to deliver very good results.\nAnd I think if you compare similar markets that were even close to these bottom of cycle conditions, we were in a very different place in the past with respect to earnings than we find ourselves today, where we delivered close to $800 million of earnings this quarter despite the very difficult market conditions. Those market conditions are driven more by supply than demand, frankly. We're continuing to see growth in demand, not as high as we've seen historically, but continued good growth.\nAnd frankly, in the Q1, saw some of that pick up. The challenge has been the supply that's come on to meet that growth. And so that is depressing overall industry margins. As you know, the investments that we make and the way we run our business is to make sure that we're advantaged versus the average chemical player. And so even in these markets that are set by other capacity, the work that we've done to position ourselves in a more advantaged position than competition continues to deliver a value. And you can see that with the growth not only in the high-value products, which are coming on with our projects.\nAnd frankly, that growth is in line with what we had expected. So we're continuing to see the demand for the high-value products that we've invested in. But we're also seeing it in our base volume value in those with respect to how we've positioned ourselves. And we're seeing advantages in the structural cost reduction. So I would tell you every part of what we've been doing to improve the earnings power of the organization is manifesting itself in our chemical business and showing up and differentiating earnings.\nAnd to your point, feed advantages play an important role in that. So that's yet again another advantage that we have versus the typical industry player. But that is reflective of the broader strategy that we have. So I think we feel good about where we're at in a very difficult market. Our view is that those market conditions are going to be with us for a little while here going forward, but we also feel like we're well positioned to be successful there. And as that shakes out and some of the less able competitors have no success in this space, we'll see growth continue to move. And eventually, we'll see margins pick back up, and we'll be very well positioned.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nAnd just the other thing I'd add to that is I think if you look at our chemical businesses' performance and compare that to peers and other players, you see the differentiation and the excellent execution really coming through. We're in clearly bottom of cycle conditions right now, and yet we're still generating pretty good earnings and cash flow in our chemical business.\nAnd then I would just mention that, as Darren noted, our footprint tends to be North American weighted.\nAnd so if you just look at our PE and PP footprint, we're heavily North American weighted and relatively lightly weighted to Asia compared to rest of industry. And Asia is especially at very, very bottom of cycle conditions.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGreat. Thanks. Over to you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephen Richardson of Evercore ISI.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning. Darren, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Baytown project and maybe just if you could give us a little bit more on what your view of adequate incentives there would be. If the PTC on green hydrogen was extended to blue, would that be sufficient to sanction the project? And then, sorry, just as a follow-on to that, as you talk about a level playing field across and technology neutrality, is your view that a new gray hydrogen ATR should get some sort of incentive? Maybe you could just give us the context of how you're thinking about that project and what it needs to move forward. Thank you.\nYeah. Sure. I'm happy to do that, Steve. What I would say is that work we're doing to develop it is, I think, demonstrating the difficulty of starting brand new businesses and value chains where none exist, and that we're kind of simultaneously trying to build demand, trying to build supply, and then trying to, in the early days of this market, establish financial incentives to do that. And so three core key variables to a successful business all kind of basically being generated for the first time in this space along this value chain.\nSo I just put that out there as it's a challenging construct, but frankly, one that plays to our strengths and the ability to look along the entire value chain. And we are uniquely situated to manage each piece of that. There are very few, if any, companies out there that have a portfolio and capabilities that extend end to end along this value chain. So I feel good about what we're doing there and the work that we've put in place. And frankly, it looks to me like a very viable project. We are continuing to progress that.\nBut it will require that the necessary incentives are in place. And with respect to what's required with incentives, I would say the IRA and the incentives that were developed as part of the IRA are enough to do that. The challenge is taking the IRA, which I believe rightly focused on carbon intensity and incentivizing carbon intensity, translating that legislation into regulation. If the regulation reflects the intent of that legislation and writes the rules focused on carbon intensity, that will be enough to justify and to incentivize and give us a return on this investment. We don't focus so much on the green, the blue, and color schemes.\nWe instead focus on how can we meet what is ultimately the objective here, which is to reduce the CO2 associated with the production of these products. We think all the work we've been doing in our facilities, our feedstock, and decarbonizing those contributes to that. So we feel like we're well positioned with the existing set of incentives as long as those incentives are fairly reflected in the regulations. A level playing field, what I mean by that is staying focused on carbon intensity and ignoring colors.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Royall of JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I just had a question about the refinery sale in France. I know you have a very ambitious program for growth in the downstream business, but you have been trimming and high-grading a bit with some asset sales. Other majors are also reducing their European footprint in refining. Can you just speak to how strategic the remaining European portfolio is? And could we see some more assets shake out in European downstream?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Sure. And I would tell you what you're seeing with the sale in France is really the latest in what's been a fairly long trend with us focused on upgrading refineries to refineries that have the capability to address a broad suite of products and high-value products. And so integrated facilities that make not only petroleum products but also make chemicals, and lubricants, and basically a broad array of high-value products. And so we've been over time focused on that.\nThey need to be advantaged sites. They need to be. We have a cost of supply curve. I think you all have heard me talk about this many times across all of our businesses, but we look around the world and make sure that our facilities are on the low cost of supply so that as the margins move up and down, that we never become the marginal supplier. Having an integrated facility helps with that, but it also acts as a hedge to make sure that we're not dependent on any one sector for the success of one of our manufacturing facilities.\nThe reorganizations that we put in place have helped greatly with this. And if you think about these integrated facilities, we used to have them split up among different parts of the organizations and different businesses running them. And in fact, even different manufacturing organizations running them. Today, that's not the case. Today, they're being run by a single business with a single leadership team. And so I feel very good about that. But it is this continuing hybrid.\nWe were doing it all the way back when I was president of the refining company. So it's been a long-term strategy. We're not in a hurry. We're taking our time to make sure that we find the right buyer that has the right value proposition, one that exceeds our own internal values. And if we can find that, we will then transact. If we can't, we'll continue to optimize and improve those refineries to the best of our abilities. But I would say we've worked our way down the portfolio so we feel pretty good about the position that we're in today, that the refineries that we have in the portfolio are advantaged, have a mix of either feed advantages or product advantages, or both.\nAnd frankly, our focus has been on making sure they're running reliably, running safely, running efficiently. And these centralized organizations and our global operations and sustainability organization have been a huge enabler to helping each of these facilities and our chemical plants or refineries, lubricant facilities all improve their performance, run better, run more profitably, run safer, run more reliably.\nSo I feel really good about the position that we're in. And we'll continue to look at our portfolio. It's always been the case that we're looking to make sure that the value we see in those facilities exceed the values that others might. And I feel good about how we're positioned there.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nJust the other thing I'd add to that is the investment environment is certainly a bit more difficult in Europe. If you go back and look at the end of 2022, the additional taxes that were levied onto the energy sector, if you look at expanded disclosure requirements that Europe is looking for, or if you look at regulation around reducing carbon footprint and not necessarily implementing regulation that's technology agnostic and focused on just reducing carbon intensity, that all makes Europe a much tougher investment proposition. That's certainly one of the things that we look at in any place across the globe as we look to make future investment decisions.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Biraj Borkhataria of RBC.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head Energy Transition Research, RBC\n\nWe're fixing to take the next question from an analyst sitting in London. But I just have one question. You have a lot of LNG coming into your portfolio in the coming years, Golden Pass, Qatar, et cetera. You have quite a high oil weighting in the current sales mix. Are you looking to diversify over time, or would you like to maintain that kind of 80% to 90 oil-linked exposure in your contract base over time? Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Biraj. Thank you. I would tell you we're not as focused on an absolute mix number as much as the advantaged investment opportunities that we can find in those businesses. We see long-term demand for oil continuing, albeit with a much lower emissions footprint as we continue to find ways to decarbonize. We also see long-term demand for natural gas. And so I think as we look at both of those, both the liquids and the gas side of the equation, we see a long-term future there and an opportunity for this company to participate if we have advantaged projects that position us on a low cost of supply.\nAnd so that's how we think about that. That advantage position, which manifests itself in cost of supply, as you know, obviously manifests itself in above industry average returns, which is the objectives that we set for ourselves. So that's how we're thinking about it. Frankly, we'll let the opportunities that we find in these advantaged investments set the proportion of the portfolio that those represent.\nWe will not invest in a project that I'm not convinced doesn't, one, leverage our core competitive advantages, that two, then results in a project which is advantaged versus other, and that three, then is on the low cost of supply. Because as good as the market may look today out the window, we know there are cycles. We don't think the cycles are going away.\nAnd so we remain very focused on making sure that we take advantage of the upswings, but we're prepared for the downswings and will be very successful. And as we just talked about in the chemical business, great example of being in the very bottom of a downswing and continuing to generate cash and make good solid earnings. And that's the ambition we have for all of our businesses.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head Energy Transition Research, RBC\n\nUnderstood. And just as a follow-up to that, there's obviously been ongoing security challenges in Mozambique. And what is your view at this point on whether you'd be interested in doing a second floating facility? Because obviously monetizing the onshore part has become very challenging.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I think obviously you rightly pointed out there are security challenges there. I think there's been a lot of good progress made with respect to that. I think the country of Mozambique, the government of Mozambique recognizes the importance not only for the project, frankly, for the people of Mozambique that needs to be addressed and effectively managed. I think they've made good progress in doing that.\nMy view is, with time, we've seen this in other places around the world that will get addressed and it will result in an opportunity to invest onshore. With respect to onshore, offshore, we frankly, it comes back to the point I made at the beginning of your question, which is it depends on the returns that we can generate with respect to investment opportunities and how competitive those supply points are. If we can do that offshore, we obviously will. If it takes going onshore to do that, then we'll focus on onshore. But it will be a function of the returns of the projects.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head Energy Transition Research, RBC\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Josh Silverstein of UBS.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director and Head of Energy Research, UBS\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to see if I can get an update on the timing of the gas-to-power project in Guyana, and what benefits this may have to cost and operations in the country, and if there are any other projects like this that you guys may be looking at over time. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Sure. I think this is something that we've been engaged with the government on for quite some time. I think as we look at going into some of the countries that are on a growth path, on a developing path, we look for opportunities of how our footprint and presence in those countries and markets can help the people in the community.\nAnd this is a great example of that, of getting the gas that's produced offshore, onshore so they can replace what is a relatively inefficient, high-emissions power generation system that's fairly unreliable with something that's cleaner, lower emissions, and much more reliable and should be much more cost-effective. And so I think it's a kind of a win-win proposition, particularly for the people of Guyana. So we're working on bringing that gas to shore.\nOur expectation is we'll have that brought up sometime end of 2024. Obviously, the government's working on the receiving end of that gas and responsible for putting in the power station. That's an independent project that's developing. We're also working on the distribution system. And so it's really, I think, the impact of that will come when we get both pieces together and get that linked up and effectively delivering power to the market.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheung\n\nSenior Development Manager, Scotiabank",
    "content2": "Thank you. Hi. Good morning. Darren, in the presentation, you talked about the direct air capture. Can you give us some idea, and you're saying that you aim to reduce the cost by half and that won't be sufficient. So what will be needed in order how much is the actual cost reduction from the current level in order for that to be competitive or that to be a real business for you? And also, can you talk about how your approach or technology is different than what currently in the market, especially one of your competitors in the US. They said that they have a commercial operation ready and it's going to come on stream very soon. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Sure. Good morning, Paul. Yeah. What I would say is, may I start with the last point of your comment, which is, yeah, there are alternatives out there today versus what we're working on. The issue is the cost associated with them. And we're not looking at what we can commercialize in the short term based on what I would say is a very narrow market of limited customers who are willing to pay a very high price to demonstrate a level of decarbonization.\nWe're focused on how we can make this technology broadly applicable at a cost that society can afford. So we are very focused on the long term, not the short term. And our view is the available technologies today don't meet the cost requirements. And that's somewhere between $600,000 per ton of CO2 removed. And our view is, if you try to apply that across the emissions challenge the planet has, the world won't be able to pay for that. So we've got to find a reduction.\nOur cost, we've set an initial target of cutting the cost in half just because that is a significant step change, recognizing it won't be enough. But if we can develop the technology to a point that we're successful there, that gets us on this path and demonstrates the value of the concepts that we're developing to keep on going and drive further down. With respect to the technology and how it compares to what's commercially available out there, I would say part of the reason why this is proprietary technology is, today, it's proprietary. And so I'm going to keep it that way.\nI would say it is a brand new approach. There are others who are out there working on new approaches as well, which, frankly, we're happy about. This is a tough challenge to break. I'm not pretending like we're going to be the ones to solve it. I am confident that we will give it all, give it all applying our capabilities. Others are doing that. As I said in my prepared remarks that we posted, if there's a breakthrough, it doesn't so much matter who has the breakthrough. I think we're going to have a role to play. Because once we have a technology that gets to the right cost level, you're going to need global deployment at scale.\nAnd I suspect that the technology that will be required for the future, lower cost direct air capture, will be different than what we've got today and will require some of the technical capabilities that we have. So I see a role for us in the future if this nut gets cracked. We feel good about what we've seen so far, but we're very early into it. We're hopeful that we'll make the progress that we're aspiring to and continue to drive the cost down.\nYour last point you asked, I think to me, if you're going to be if the world's if it's going to be affordable, you've got to get into the $100-ish a ton of CO2 to start talking about broad deployment around the world. I think that's ultimately where we need to get to.\n\nMarina Matsialenskaya\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, everybody, for joining the call and for your questions today. We will post the transcript of our Q&A session on our investor website next week. Additionally, we look forward to connecting again on 29 May 2024 for our annual shareholders meeting. Now, let me turn it back to the operator to close the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Webcast. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining the call today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm joined today by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors Section of our website. They're meant to accompany the fourth quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will give you an overview of our 2023 performance. Then we'll take your questions.\nIn conjunction with our recent announcement about acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources, we've included additional information about the transaction on slide 2. Please be aware that this presentation is not intended to be a solicitation of any vote or approval. During today's call, we'll make forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our Cautionary Statement on slide 3. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, including an overview of full year results which are posted on the website. Now I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. I want to start with the theme of the quarter, which frankly has been a theme of the year. Excellence in execution. Whether it's operating our facilities, building projects, deploying technologies, trading, marketing, sales, supply chain, for any of our other activities. The men and women of ExxonMobil are setting and holding themselves to very high standards as they execute their responsibilities.\nTheir hard work and commitment drove the strong results we reported today and are the foundation of our success. At the end of the day, it's all about our people that make the difference and are delivering industry-leading results.\nNothing is more important than the safety of our people. Keeping them safe requires intense focus and relentless discipline 24 hours a day, every single day. For many years, we've outperformed industry benchmarks for workplace safety. Over the last several years, we've been implementing improved systems for managing both personnel and process safety, leveraging best practices from across our company and industry, our own and others. These efforts are paying off with continued improvements in the number and severity of incidents. The discipline needed to consistently deliver industry-leading safety performance manifests itself in all of our work. We see it in our project teams. We're delivering large capital projects at top-quintile performance on cost and schedule.\nWe see it in the reliability of our operations where we achieved record performance in both the upstream and refining. We see it in our environmental performance where we set several new records. We see it in the successful management of the transformational reorganizations we've made over the last several years.\nResults are clear. By any measure, 2023 was an outstanding year. We delivered $36 billion of earnings, strong cash flows, and a 15% return on capital employed. Our strategy introduced in 2018, coupled with consistently strong execution, is delivering results that lead industry across a range of metrics including earnings and cash flow growth, total shareholder distributions, and total shareholder returns since 2019, the baseline year of our plans.\nOn a constant price basis, we more than doubled earnings in 2023 versus 2019, demonstrating the improved earnings power of the company.\nThe growth and profitability reflects significant progress in high grading our portfolio of assets through advantaged projects, divestment of less strategic operations, and significant cost reductions.\nDuring the year, our divestments generated more than $4 billion of cash proceeds. We also announced two value accretive acquisitions. Denbury, which closed in November, provides opportunities to profitably accelerate our low carbon solutions business with a compelling end to end customer decarbonization offer. Pioneer, which is expected to close in Q2, will further differentiate our advantaged upstream portfolio. The synergies will create significant shareholder value and accelerate Pioneer's net zero ambitions by 15 years to 2035. In 2023, we made significant advances in a number of innovative solutions.\nWe entered the lithium business where we see an opportunity to supply approximately 1 million electric vehicles per year by 2030. With economically advantaged production, it has a much smaller environmental impact than today's supply.\nIn the carbon capture and storage space, we recently completed the construction of a pilot plant to further develop a unique proprietary technology which has the potential to significantly lower the cost of direct air capture. We also launched Proxima, a thermoset resin with a high value in use for coatings, infrastructure, automotive parts, and wind power made from low value components used in gasoline. We also took a further step in reducing cost, leveraging scale, and improving effectiveness with the formation of three new centralized organizations, Global Supply, Trading, and Global Business Solutions.\nThis change provides additional opportunities to grow deep expertise across a broad portfolio of critical business capabilities. Today, we're convinced that no other company can match the depth and breadth of development opportunities that ExxonMobil offers. It's no surprise that for the 11th year in a row, we were recognized as the most attractive US employer in the industry for engineering students. This is another key competitive advantage.\nOur plan for 2024 remains anchored in our existing strategy. Building on world class execution and the performance we delivered last year, we set a high bar for ourselves across all aspects of the business from safety to operational excellence to financial performance, and have confidence in our team's ability to consistently deliver. For 2024, we expect to invest $23 to 25 billion to grow our portfolio of advantaged low cost of supply assets, further shift our product mix towards higher value, higher margin performance products and reduce emissions both our own and others.\nOur plan also continues to structurally reduce cost to achieve $15 billion in structural cost savings through 2027. We have opportunities to enhance supply chain efficiency, further improve maintenance and turnarounds, modernize data management, and simplify business processes.\nIn low carbon solutions, we'll continue the integration of Denbury and look to add additional customers to our US Gulf Coast network. As we noted during the corporate plan update in December, we're now pursuing more than $20 billion of lower emission opportunities, evenly split between reducing our own emissions and reducing third party emissions. Overall, our portfolio of low carbon investments is expected to generate returns of approximately 15%.\nOur upstream portfolio will be further transformed when we close on the transaction with Pioneer. By combining the capabilities of our two companies and leveraging the advances we've made in technology, we expect to recover more resource more efficiently with lower emissions. We'll provide more details about this compelling combination at our Spotlight event following the close.\nOur results in 2023 once again demonstrated the strength of our strategy. As I reflect on the past year, I have tremendous pride in what our people accomplished and a strong level of confidence in our continued ability to lead in the years ahead. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Now I'll turn it back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a courtesy to others in the queue, we ask all of our analysts to limit themselves to one question. However, please remain on the line in case we need any clarification. With that, operator, let's open the line for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone. The first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, good morning, Darren, team, and congrats on the strong results. My question was around the structural cost savings. So we're at $9.7 billion versus 2019, targeting $15 billion by 2027. Can you talk about the progression over the next couple of years? What are the key buckets and milestones we should be watching out for as it relates to those cost savings?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. Thanks, Neil. Good to hear from you again. Maybe just start with a little bit of perspective. If you think about where we have been driving efficiencies in what lies behind the improvements in structural costs, we've made tremendous changes in the organization, and we've been doing that each successive year sequenced with respect to what needs to come first, second, and third to make sure that we can effectively manage that.\nWe're still in the early stages of taking advantage of all the changes that we've made going back in time with our global technology organization, with our product solutions organization, that frankly brought refining together with our marketing and then together with chemical. So a lot of restructuring, a lot of opportunities, and all the organizations see a path to significantly improved effectiveness in executing the business. To your point, significant path to efficiency.\nOn top of that, we just launched our global supply chain organization. We just launched our global business solutions organization and our trading organization. They're early in their process, and all of them see significant opportunities for efficiency. I would say $9.7 billion is a reflection of the hard work coming from the reorganizations that we've done, and we're early in that. We've got additional additional reorganizations to take advantage of.\nThat $15 billion that you referred to is not a target. It is in our plans, and the plans reflect what the organizations are working on. So what are some of the areas? We've seen a lot of benefit today by a centralized approach to enhancing our maintenance and our turnaround processes. We've taken a lot of cost out with respect to that. We see an opportunity to bring further cost reductions there. The supply chain organization brings a huge opportunity. In the past, we had very fragmented supply chain organizations across all of our businesses. We've now consolidated all that.\nWe see a lot of opportunities to bring together our data and our processes, and harmonize those, and do those consistently across all of the organization. And then a lot of continuing optimization within the base business, taking advantage of the new construct and learning from one another. That's a huge part of the go forward reduction. So, I would just tie all that to the ongoing change and the fact that we now have a good line of sight across all of our organizations around the best way to do things and the most efficient ways to do things. I'll hand it over to Kathy if there's anything to add to that.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nThe only other thing I would add is how we're looking to leverage technology to both drive incremental efficiencies, but as importantly to drive effectiveness. So things like how we use artificial intelligence and chatbot in our customer care centers, right. Which gives our customers better service and obviously that drives efficiency for the company. How we use predictive analytics and things like driving maintenance turnarounds to top customers, kind of quintile type performance or similarly how we use those predictive analytics in our drilling and fracking centralized operation here in Houston. So you know, bringing together our information technology organization with our engineering and research organization will just further enhance I think how, overall, we as a technology company fundamentally try to use technology to both drive efficiency, but obviously to drive value in the business.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you, Kathy. Thanks Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Neil.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of Global Oil and Gas Equity, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone. Darren, 2018 was a long time ago, obviously, and a lot has changed since you pushed the doubling of cash flow from 2025 to 2027.\nIncluding much greater and perhaps faster progress in Guyana. So, I guess my question is where would you suggest we are in 2024 in moving towards that doubling of cash flow target? And specifically, what should we read about your CapEx comments in terms of the timing of Guyana as part of that target?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the back end of your question around the CapEx, and I mean it should be clear. Hopefully it's clear. We've provided guidance in a range in CapEx to give you a perspective of when we start the year based on the plans that we put together the previous year, where we think we're going to end up spending across the year. Obviously, as we're going through the business, each of the businesses are clear on their objectives to find value, creative opportunities, and to capture those as quickly as possible. So we've got an ongoing process.\nIf we see an opportunity that we weren't aware of at the time of putting together the plan, we're not constraining our activities based on some artificial number or the guidance that we've put out. We're very focused on making sure that it's going to be an effective use of capital, that we can efficiently execute what's required for that capital, and then that there's value behind it and there's an advantage in it. So that's how we're managing.\nWhat we talked about in the release with respect to our CapEx in 2023 reflects just that, incremental optimizations as we're going through the year. And my view is we'll continue to do that as we go forward into the plan years. Obviously we've given you some guidance that we believe reflect where we'll end up. But as we work the opportunities, we're very focused on that. I think the short term, what we've done with Guyana, you're seeing today in Payara, where we brought that online and frankly in January, well ahead of our plans, reached nameplate capacity.\nPart of that was around the optimization of the drilling and making sure that we had what we needed to bring that up quickly. In terms of the broader objective to get to 2027, I mean, we're on that plan and we're actually delivering the value that we laid out in 2018. I feel really good about the progress we've made. We noted in the release that if you look at just from 2019, the year before the pandemic, the advances that we've made in the business; we've, on a flat price, take margin, take price out of it. We've doubled the earnings capacity of the corporation from 2019 to 2023. We've grown earnings on a compounded annual basis by 40%, greater than 40%. We've grown cash flow from operations almost 20%, greater than 15%.\nSo I think significant progress; we've demonstrated that the work that we're doing, the projects that we put in place, the reorganizations that we've executed, the cost that we're cutting out of the business are all driving us towards this improved valuation. And frankly, the plans we have going forward are going to continue to do that. So the targets that we've laid out, what we communicated in our December company plan release, basically those are plans and we feel that we're right on track, if not slightly ahead of delivering on those. Kathy, anything to add to that?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I mean Doug, I'll just try to grind kind of back to those numbers a little bit more. Just so you understand it, on an earnings basis we actually more than doubled earnings on again that constant price basis that we used in our corporate plan, which Darren is referring to in the numbers that he just mentioned. So I would absolutely say we are ahead of our plan in terms of what it is that we're achieving and it's that earnings improvement that is flowing through to cash flow.\nAnd so, as you think about cash flow, our earnings expectation in the corporate plan in terms of doubling it, you know, out to 2027, it's well ahead of doubling it. And then those earnings just flow through to the cash flow growth. I would describe us as being ahead of plan in terms of where we stand today and feeling very good about the future.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of Global Oil and Gas Equity, Bank of America\n\nI think we would concur. Thank you very much indeed.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I've gotten some inbounds this morning just on the 2023 spending, and Darren, you kind of alluded to it in your response to the prior question. You were able to pull forward some CapEx for Guyana and Permian in Q4. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of that, types of efficiencies that you're seeing, and what specifically you're able to accelerate, and then how that influences your outlook for spending and production for both assets in 2024.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. And good morning, Devin.\nYou think about the complexity of what the organizations are dealing with, and in particular the upstream, that as we, as you go through the course of the year and they're drilling and they're collecting data and we're seeing the production, we've got a real-time optimization loop that takes the experience that we've had and builds it back into our go-forward plan. So it is a very dynamic process, and we've got, you know, to Kathy's point, a lot; we're using a lot of technology to make sure that we're learning from all the data that we're collecting as we go, and that we're adjusting our plans to optimize value.\nI, I would tell you the organization understands it has an obligation to drive value, and to find the value opportunities, and to make sure that when we decide to spend money, that we know that spend is going to be productive spend, and that we're going to be efficient in executing that spend. And beyond that, they're not constrained. If they find that we're going to hit a constraint or we're going to hit something that's not incorporating the plans, we have a conversation about that. So I would tell you, it is a very well controlled process.\nYour point about capital coming forward in the fourth quarter, I would tell you the decisions that we made that led to going a little above the guidance weren't made in the fourth quarter. Those were made as we were going through the year with a recognition that if we took some of the steps as we were going through the year, that as we got to the end of the year those numbers would grow, potentially butt up slightly above the guidance. And we made the decisions as we were going and it's a very dynamic process. So I think that's how I would think about it, that we're going to continue doing that going forward.\nObviously, the Permian we continue to learn with the technologies that we're bringing in there, the techniques that we keep evolving. So my expectation is we'll continue this to adjust. As we go to maximize the value of the production and what we're learning through the technologies that we're deploying. Then with Guyana, don't underestimate the complexity of these reservoirs and the challenges the organization has. As they're drilling and gaining information, we're optimizing that as we go as well. If we see an opportunity to advance the development and bring it forward and bring NPV with that, we'll take that.\nAnd so I would just tell you it's hard to predict because what are you going to learn? I mean, if we knew that now, it wouldn't be a learning. We'd know it. It would be built into the plan. So it's hard to really predict the learning piece of it. Anything to add, Kathy?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou know, I just say if you look at the specifics of what we delivered as a result of actually spending a little bit more on CapEx, I think you see that just goes hand in hand to how we drove value for shareholders.\nSo in the Permian, we had guided to 600,000 kind of oil equivalent barrels. We came in at 620,000. In Guyana, we had said 380,000. We came in at 390,000. Right. And you know, you think about where we're at in Guyana today, and you know, we've got Prosperity, you know, the third boat, which is in the Payara development, already up to nameplate capacity as we stand here today. And that's because we made the decision to drill more wells to ensure that we could get that boat up to capacity as quickly as possible. And our organization absolutely delivered on that. Those were the right economic decisions that drove value for our shareholders.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Yeah, agree. The strategy is certainly yielding great results. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Royall of JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my question's on Payara. You've expressed some confidence that you can ultimately get above the nameplate as you have on the first two platforms. Should we expect a kind of a continuous ramp towards a higher number, or does it run closer to nameplate for a period of time and then further unlock happens kind of more in a step change?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. I think, you know, just maybe step back and talk a little bit about the process. Organization does its best to design the projects for the capacities that we want to deliver. And then as they hand the CapEx, the projects group hands that off to the operating group. They're obviously, as they begin operation, testing to see, you know, where are we at with respect to constraints and every, you know, the advantage that we have here is that we've tried to stick to some consistent design.\nThis design one, build many concept. We've tried to the extent possible, maintain consistency from boat to boat. Obviously, as the subsurface and the complexity of the developments change, we have to make adjustments. So it's not quite a cookie cutter approach, but we tried to maintain a level of consistent consistency. One, because that keeps your capital cost down, but two, it allows us to take the learnings from the previous boats and apply it to the one we just started up and advance things faster, to do things quicker.\nAnd a great example for Prosperity is how quickly we managed to bring that unit up, get flaring down, and get to nameplate capacity. That was. We did that essentially at record times, which is a reflection of the fact that the organization, as they've been bringing these units, these production units online, that they're learning and then taking those learnings and forwarding it to the next boat.\nSo my expectation is you'll see us move faster and faster as we go. Difficult to predict exactly what that ramp up looks like or the step changes, if you will, because it'll be a function of what they bring into what the next constraint that they overcome to make sure that we can continue to run those facilities safely within all the operating limits, but at the same time maximize their value. So I would say take the previous ramp ups as a basis and then our expectation is the organization will find ways to do it even better.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nAnd then, if you don't mind, I'm just going to add because I know everybody is now going to be modeling what Guyana is going to look like for the year.\nSo this is just a reminder that at some point in the second half we're working on the gas to energy project, right? And laying the pipeline down to bring that gas from Liza 1 and Liza 2 onshore, you know, to basically kind of plug it into the power plant that ultimately will drive down costs for consumers in Guyana. And we will be taking Liza 1 and Liza 2 offline for a period of time as we kind of hook them up to that pipeline. So that's just a reminder that we'll have a little bit of downtime at some point in the second half.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGood morning, all. At the risk of oversimplifying, if I think about 2023, it was a very strategy-focused year. Denbury, Pioneer, lithium. If I look at 2025, it's a major project delivery year. 2024, is this a year of execution or could there be some level of strategic, interesting moves that we should think about?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. Good morning, Bob. I would just say you have oversimplified it. I would start with every year is a year of execution. And I think it's the fact that we have managed, maybe in comparison to some of our peers, to make it look easy and have executed, I think, at a high level, make no mistake, the organization that continues to be a real challenge across all of our operations.\nI think the men and women of ExxonMobil have done an outstanding job of consistently executing to a very high standard, as I said in my prepared remarks. So I don't want to take anything away from that. I also don't want to suggest that we for a minute take that for granted or take our eye off of that ball. So that's job number one. Even in bringing these projects online, that takes a tremendous amount of focus and discipline from an execution standpoint. So that is job one. Then obviously the strategy, you know, that is also.\nAn emphasis every year. It's just as we've always talked about, it's really a function of can we find the right opportunities, the right equation, equation that brings value to our shareholders. You know, if it's M&A, it's got to be, you know, one plus one has to equal three or more. If it's a project, it's got to be advantage. It's got to position ourselves, you know, on the very far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve.\nAnd so we've laid out what we know of and what we see ahead of us, certainly in the capital standpoint, but as the organization continues to execute and continues to look for ways to trade, translate the strategy into bottom line value, we find new opportunities and then we don't hesitate to go after those if they meet our criteria with respect to the advantages, and they are within our ability to effectively execute.\nSo I wouldn't say 2024 there's any different emphasis than there was in 2023. The project piece of it, frankly, that's the way the projects have been developed and kind of the work that's required to deliver those has led to that 2024 year of execution. But I wouldn't read more into that than just the scheduling of the projects.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nVery clear. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Bob.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat, thank you. Maybe if I could ask one. With the Denbury deal now closed, can you talk about what we might see over the course of the next year or two, particularly on the carbon capture business? Should we, should we start to see announcements or notable signs of acceleration or efforts on that side?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. I think the Denbury acquisition, just maybe a slight update on that first is we closed it. We've been going through the integration process and frankly continue to be very pleased with what we see as the opportunities to integrate that, with the work we're doing around our low carbon solutions business and carbon capture. So we see huge potential in terms of linking together all the opportunities to reduce emissions, high concentration emissions along the US Gulf Coast and along that pipeline system.\nThe team's doing a lot of work around developing the business there, a lot of work with potential customers around how we can help capture their emissions, and a lot of work around the operations and improving and growing the capacity of that pipeline. So all that's ongoing.\nMy expectation is with time, when we, as we negotiate the opportunities with customers, we'll see more and more deals that bring emissions into that pipeline. That's certainly the plan. But I would tell you we're very focused on building this business for the long term. If you think about what we're trying to do there with respect to addressing the risk of climate change and significantly reducing emissions for third parties, that's a business that doesn't exist today anywhere in the world. We're trying to make sure that as the first mover here, that we establish a very strong foundation for business that we expect to be around for decades to come.\nAnd so my guidance to the team is while we want to move quickly to reduce emissions and to get customers and to grow the volume of emissions we're reducing, we don't want to do that and sacrifice the value opportunity here. And so we're striking that balance. And I think what you'll see happen is we'll bring on customers and grow that business in a way that is a value accretive and generates the returns that we need for the capital in that business.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head of Energy Transition Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question on gas realizations because they were just well ahead of at least what we had modeled using the rules of thumb and the portfolio mix you put out before. So is it just a case of the trading contribution coming into that number or is there something else driving that? And then just one quick clarification on the underlying cash flow from operations. Again, that was ahead of where the earnings beat would have suggested it would have been. So is there anything one-off in nature in the CFFO number that we should be aware of for Q4? Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I'll let Kathy address the cash flow thing, and I'll just say from a gas realization standpoint.\nI don't think there's anything unique in terms of what was realized as we went through the quarter. Obviously, we've been growing our trading business, and that is going to manifest itself in our results. We're going to see that in our energy business. We're going to see that in our gas businesses. So that will continue to kind of. And as volatility changes and opportunities in the market change, we'll see that kind of ebb and flow. But we expect to see, with time, a continued growth, structural improvement in the earnings with the work that we're doing in the trading space. And then, I think, you know, quarter-on-quarter, we're going to see changes in mix as we move across the quarters.\nAnd so we'll see some variation there, but I don't, I wouldn't put anything structurally other than the trading work that we've been doing with into our realizations. I'll hand it to Kathy for any other comments on that, and the cash flow.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYep. And so I'll just speak specifically to cash flow from operations, and I think you're referencing the quarter, but I'm happy to talk about the quarter and the year. You know, our cash flow from operations, if you look at the quarter, was $13.7 billion. If you exclude working capital, we would have been at $15.9 billion. You're mentioning a beat relative to the street. And so was there anything unusual going on? As I look at people's models, I think sometimes they struggle to get depreciation and amortization right. So that's the only thing I'm going to speak to. And when we have a quarter where we're taking impairments, then we get an increase kind of in terms of the non-cash add back that flows through to cash flow from operations. And we obviously took an impairment in the quarter.\nSo that's my best guess as to anything that might be nuanced otherwise. No, nothing particularly unusual going on.\n\nBiraj Borkhataria\n\nGlobal Head of Energy Transition Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay, understood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHello. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to come back to CapEx if possible, just because when the organization's performing so well as it is, it feels like there's always going to be opportunities to pull something forward or for people throughout the organization to kind of pursue their incentives and spend a bit more. And obviously this is something that's been a topic in the industry for a long time. And so particularly like as we look at your Permian results, it looks like your 23 wells are still improving and everything's getting better. So I guess the question is, you know, how do we think about this with respect to your planning when it feels like there's always going to constantly be opportunities for you to add kind of nickels and dimes to CapEx to do some quick hit high return opportunities. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning, Sam. I would, I guess I'd take exception to the characterization that you've laid out there. It's not a function of the organization throwing additional nickels and dimes. You know, we have pretty focused work programs to drive value here. And frankly, any discussion about spending additional money or making additional investments above and beyond what we plan for has to come to the management committee. And so we've got pretty tight controls around making sure we understand what's the value proposition, how unique is the value proposition.\nThis is not something we just turn loose to the organization, and they start throwing on money when they see the opportunities to do that. So that's, I think, you know, the characterization that it's hard to hang on to this. I would think I would point to the success that we've had to date, where we've delivered what is a very accretive advantage set of capital projects.\nI think our track record demonstrates that we are not about going after volume or going after marginal investment opportunities. These things have to be unique. The hurdle to get into the capital plan is pretty high. We have, if you look across the industry, we have a clear understanding of cost of supply. We know where we sit on the cost of supply curve. We know as new projects or opportunities come forward, we look at those in terms of where they sit from a competitive standpoint. They have to have a structural advantage. They have to be robust and resilient to the bottom of cycle conditions. If you lay all those conditions on, it's a fairly tight funnel that people have to get their spend through. And that doesn't change. That has not changed.\nSo I would just say if we spend additional money, that money is going to deliver more than what was in the base plan, frankly, because it's on the margin. And I'll come back to, at the end of the day, we're not judging ourselves by basing by hitting some number that we've given, or guidance that we've given, you know, from a year ago. We're judging ourselves on the ability to generate advantaged projects. And again, I just point you to the results that we were delivering.\nTo grow earnings on a compounded basis at twice what the nearest competitor has done or to grow cash flow from operations at twice what the next nearest competitor has done, doesn't come from investing in things that don't have the advantage that I just talked about. So I think our track record and the results that we're delivering demonstrate that the approach that we've taken here is working and we're not going to vary off of that approach.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nI'd just add one more comment, and that is, you know, we almost take for granted how many projects we've actually been able to pull forward and deliver, you know, either on time or ahead of time. Payara is a great example of that, that it was originally targeted to actually start up in 2024. We were able to pull it forward. We were then able to pull forward incremental well drilling in order to get that FPSO up to operating nameplate capacity in an extraordinarily short amount of time.\nI'd say this is one of the areas that really differentiates ExxonMobil from other companies. Our top, really top performance and execution. Pulling projects forward is always a positive economic decision, right? Because we're going to end up then getting the benefit of the profits from those projects sooner or later. So, you know, very much a decision that's aligned with driving value, which is what sits behind all of our decision making.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director of Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Hey. Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to get your take on the outlook for the chemicals market going forward. 2023 was a bit of a trough year. You know, some of the industry participants are saying maybe we're getting close to turning the corner. And that would be meaningful given all the underlying investments that Exxon has made in the chemicals business. So just wondering your view on potential for market improvement and seeing the full force of some of those investments come through.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. Good morning, Jason. Yeah, I think, you know, I would concur with your characterization of 2023 as being, you know, kind of at the bottom of the trough. It was definitely a challenging year, well below, I think, the bottoms of previous cycles. But I would say that we're quite proud of the fact that, you know, investments that we've brought on were earnings and cash positive in the bottom of the cycle, which frankly is exactly in line with, you know, I was just talking about the strategy that we have and the criteria that we require our projects that they have to be robust to bottom of the cycle conditions.\nIn the chemical business, we definitely demonstrated that, that the projects, the new projects that we've brought on that had some runtime in them are earnings and cash positive even in these very challenging conditions. So I think like many others in the chemical industry, we'd like to see us come out of the trough. And when we do, our expectation is the capital that we brought on will obviously be performing even better with better margins.\nI would say as well, with respect to turning points, we have seen some; we certainly saw in the fourth quarter some slight improvements. There's still a lot of capacity that's come on out there. We're still seeing reasonably good growth, particularly for ExxonMobil in our performance product category. We have set some pretty aggressive targets to grow our high performance, high value chemical products. And we're seeing that happen. So we feel really good about the pipeline and the development of our sales.\nAnd then the question is, when does the broader industry turn and you start to see margins improve? My expectation is 2024 might be marginally better than 2023, but we're not expecting significant change in the vector, but more of a gradual one as we work our way through all the supply that's come on in the recent years and some of the supply that will come on in 2024 and 2025.\nSo I think it'll be a gradual recovery, but frankly one that we feel very comfortable with based on the advantages that we have with our capacity, the advantages that we have with our footprint, and the flexibility we have to optimize on feed and products. So we're positioned for this kind of market. I think the results demonstrate that, and we're going to ride it and see where the market goes.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director of Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nBet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Good morning. Darren and Kathryn, want to ask about the trading operation. I think it seems like it's a very good trading year for you and a lot of your peers in Europe. Can you help us to maybe quantify that? What is the trading benefit for the year, whether in terms of millions of dollars or in terms of improvement in the return, and whether that you think that is repeatable? And after more than the last two or three years, what have you learned? Is there any that you will do differently going forward in your trading operation? And whether you see the Q1 optimization opportunity set, is it similar to what you've seen in the Q4, or is it getting worse or getting better? Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, thank you, Paul. And good morning.\nI'll give you a perspective and then let Kathy build on that. And maybe just to go back in time a little bit, you know, we talked about the trading opportunity within ExxonMobil for quite some time. I think there is some skepticism out there as to whether we could actually build that business. But the foundation of our trading operations is a function of the global footprint that we have, the span of the businesses that we have, the integrated nature of the businesses that we have that we felt like gave us a physical footprint and presence in markets all around the world to effectively trade on and to build a business from that footprint.\nAnd obviously, the perspectives and insights that come with operating that footprint in those mix of businesses, and that, I would say, as we've grown our trading capability on that premise, optimizing our assets, building on our assets, that it has proven to be very effective, that that strategy is bearing out, and that we see continued opportunity to grow that. And I think as we've talked about here, we were going to take a very measured approach, and we weren't in a hurry, we weren't going to rush through this. We're going to make sure that what we do is structurally sound, that we're not, and that we're managing the risk as well as capturing the rewards. And we've been doing that.\nSo 2023, I think, was off of the highs we saw in 2022 because of where the market's at, but still reflected, I think, very solid contributions based on the capabilities of the organization that we've been building, and we've got more to do there. My expectation is that you will see improved trading results embedded in our businesses because frankly, that trading organization's objective is to enhance the value of the business.\nWe don't want a trading organization that's competitive competing against the base business. We want a trading organization that's working with the base business to optimize value for the corporation, and they're doing that, and those earnings accrue to the businesses that they're trading on behalf of. But I'm very pleased with what we saw in 2023. Obviously the market and volatility is going to have a function, will function heavily or play a heavy function year in year in terms of what we actually deliver. But structurally we've got a really sound base that we're growing, and I think we're going to continue to see improvement in that space. Kathy, anything to add?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, the only other thing that I'd add to that is if you looked at our trading results on a year-on-year basis. Now in upstream, we were lapping kind of a big mark-to-market gain in 2022. Right. So that impacted our results and I've mentioned time and time again that quarterly results, especially as a result of that movement in mark-to-market, you know, we'll kind of ebb and flow and sometimes we get price timing nuances in the quarter. As we came to the end of this year, those price timing nuances that we saw in Q3 had fully unwound by Q4. So I think we start the year overall in a pretty good place.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nKathy, is there a number you can share in terms of what's the contribution for trading for the year?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSenior VP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nNo, we don't disclose that. I think actually all our peers have a pretty high sensitivity to just, you know, competitive sensitivity in terms of disclosing that number. But I think Darren put overall things into a good context, which is last year was record earnings for the company and it was record trading earnings. So we had a strong result this year in trading, but it was down a bit on a year-over-year basis. Then I mentioned specifically in upstream that we were lapping favorability in terms of mark-to-market favorable gain in 2022.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay, thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist\n\nMorning Darren and team. My question's on the Permian, specifically your continued record production to date. It appears, at least from what I'm seeing, going forward your pro forma Permian activity is likely to continue trending higher. And I'm just wondering, maybe Darren, how you'd respond to maybe any critics who suggest all US companies should instead maintain flat production in order to, you know, I guess appease Saudi and the others, maybe more so.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, well, thanks for the question. No, I would just tell you we're not going to run the business to appease an external.\nI think the way we look at it is, can we find it? It comes back to every dollar that we choose to invest and spend, do we see a return? Are we convinced that we're effectively spending that money and we're spending it efficiently? That's the criteria that we're using. That's the plans that we've built. We expect to grow our volumes in 2024 to about 650 kbd and then we're going to continue that growth through to the targets that we've laid out in 2027 of about a million barrels a day, close to a million barrels a day.\nSo that's the plan that we have; we're executing to that plan. As we've said before, year-on-year it's not straight rateable growth. It'll be lumpy growth. But over time it will average about 13%, and we haven't seen anything to date that would say that's going to change. Obviously as we bring Pioneer into the fold, we'll bring their production in and look to kind of optimize across that portfolio that both companies have. As we said before, once we close on that we'll come back out and have a spotlight where we share what the implications of bringing these two companies together, and the impact on our Permian production.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist\n\nYeah, it makes a ton of sense. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Lucas Herrmann of BNP Paribas.\n\nLucas Herrmann\n\nManaging Director and Head of Oil and Gas Equity Research, BNP Paribas",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks very much and have the opportunity to talk with you. Following on from the Permian question. Actually, Darren, when you were asked about the pace of growth in 2024 in the Permian, I think at the time of the capital budget release, one of the comments you made was, you know, a desire to build drilled uncompleted wells. And I just wondered whether you could talk a little bit around, you know, the concept of building inventory. You know, why the need, why put more wells into inventory? Is it very simply adding flexibility to the business in order to maintain a production profile going forward or what's the thinking? Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure, happy to do that. You remember correctly, we did say we were going to build some more DUCs and I would think about that. You use the right word, inventory, like any inventory that we have in the business, which is if you're optimizing what is a pretty complex, complex system of drilling, fracking, and managing simultaneous ops and how you schedule all that and how it interfaces with each other and the planning piece of it. You want to have a little bit of inventory that allows you to continue at a pace and manage around some of the complexities and potential conflicts that you have in developing the acreage.\nAnd you'll recall that what we are doing in the Permian and the Delaware in particular is this manufacturing approach where we're laying out these spines and then executing like a manufacturing organization down that. And so it is a very paced and continuum of work and production. There are constraints that you hit as you're doing that consistently across all that acreage. Having some DUCs available to us allows us to, when we run into an issue with what we're doing in the immediate vicinity, we have some other opportunities to continue the production. We use it like any other inventory.\nObviously the trick is to get that inventory level right. You don't want a bunch of capital sitting there that isn't earning its return. This, we think, we've got to an optimized level that allows us to keep a very efficient, I'd say, manufacturing process running versus a focus on production and production process.\n\nLucas Herrmann\n\nManaging Director and Head of Oil and Gas Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you, that's helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, and Company.\n\nJeoffrey Lambujon\n\nManaging Director, TPH & Co.\n\nMorning everyone. Appreciate the time going back to carbon capture. I was interested in the comment early on about the pilot plan and the potential to lower the costs of direct air capture. I imagine there are limitations on what you can share, just given, as you mentioned, the proprietary nature of the tech here. But with other key players in the energy space, particularly on the service side, exploring new technologies for this. Just thought it'd be great to get any commentary you can speak to on key learning so far from this pilot plan and the magnitude of potential savings, where you see the most opportunity to improve the cost structure, and what kind of capital investment that I guess the low carbon solutions business overall might involve over the near term.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure, I think, and you rightly so pointed out the proprietary nature.\nSo I will limit some of the details of what we're talking about there. But maybe just from a broader context standpoint, we're convinced that carbon capture is going to play a really important role in helping society meet its ambitions to get to net zero or to make certainly significant reductions in carbon emissions. I think it makes a lot of sense to rather than tear up and throw away the existing infrastructure and the industries that we have in place that are intensive energy users, that we find a way to deal with the problem, which is the emissions. And so I think carbon capture plays a role there.\nThe technology that we have today frankly wasn't developed for this application. It has a use and can be deployed today for high concentration streams. But as you move down the emissions profile and get to lower and lower concentrations of CO2 streams, the existing technologies challenge, and so it becomes very expensive for every ton of carbon that you reduce. So the challenge is use existing technology today for these high concentration streams where you can make the economics work, but then find a lower cost method to deploy for these less concentrated streams that still make it economic.\nThat's been the challenge that we're working on, recognizing that the existing technology was designed for a different purpose. We need a new technology here. We're trying to take advantage of the material science development things that have happened with materials with nanostructures. There's a lot of advances in technology since the existing technology was developed. There's a question of how can we better capture CO2 by using advances in the existing technology. We think we've come up with an opportunity to potentially do that. But it's early, early days like all these technology developments.\nAnd so we've built a pilot plant and we'll see and test out some of these new capabilities and test the cost effectiveness of capture. I would say our first step, we're looking to get about cost reduction, reduction of about half. But I would tell you that's still not enough. But if we can see a significant step change in that cost or a path to that cost reduction, that gives us hope that we can then continue to advance that and get it back get it down to something that is more competitive and then economic to deploy across the world if we can crack that nut. As I've said many times before, the holy grail in addressing emissions is direct air capture.\nAnd the challenge for the industry is to find ways to do that more cost effectively. And frankly, we're at the very early stages of the technology and the technology development. So whether we're successful or somebody else is successful, I feel like this is an area worth exploring. And I think our technology companies have got some great ideas, know how to scale things, know how to optimize not only materials but processes. And bringing all that together to see if we can make a step change here is the objective. And it's too early to judge, you know, how successful we'll be. But I certainly feel like we've got the capabilities and should be working hard to try to make advances here.\n\nJeoffrey Lambujon\n\nManaging Director, TPH & Co.\n\nGreat. Looking forward to your updates in the space there. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThanks, everybody, for joining our call today and for the questions you asked. We'll pose a transcript of the Q&A session on our Investor website later this week or early next week. Have a nice weekend, everybody. With that, we'll turn it back to the operator to conclude our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."

Today's call is being recorded. I'll now turn it over to Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please proceed, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Q3 2023 earnings call. We appreciate your joining the call today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President. This presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the Q3 earnings release which is posted in the same location shortly. Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from his presentation. Then we'll take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcements regarding Pioneer Natural Resources and Denbury, we've included additional information on slide 2 related to comments or information included in today's presentation. Please be aware that this presentation is not intended to be a solicitation of any vote or approval.\nDuring today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides which are posted on the website. Now please turn to Slide 4 for Darren's opening remarks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for joining us.\nToday we delivered another robust quarter of.\nEarnings, cash flow, and shareholder returns. Reflecting our ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained industry-leading performance. We reported $9.1 billion of earnings, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to the last quarter. While the market provided a bit of tailwind, our success was enabled by the continued strength of our operational performance which reflects the hard work of our people across the company. Whether it's continuing to drive efficiency, maintenance, and turnarounds, running at high throughputs and utilization rates, or delivering big projects at first quintile cost and schedule, the excellent work of our people underpins our results and sustains our drive to deliver industry-leading performance in everything we do. Their work is fundamentally strengthening the underlying earnings power of the company, establishing a strong foundation to deliver industry-leading results in any price environment.\nConsistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share the success of the.\nCompany with our shareholders.\nThis morning we were pleased to announce a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share. This year is our 41st consecutive year of annual dividend increases, a record that we're proud of and that we know.\nOur investors value highly.\nWe continue to strengthen our portfolio of businesses by investing in advantaged high return opportunities while divesting businesses that are no longer a strategic fit. During the quarter we closed on the sale of our Thailand refinery, bringing our year-to-date cash proceeds from asset sales to more than $3 billion. We followed this in October with the close of the refinery sale in Italy. Recently announced acquisitions are great examples of the 'and' equation meeting the world's needs for energy, essential products, and reducing emissions. Acquiring Denbury strengthens our position to economically reduce emissions in harder to decarbonize industries which today have limited practical options. We see the potential to drive strong returns with the capacity to reduce the nation's carbon emissions by 100 million tons per year.\nThat's 20 times our current CO2 offtake agreements with CF Industries, Linde, and Nucor, which by themselves could reduce CO2 emissions.\nBy an amount equivalent to replacing two.\nMillion cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles currently on US roads. We expect to close the transaction in early November with Denbury shareholders scheduled to vote next week.\nEarlier this month we signed an agreement to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in another all stock transaction. This combination will further strengthen our already advantaged upstream portfolio and create significant value for the shareholders of both companies. Together we will recover more resource more.\nEfficiently and with a lower environmental impact.\nWe plan to accelerate Pioneer's Permian net zero ambition by 15 years and fully leverage their advances in water recycling. This deal is a win any way.\nYou look at it.\nGood for our shareholders, good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for US energy security. Neil will say more about the benefits of the transaction in a few moments. We're also continuing to drive profitable growth organically in energy products. We achieved the highest Q3 refinery throughput on record, driven by our Beaumont refinery expansion. At a time of strong demand and low inventories, this project is providing 250,000 b/d of much needed new.\nCapacity to the market.\nIn addition, we recently started up our Baytown Chemical expansion which grows volume and improves mix. It provides 750,000 tons per year of new performance chemical capacity, including 350,000 tons of linear alpha olefins, marking our entry into this growing market. We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance with earnings of $9.1 billion and cash flow from operations of $16 billion. These results reflect the structural earnings improvements we've delivered over the past several years as we've improved our mix of assets and driven significant structural cost reductions while maintaining our focus on industry-leading safety and reliability.\nWe lowered our structural cost by $9 billion since 2019, beating our plan and expect to deliver additional savings in Q4. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our base operations including enhancing our maintenance and turnaround processes, strengthening our digital capabilities, and optimizing our supply chain. Our year to date production of 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels per day is on track. With our full year guidance.\nCapEx investments of $18.6 billion year to date are on plan. We expect 2023 CapEx to finish the year at the top end of our guidance range as we continue to invest in high return advantage projects, our top priority for creating long term shareholder value.\nAs always, we remain focused on sharing the company's success with our shareholders. We delivered $8.1 billion in shareholder distributions in Q3, $3.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nThanks, Darren. Good morning, everyone. As we shared with you recently, Pioneer is arguably the best Permian pure play company with the largest undeveloped Tier 1 inventory in the Midland Basin. Pioneer's premier asset base is matched by the quality of its workforce. Its employees are innovative, hard-working, and possess a deep knowledge of unconventional operations in the Permian. When you combine these attributes with our technology and industry-leading operational capabilities, we're confident we can unlock far more value together than either of us could do alone. We expect synergies of approximately $1 billion before tax annually beginning in the second year post-closing and an average of about $2 billion per year over the next decade driving double-digit returns.\nThis transaction not only strengthens our current position, but it also transforms our portfolio, increasing our exposure to short cycle and low cost to supply liquids in the United States. Based on our initial assessment, we expect our combined Permian production to increase to approximately two million oil equivalent barrels per day by the end of 2027. Downstream, this merger also increases the integration between high value light Permian crude and our premier refinery and chemical footprint on the US Gulf Coast. Finally, we said many times that we're working to solve the and equation, providing the energy and products society needs and reducing emissions, both ours and others. This transaction reflects both parts of our commitment. We will increase our Permian production with plans to accelerate Pioneer's net zero plan to 2035 from 2050 and decrease our combined Permian emissions. With that, I'll pass it to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you Neil. We have two quick announcements to share with you.\nFirst, please mark your calendars for our.\nAnnual corporate plan update scheduled for Wednesday, 6 December at 9:00AM Central Time. Jerry and Kathy are going to provide formal remarks and take live questions from our sell-side analysts. Second, please keep an eye out for our 2024 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in.\nMid-December, and with that, we're going.\nTo begin our Q&A session. Please note we continue to ask analysts to limit yourself to one question as a courtesy to others. However, please remain on the line in case we need any clarification. Operator, please bring us a first call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing star followed by the digit 1 on your touch-tone phone.\nThe first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resource Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning and thanks for the update. The first question for me is on the Permian here and slides 17 to 19 are interesting and incremental. I was wondering, Neil, if you could take a moment to walk us through it. And this is in the context of some of the investor feedback we've gotten around the transaction, is folks are looking for a little more clarity on the top line synergies that are going to come from better productivity. Thank you.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, good morning Neil. What we outlined in the slide with the earnings release is really the basis of what I always describe as real quantifiable synergies that have created the deal space for this transaction. These synergies are already demonstrated in our existing operations either in the Delaware or the Midland. It does not include a pipeline of new technologies that are either in the early stages of deployment or close to deployment. So by applying what we've already demonstrated, we're confident we can recover an additional 1 billion oil equivalent barrels more than either Pioneer or industry could have demonstrated with their existing performance. And the charts we highlight two areas. One, industry's move to cube development. Moved to cube development to get the higher net present value. We were the pioneer in that. That's obviously to avoid the parent-child impact.\nThe top chart on there shows that we've been drilling cubes since 2020, 100% in the Midland. You can see that over the period, Pioneer has moved to 100% cubes as well. But in 2022, when we're both.\nDeveloping 100% cubes, you can see we've got equivalent recovery rates, but we're at notably lower quality acreage, lower quality resource. Equivalent recovery at lower quality resource. When we look for truly comparable acreage, and that's really, really important because generalizations can lead to misleading results. In the bottom, we talk about adjacent Martin County where us, Pioneer, and one of our other peers are drilling the same 10,000 lateral cubes. You can see we get a 20% higher recovery. That's where we're targeting. All targeting the same interval. These are Middle Spraberry to Wolfcamp C in similar proportions. What varies and what's the difference is the stacking and landing zones. What varies is the optimal well spacing that we are delivering, which includes things like vertical orientation. Just one final point on that, Neil.\nIn terms of recovery, it's not just about how you deliver cubes. When you've got better recovery, when you've got better capital efficiency, it gives access to economically developing what we would describe as secondary ventures. Now as you recall, like the Wolfcamp C and like Jo Mill extension. In addition, obviously we have other techniques that we too keep confidential, which gives us this higher level of recovery.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resource Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you, Neil.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nHi.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGood morning. When you talk about your two million.\nBarrels per day, initial sort of view of where production from the combined entity.\nCan get to in 2027, how do.\nI think about the gating factor? Is that a fixed rig or activity or CapEx program, and the volume is an outcome, or is that a volume target, and you'll adjust activity down as more synergies come through?\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, Bob. Neil, again I want to be clear. We don't have a volume target. We have a volume outcome, and that's really, really important. For our basis, we've talked about an outcome being a million barrels a day by the end of 2027, based on our Delaware Basin and Midland Basin. Based on our initial assessment of Pioneer's plans, obviously we've had access to that through the due diligence process. We see that with similar capital spending as Pioneer have today. When you can equate that to similar number of rigs, we would anticipate that Pioneer's production under ExxonMobil and Pioneer's combined operations would also get to a million barrels a day by the end of 2027. If you add current production in the Midland Basin from both Pioneer and ExxonMobil today, it's already at a million barrels today. It's really important, though.\nVolume is an outcome. We're striving for value. That's why we focus on the cube development. But I would say the basis is consistent with existing capital spending that Pioneer making today. We do anticipate, as I've just outlined, improvements in recovery. We do anticipate improvements in capital efficiency basing on the synergies that we outlined the earnings release, but that's not really built into that outlook of a million barrels a day from Pioneer Operations.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nVery clear. Thank you.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to stick with upstream. Take advantage of having you on the call here, Neil, and ask about Guyana. The slides noted that production is now coming in ahead of plan for the full year, a little bit better than your full year target. And part of that is the Payara startup. Part of that seems to be debottlenecking. I wanted to just focus on the debottlenecking opportunity. Could you walk us through how much uplift you've realized so far versus nameplate, how much is left, and then the repeatability of this outperformance as we look at the additional FPSOs that are set to start up over the next few years.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, thank you. I mean, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing in Guyana. I mean, let's just start with the two boats that are in our operation today. Liza 1 or Destiny had a nameplate capacity of 120,000 b/d. We're consistently running that at about 150,000 b/d. Liza 2 Unity was a 220,000 b/d capacity, and we've been running that consistently above 240,000 b/d. So those two combined are getting close to 400,000 b/d, which is quite a bit above. And this comes from, I would just say good operational performance. You look at every aspect of the operations, you tweak them, you push them, and you can get more and more out. Now we're starting up Payara, which is 220,000 b/d nameplate capacity. You know, we would hope we would expect to have a similar type of uplift.\nThere is no reason to think that we wouldn't. But we have to start that up. The plan is to start that up in the middle of November. That would give us a combined nameplate capacity of 560,000 barrels a day. But obviously with the first two boats running more like 400,000 barrels, we'll expect to be in excess of 600,000 barrels a day of production. Just to add to that, you know, we got three more boats in the pipeline, as you're aware. All three of the boats in the pipeline, that's Yellowtail, Uaru, and then Whiptail. These are all larger boats. They're all 250,000 barrels a day. Yellowtail and Uaru in construction. Whiptail. We've submitted the development plan to the government and you know, we would hope and expect to reach FID in 2024 for that.\nThat will give us a combined nameplate capacity of 1.2 million barrels/day at the end of 2027. But that doesn't include the uplift in performance, the production performance that we've got.\nOut of the first two boats.\nAnd you know, I mean, we certainly, our message to the organization is start it up safely, start it up on time each boat. That's what we'll do on Payara. And once we get settled, we'll try and follow the same protocols that we've done on the first two boats and strive to get maximum production out of the boat. And that's obviously good for the shareholders, it's good for the co-venturers, and it's even better for the country.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nI would add to Neil's comment, if you recall. You know, we brought all our projects organization together to make sure that we were leveraging the best capability in terms of development and designing these projects. We've also brought together our technology organizations, and the big benefit we have there is we're now leveraging not only the capacity that was in the upstream in terms of optimization and running these facilities, but we've got decades and decades of experience of people optimizing and running our chemical plants and our refinery facilities to squeeze out and optimize every piece of the production pipeline and make sure that we are at the design limits of the different equipment. That optimization, which has been kind of the lifeblood of the refining business, given the very narrow margins, has big payoffs when we apply it to the upstream facilities.\nSo there's an additional benefit just in terms of leveraging the broader organizational capability, which again has been part of our strategy from the very beginning, is to make sure that we're bringing to bear the best thinking across all over the corporation on the most important.\nFacilities and projects. This is certainly one of those.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nGood morning, everyone.\nDarren, also, forgive me, I'd like also.\nTo take advantage of. Neil, been on the call and follow.\nOn with a Guyana question if I may. Neela, if you don't mind me, I'd like to frame this question.\nLittle bit, because a couple years ago you talked about if the deeper resource potential proved to be as prolific as the original.\nYou know, targets that you had in the area, you could look to double your resource potential from 10 at that time you had announced, you know, potentially significantly larger.\nYou haven't updated that resource number in a while. Now you've had Lancetfish.\nLooks like fine tooth is in the.\nQ based on your EIS submissions to Guyana. But yet you still talk about production capacity and not production.\nSo, my question to you is with.\nCapability of obviously keeping these boats full for an extended period of time, what do you ultimately see as the production capacity, the production capacity or, sorry, actual production as opposed to capacity trajectory through.\nThe end of the decade at this point.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, thanks, Doug. I mean, there's probably two, two parts to that question. One is exploration and then one is production and capacity. Let me just handle exploration first. You know, we've had, as you're aware, three discoveries this year, including Lancetfish 2, which is the most recent one. We continue to integrate those results both of exploration and appraisal drilling. And we're going to update that resource base when we see it as a significant change. You know, our program of exploration and appraisal continues. And the way I like to frame it is in the southeast corner of the Stabroek Block. We're continuing to appraise around our discoveries and that will take a lot of work and a lot of activity.\nYou know, we have six drillships in the basin, and they're in development, appraisal, and exploration drilling. In addition to all that appraisal drilling that we're doing in the southeast part of the block, we're looking for what I would describe as anchor prospects further to the north and further to the west.\nWe continue to look and we probably got order of magnitude 3, what I call true wildcats or exploration targets, looking for anchor wells in the next 10 to 12 months, something like that. That can change based on results of either the appraisal or the exploration drilling. So you know, we're going to update when we see something meaningful and when we see something significant. We've been very clear that we had six FPSOs in the pipeline. They are firm and I've just one of the previous questions outlined all of those. Indeed they will have a capacity and you strive to keep them full all the time. As you know Doug, that one of the beauties about the Stabroek Block is the density of the resource and the proximity of these boats which gives that potential for tiebacks well into the future.\nBut the water cut will increase as everybody knows in deep water. So we constantly look, we like to talk about capacity, and we optimize as we go and we will increase the production versus the nameplate capacity as we go. And so that's why I think what we can be firm on is we will have six boats by the end of 2027; they will have a nameplate capacity of 1.2. And obviously we will strive to keep them as full of liquids or of oil as we can over that period. I mean I think as we get closer and closer to 2027, obviously we'll update those numbers.\nDoug.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAppreciate the full answer.\nNeil, thanks so much.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you. We're going to keep Neal busy this morning. Another one on the Pioneer disclosure. Appreciate the incrementals, Neil. I guess it sounds like from your previous comments the million barrel a day target and output is still there for the legacy Exxon position. And you're thinking about the additive from Pioneer. Can you talk a little bit about as you integrate the two assets, are you assuming some high grading around some of the higher quality acreage?\nDo you envision?\nPrioritizing more activity on one asset versus the other? Are you still kind of thinking about them as two separates, and then also maybe you could just talk a little bit about assumptions around acreage, bolt-ons, or any positions as well. Is there a lot of work to do in terms of extending some of this lateral length that you're talking about? Thanks very much.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, yeah. Well, I mean, first of all, I would say it's very early in the process. Of course, you know, we've done the due diligence. We're into transition now. I think it's very important to make the point. Pioneer is a very, very capable organization. They've demonstrated that. What we're really excited about is the combination of these two organizations. Pioneer has a deep, deep understanding of the Midland Basin. As we've talked about it, this is absolutely in the fairway of Tier 1 quality resource, and Pioneer has done an exceptional job at developing that resource. From our side, we've got a whole range of different operating techniques, development plans, and technologies, and it's the integration of those that we're most excited about. And everything we've seen in the initial transition work would suggest all of that is correct.\nIf you just look at the acreage position and you look at where Exxon are and ExxonMobil are and Pioneer are, obviously it gives an opportunity for both high grading the inventory and including bolt-ons. And I have to say that Scott Sheffield and his organization have done an extraordinary job bolting on and increasing their acreage in the basin. And they have a very, very capable land organization, and we look forward to, to working with those folks. So I think it's a combination that's going to be most powerful in developing that resource.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I just add to what Neil said. If you look at what we've been doing over the last six years, it's really been around integrating our organizations, consolidating them, and making sure that we're concentrating like capabilities into the same organization. That is paying huge dividends. This is no different. The intent is to fully integrate the Pioneer organization and people into our business. My expectation is we'll bring a lot of advantages to their acreage, but at the same time, we expect their people to bring a lot of advantages to other parts of our business, including what we're doing in the Delaware. And so our whole strategy is really around the value you create by taking experts in areas and getting the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that. So there won't be a separate approach here. It'll be one.\nI think what you're seeing today, Dan's point, the fact that we're at a very early stage, but as we get together and work through the plans and the development, it'll be one seamless, integrated organization and plan.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nSteve, just one small addition to illustrate that I've talked before, that we have a basin-wide remote operations center in Houston where we control all our operations in Houston. That's drilling, that's fracking, that's field operations, that's methane tracking, methane emissions tracking as well from one central control center in Houston. Obviously our plan would be to bring in the whole Pioneer operations in time to have one central organization. What that gives you is it gives you all that competency, all that expertise applied to the whole of the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin from one central control center.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nThanks, Stephen.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. Keeping with the upstream theme here, I'd like to dig into the, I guess call it a slight transition here, the high value added or high margin liquid barrels. So specifically, you know, kind of the common 100,000 barrels a day higher versus 2022 as gas has declined and or been sold and the liquids have grown. But as you think about the change out to 2027, the growth in Guyana, the growth in the Permian, and we compare that to where you were say in 2019, how do you think about the sort of total value added liquid barrels, the impact on margins, the impact on returns? Like what's the right way for us to think about the transition of the company over roughly that eight year period?\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nWell, Roger, Neil, again let's just park the Pioneer acquisition for the start for the moment and just talk about our existing plans as ExxonMobil. And you're back in 2018 and 2019. I talked about the strength of our developments that we had in the pipeline, and obviously they were headlined by Guyana and by.\nThe Permian. And what I said at the time is what you will see is an increase in the percent of liquids in our portfolio, and a reduction in the percent of dry gas of the total. And if I outlook to 2027, we will go from something sub 65% liquids to something around 70% liquids in our portfolio in 2027, and 15% or thereabouts of liquefied natural gas. So that takes us up to 85%. I would call liquids index, obviously 80% of our LNG sales index to Brent or to crude oil. That's a big transition, but it's driven by the quality of those resources, primarily in the Permian and Guyana. And we're going to be adding onto that, of course, the programs we have developed. We have in LNG in Papua New Guinea, and then in Mozambique at the end of the decade.\nI just had one other comment. If you take the liquids and the LNG, which takes us to 85% liquid indexed in 2027, of the gas that remains, 7% of that is associated gas. So, in other words, gas associated with liquids production. So you can see that we'll be in the order of magnitude of 7 or 8% of dry gas in our portfolio at that time. And that's pre the Pioneer acquisition.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I'd just add to that, Roger, if you just step back and think more conceptually around the strategy and what we're trying to. Every one of our business is focused on moving to the left hand side of the cost of supply curve so that we remain robust to any period in the commodity cycle, and making sure that we're positioned competitively versus those everyone else in the industry. And so that drive over time to reshape the portfolio continues to move our collective production to the left and to lower cost, which at the same end, at the same time adding higher value barrels, we're lowering cost and increasing revenue. And so that's where the kind of value game is getting played out. And that's the work that we've been doing. And that's the high grading that you've seen in the portfolio and the improvements in structural costs.\nWe mentioned in the top of.\nThe meeting that we've actually achieved the $9 billion in structural costs this quarter, third quarter, so a quarter ahead of what our initial plans were. Expect to see more in the fourth quarter. As we go forward with the changes that we've been making in the organization continuing, we're going to continue to deliver more structural cost savings. The whole strategy is around making sure that we have the best portfolio and the most resilient portfolio so that we can basically be successful irrespective of the commodity price environment that we're in and that we're versus others in the industry. That is the strategy. You see that playing out certainly in the upstream, but you also see.\nIt's playing out in the downstream where.\nWe've been high grading our assets there and playing out in our chemical business where we continue to bring on units that produce high performance products. So that strategy is manifesting itself in each of our businesses. And then I'll just add, and on that same philosophy underpins what we're doing in low carbon solutions. As we build out that business and position ourselves for the long term. It's making sure that every investment that we're making, every value chain that we're creating, that Dan and his team have a clear view about where that will sit in the cost of supply curve or you can think of it as cost of abatement curve and making sure that we're going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Royall of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my question's on the CapEx. Could you maybe help us bridge the top end that you're guiding to now for this year versus maybe the midpoint? It's a tight range, so not super material, but just any color there would be helpful. And then I know you'll give your update in December, but is there any color you can give us directionally on what you're thinking of for next year on the legacy business prior to layering in Pioneer, just anything on the moving pieces for CapEx next year would be great. Thank you.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure.\nSo I would say nothing really unusual going on in CapEx. As you stated, it was a pretty tight range to start with. Obviously with the focus on us looking to ensure that we're investing in advantaged high return.\nThat's exactly what we're delivering. So I would characterize this as updated guidance that's pretty consistent with our plans, and we can give you a further update when we get to that corporate plan discussion later on in December. But we feel very good about our overall execution. As Darren mentioned earlier, you know, we're bringing projects online at a cost and a schedule that's typically within the top. So we feel really good about our capabilities and our execution and our ongoing focus with our highest priority ensuring that we're executing great projects with high returns for our shareholders.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I might just add to that, you know, as we think about the CapEx, we provide that range because we recognize going into the year that things move around a bit and as we prosecute the plan, prosecute the plan, that with time we find additional opportunities until things move around. If you look at where we're at through Q3, we are right on our plan. And so as we move forward, we're going to continue to do the things that we had planned to do last year. But I would say we're always looking for opportunities to build on the value proposition. If we see it, we're going to go after. We're not going to constrain ourselves artificially to guidance range if we find an opportunity set.\nTo date things are moving pretty consistent with where we thought we were going to be, and frankly, as we look out going forward, continue to see a very consistent set of opportunities that we're going to prosecute. I think the one change that we'll spend more time talking about in low carbon solutions is that as that business matures and we establish, I'd say, an advantaged position, there are a lot of opportunities coming our way. So we're working our way through those opportunities, making sure that we focus on the highest priority ones, the ones that generate the most value and are competitive in our portfolio. And we'll talk more about that as we get into the plan release.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director of Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nA lot's happened in the past few months, but about three months ago there was a handful of news articles about Exxon's lithium endeavors and I just wanted to get an update on that.\nAre you still drilling in the Smackover for lithium?\nAre you exploring potential processing unit there? How have things trended the past few months? Do you kind of expect that?\nTo figure into your growth plans here over the next five years? Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure, I'll take that. I think just stepping back and maybe setting the context of what we're trying to do, I'll call it, in the transition space and frankly more broadly is go back to the fundamental of what are our key technology competencies and capabilities and then what businesses lend themselves to those capabilities where we can carve out an advantage and produce the products society needs. And so rather than chase what I would say is the current narrative or the current conventional wisdom as to what the world's going to need is focus first on what we can fundamentally contribute and bring an advantage to and therefore generate returns higher than the rest of industry and then figure out how those advantages apply themselves to, to what the world needs.\nObviously, lithium is an important part of the transition going forward in the electrification and the need for batteries and storage of power and energy. So we've looked at that space and clearly with the opportunity to Smackover and the ability to drill, extract the lithium from the brine water and reinject that, it's got much, much lower environmental impact than the current production process for lithium. It fits very well with our capabilities and cost of supply curve. It's very competitive, so it looks attractive. And we, and the challenge that we've been given to Dan and his team is to develop a business plan where that becomes the material with respect to what ExxonMobil and ExxonMobil's portfolio and effectively competes for capital. That's looking as Dan and his team.\nDevelop that concept in that potential business, that's looking more and more promising. And we see an opportunity to really leverage the things that we're pretty good at in the base case. And it's very synergistic with our traditional businesses. So I think when we, when we come out and talk about the plan, we'll talk more about where we see the lithium business going. But it looks fairly promising at this stage. And I would just say, you know, the aperture's wide open. I think for a long time we've been characterized as an energy company and that almost discounts what is one of the world's largest chemical businesses, which we feel pretty good about. And it comes back to this fundamental.\nCapability of managing and transforming hydrogen and.\nCarbon molecules to products that the world needs and leveraging our capabilities. Lithium fits into that along with our other businesses in biofuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage. We'll continue to develop those. Again, as I said earlier, seeing that opportunity space and the opportunity to generate high return projects looking more and more promising. I would expect that to be part of the portfolio going forward.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director of Energy Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat.\nThat's really helpful.\nThanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. Maybe one follow up on some of the earlier Permian conversation on the, I mean, you were always known as developing your side of the Permian on a very long-term plan. You built out a lot of infrastructure early on. On the infrastructure side, as you think about this post Pioneer transaction on infrastructure, do you have the combined infrastructure in place that you need to arrive at the 2 million barrels a day of combined production? Will this require any additional infrastructure spend or any shift around and how you think about things versus previously anticipated, and maybe just any comments on whether you see any potential bottlenecks in the Basin over the next few years?\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, Ryan. Neil, I'll take that question. I think as you're aware, yeah, there is a big difference between the Delaware.\nThe Midland Basin.\nMidland Basin has got far more mature infrastructure, and I would say that Pioneer has done an exceptional job in both developing, acquiring, and contracting both infrastructure to exit product and for water. It's quite a difference versus the Delaware. Of course in the Delaware we had to put that infrastructure in place. We did it at scale. We built this large central processing facility called Cowboy. We currently have a capacity there of about 250,000 barrels a day of crude and about 400 mcfd of gas. We plan to expand that in Midland. Most of that infrastructure already exists. There is always going to be incremental investment, but nothing like the scale, Ryan, that we have seen in the Delaware. And I feel very good about the infrastructure we put in place in the Delaware. We made that investment up front.\nWe talked about it in 2018 and 2019, and we're clearly benefiting from that investment that we made now. Quite a contrast in the Midland.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I would add to that if you go back in time, as we were looking at the integrated value chain, we were certainly focused on the molecules that we were producing in the Permian. But we also recognized there was an opportunity for us to take advantage of the geographic locale and the proximity to our facilities in the Gulf Coast to optimize broader Permian production. So we built the logistics systems, the pipeline systems, the capability within our facilities to manage that. And so what we're now going to be bringing into the portfolio in the Midland fits very well with this broader play of an integrated value chain and making sure that we're maximizing the value of those molecules for our own facilities.\nAs we said early on, when we first introduced this steel, that piece of the equation, which we believe there is a value opportunity on, in terms of better managing the molecules through the whole from end to end, from the crude clear through to the finished products. We believe there's additional opportunity there. We got to get in and work through the details of that. My view is that additional upside to what we've been talking about, the one I feel really good about, and one that, frankly, we anticipated early on by making sure that we built the capacity ahead of actually needing it for our own molecules. We're in a very good position there.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nRyan, I didn't answer your question. Do we anticipate any bottlenecks? The answer to that is based on what we have seen so far during the transition work and the due diligence, the answer is no, we don't see any bottlenecks in getting to the production levels that we anticipate.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for the time. Maybe for you, Kathy, just my question is, on shareholder return, looks like you paid out a bit over 100% of free cash flow following the prior quarter. I think you were closer to even higher than that, maybe about 118%. I'm just wondering, when you think about shareholder return, will you continue to lean into the buybacks as you look in the out years or maybe just get a little bit of a color? I think I understand kind of your role, your thoughts on the dividend side. So maybe I'm asking a bit more on shareholder on the share buybacks going forward.\nThank you.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure.\nI'm happy to take that. So if you look at our overall free cash flow results for the quarter, it was just under $12 billion at $11.7 billion, and we paid out $8.1 billion to shareholders, and that was split between $3.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in the share repurchase program. In fact, in the quarter, our cash balance actually went up $3.4 billion, and we ended the quarter at $33 billion. So I think you can see that in the quarter we were in fact well under 100% in terms of what we paid out, which is what enabled us to grow our cash balance and strengthen our balance sheet even further. You know, when you look overall at our approach to capital allocation, you know, our priorities continue to be the same.\nFirst and foremost, let's make sure we're investing in advantaged projects, right, that are differentiated and drive high returns for our shareholders. We do that both organically and, as you've seen recently, inorganically as well, making sure we're maintaining a really strong balance sheet. We need that ultimately; at some point the cycle will turn against us and that balance sheet will be there for us to lean into and being balanced in our approach as to how we share the success of the company and those rewards with our shareholders. And I think you can continue to see that balance coming through between dividends and share repurchases. We're looking to be more consistent in our share repurchase program. Again, I think you're seeing that we continue to say we're on track to execute $17.5 billion of share repurchases this year.\nWe'll complete that before the end of the year. We already have a program in place, a similar program in place for 2024. We're trying to get that balance right. It's important that we continue to make and maintain a strong balance sheet that can carry us through the cycles.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nThank you, [Kathy].\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, Neil. The industry in the Permian. Whether it's for emission reason or for cost efficiency, seems to move and trying to electrify the operation as much as we could.\nCan you share with us that where is Exxon in that journey?\nHow far are you in terms of?\nElectrified your operation in the Permian? And when you're comparing to Pioneer, I don't know whether you have information that you can share and whether that you.\nGuys are ahead of them, or that this will be part of the 2 billion of the synergy benefit, or that if you're going to do more aggressively on that, this is going to be on top.\nThank you.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, thanks, Paul. Good to hear from you. From our perspective, you know, we have, I think, 17 rigs running right now in the Permian. All of those rigs are electrified. So we're 100% on rigs, and we're working on fracs right now. I think we have one electric frac out of six frac crews running in the Permian. This is all part of our drive to get to Permian net zero that we've said we will get to by 2030. Our plans are in place for that, and we're on schedule for it. I mean, our program goes as simple as this. You have to reduce methane emissions. You know, we're well on track with reducing methane emissions. We have no routine flaring in the Permian now. We've replaced over 6,400 pneumatic devices. So you eliminate or you reduce methane emissions, then you electrify your operations.\nAs I just described, we're a long way down the road in terms of electrification and then we have to secure renewable electricity for those.\nRigs and frac crews. That's the program we're working on. In terms of Pioneer. I don't have those numbers for Pioneer in terms of where they are on electrification, but what we have said is that we're going to advance Pioneer's target to go to net zero from 2050 to 2035, so 15 years sooner than anticipated. That will follow that same protocol, that same process of reducing methane, electrification, and then securing renewable electricity.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil",
    "content2": "Yeah, and I would add to that. I think, you know, Scott and the team at Pioneer have been. This has been an area of focus for them, and I know they've worked hard to drive those down. The advantage that we bring is we've got a large organization, more resources, we've got a technical organization that has been leaning into this space and working, you know, broadly with the industry and other organizations to develop the technology to better measure, better manage methane. Neil talked about the central organization that we put in place to kind of monitor everything that's happening out in the unconventional space and make sure that we're responding in real time to things that we're seeing through this centralized operating center.\nBringing the Pioneer portfolio into that center and then allowing us to apply a lot of the work that frankly our scale and size has allowed us to advance, I think is going to make a big improvement in what we're doing with Pioneer just by bringing additional capability there. I think the culture and the mindset is already in place. We're now going to bring some additional resources and tools to apply it. So my expectation is that we're going to see, we're going to raise the game here just because we're bringing some additional capabilities, support what was already, I think, a very important focus for the Pioneer organization.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you.\nNeil, just the saving from your the electrification is already built into that $2 billion synergy benefit?\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I mean, in terms of the synergy benefits, I mean, as you know and we've talked about many, many times, you know, it's not just about the cost of the rig, it's about the quality of the rig and the performance of the rig. But electrification of those rigs doesn't really impact that. The electrification of all of those facilities is built into our plans going forward.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. And I would say our drive to bring their net zero commitment forward by 15 years, we've also built that into our thinking around, and get net synergies there. So we've comprehended the additional effort required to improve the emissions profile and bring their net zero ambitions forward. So all that's netted with our synergy numbers. Yeah.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Silverstein.\nExcuse me.\nJosh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nHead of Energy Research, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nHead of Energy Research, UBS\n\nOn the Pioneer acquisition. Good morning. On the Pioneer acquisition call, you had mentioned that the inventory of the combined companies in the Permian was around 15 to 20 years. Was just curious how that may be split between the Pioneer asset and your Delaware asset. And does it contemplate the accelerated growth rate you previously outlined? Longer laterals or potential plateau?\nI'm just curious to get some more.\nDetails there, because there was a view of Pioneer having over 20 years of inventory. So any more details there would be helpful.\nThanks.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I think, Josh, it's early stages. I mean the numbers that we gave and you just referenced in our initial release is based on our understanding. We'd certainly say that the combined resource of the two companies is order of magnitude 16 billion oil equivalent barrels. That's 15 to 20 years life. Most of our resources, as you're aware, is in the Delaware side. Obviously, Pioneer is exclusive in the Midland side.\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, that's where it is. It's based on our early assessments.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nHead of Energy Research, UBS\n\nGot it. Well, is there any more details just on as far as, like, what your split may be of that 16 versus what theirs may be?\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I mean, a bit close. I would say in total, Exxon's is closer to nine. Pioneer's is closer to seven, is what I would say in total. But that's based on our initial understanding.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nFor the resource.\n\nNeil Chapman\n\nSVP, ExxonMobil\n\nFor the resource, yeah.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nHead of Energy Research, UBS\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question. Our final question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for taking the question at the end.\nI wanted to follow up on the.\nCapital allocation question and the dividend increase specifically. You know, we've talked a lot about this in the past. This dividend increase looks like it's roughly the same as the amount of the.\nShare repurchase in terms of percentage.\nI know you're issuing shares for Pioneer, but you've also got a pathway to a lot of upstream growth. Then downstream is growing, too, as we learned about in the Product solutions spotlight. You're running with sort of a significant operational cash surplus.\nOn a recurring.\nBased even before this growth. So just wondering about your thoughts on dividend growth going forward and if we are sort of through this period where you were tending to the balance sheet and the portfolio, and now some of this growth will translate to sort of a dividend CAGR that is in line with the operations. Thanks.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. So we have always said we're looking to ensure we have a dividend that's sustainable, competitive, and growing. I think the increase of $0.04 to the quarterly dividend is very reflective of that. Right. I think it also reflects the overall confidence that we have in the business and the underlying improvement in earnings power that we've seen over the last couple of years. I mean, by any metric, this was a really strong quarter. You know, whether you look at earnings, cash, shareholder returns, it was a very strong quarter. And we have a great degree of confidence in the business. So we increased the dividend a bit more than we did about a year ago.\nObviously, we have a cadence now of looking at the dividend in Q4 of the year, and that increase is very reflective of our confidence in the business and our underlying performance.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. I would just add to that, Sam. You know, obviously we view the dividend as a commitment and as we saw through the pandemic, even when things get tough, we work hard to make sure that we're continuing to deliver on that.\nCommitment to our shareholders.\nAnd so as we think about going forward and the volatility in the markets and the commodity cycle, we need to make sure that as we think about growth in the dividend, that we also think about sustainability and the ability to deliver on that commitment irrespective of what the market throws at us. So that goes into the equation as we think about that going forward.\nAnd when we've got additional cash that.\nWe want to distribute, we've always got buyback, which obviously, as Kathy said, we're looking to have a more consistent level of that as well. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Thanks for the question.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nYou're welcome.\nAnd thanks, everyone, for joining the call, answering your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q and A session on the investor website next week. We look forward to connecting with you again on 6 December for our corporate plan updates. With that, have a nice weekend, everyone. And I'll turn it back to the.\nOperator, to conclude our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."

Today's call is being recorded at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nAm.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Q2 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our slides, script, and earnings release are available in the Investor section of our website. In a moment, Darren will provide opening comments. Then we'll take your questions.\nIn conjunction with our recent announcement to acquire Denbury and related materials in this presentation, we've included additional information on slide two. During the presentation we'll make forward-looking comments. These are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide three. You may find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Please note that we have supplemental information at the end of our slides.\nNow let me turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to be conducting our earnings call from our Houston campus as of 1 July. Our corporate headquarters is now located at the campus alongside the senior managers of our businesses and centralized organizations. This is the first time in the company's history that the senior leadership team of the corporation is located on one site and represents a critical step in continuing the transformation of our business, enabling us to improve collaboration and alignment, and further leverage synergies across our integrated businesses.\nThe ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained industry-leading performance were clearly demonstrated in our Q2 results. We delivered earnings of almost $8 billion, two times higher than what we earned in Q2 2018 under comparable industry commodity prices.\nThat doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advantaged projects, and drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do. With these results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our people, starting with all those that made the move to Houston. I'm sure you know moves like this are not easy and that many personal sacrifices are made. I'm very thankful for all who did this. Their willingness to disrupt their lives for the benefit of our company is a testament to the dedication of our people whose commitment and hard work underpin all the improvements we are making.\nI hope our shareholders take comfort in this one small example of our people's commitment to the company and have confidence in the resolve to further strengthen our position as an industry leader in all that we do. Our achievements this quarter also demonstrate the progress we're making in solving the 'and' equation, meeting the world's need for energy and essential products, and reducing emissions, both our own and others.\nIn the Permian we set another production record. We remain on track for an overall growth in production of 10% this year. As I said last quarter, our growth won't be linear as we execute our development plans that balance and optimize capital efficiency, resource recovery, and production rates. Our priority will remain on driving value, not volumes. In Guyana, we achieved a record quarterly gross production rate of 380,000 barrels per day. Our team in Guyana continues to deliver excellent operating, environmental, and safety results while optimizing and growing production.\nIn fact, we see the potential to increase the combined gross capacity of these two FPSOs to above 400,000 barrels a day. With further debottlenecking, which is nearly 20% increase above the investment basis and a testament to the ingenuity of our people in the Gulf Coast, we continue to profitably grow our business.\nIn the Q2 we achieved mechanical completion of the Baytown Chemical Expansion. The project grows volume and improves mix with 750,000 tons per annum of additional performance chemical products. The Baytown Expansion is the final product solutions component of the Growing the Gulf Initiative announced in 2017. If you recall, the initiative committed to investments of $20 billion over 10 years to capitalize on the US's advantaged resources, economic growth, and strong regional support for our businesses and the jobs we create.\n11 of the 13 projects are up and running. The Baytown Expansion after product qualifications should begin contributing by Q4. In Golden Pass, the last of our Growing the Gulf projects should have its first train up at the back end of 2024.\nThe Growing the Gulf Initiative is another example of executing our strategy, investing in advantaged, high-value growth, and delivering on our commitments. Improving the earnings power of our businesses also requires divestments. In Q2 we completed the divestment of the Billings refinery. Including this sale, cash proceeds from divestments of non-strategic assets have totaled roughly $2 billion year-to-date.\nIn advancing our efforts to better leverage corporate scale and integration, we established three new centralized organizations in the quarter, consolidating activities previously embedded in each of our businesses. Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply Chain, and Global Trading. They're all off to a good start and have clear lines of sight to improve performance and lower cost.\nOur low carbon solutions business continues to make progress in building an advantaged low-cost, high-return business in capturing, transporting, and storing carbon. We announced the CO2 offtake agreement with Nucor, one of North America's largest steel producers. We signed an agreement to acquire Denbury, which will provide ExxonMobil with the largest owned and operated network of CO2 pipelines in the US.\nCombining Denbury's assets and experience with our capabilities will significantly accelerate and expand our ability to profitably help customers reduce their emissions and allow ExxonMobil to play an even greater role in a thoughtful energy transition. It significantly enhances our competitive position and offers a compelling customer proposition to economically reduce emissions in harder-to-decarbonize heavy industries which today have limited practical options.\nOf Denbury's 1,300 miles of CO2 pipeline, roughly 70% are in the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, one of the largest US markets for CO2 reduction and home to some of ExxonMobil's largest integrated refining and chemical sites. Nine of their 10 strategically located CO2 storage sites are also in this region. We believe the transaction synergies will drive strong growth and returns. A cost-efficient transportation storage system accelerates CCS deployment for both ExxonMobil and our third-party customers.\nIt supports multiple low carbon value chains including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia, and biofuels. Ultimately, we see an opportunity to create a CCS business with the capacity to reduce emissions across the Gulf Coast by up to 100 million tons per year. This transaction will help us do that at a lower cost and faster pace.\nIn fact, we see the potential for 1/3 of the opportunity being actionable in the near term, which takes us to our customers. Our latest offtake agreement extends our CCS customer base beyond industrial gas and fertilizers into steel. This project will tie into the same CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure we'll use to serve CF Industries located just 10mi from Nucor. Focusing on our efforts and investments in areas with concentrated sources of emissions allows us to capture the benefits of scale, reduce our spend per ton of CO2 captured, and improve returns.\nOur work with Nucor supports Louisiana's goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and it increases the total amount of CO2 we've agreed to transport and store for customers to 5 million metric tons per year, equivalent to replacing 2 million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles on the road in the US today. With the planned Denbury acquisition, potential reduction could be up to 20 times that, as demonstrated by these new developments.\nWe're continuing to make significant progress in our plans to lead industry in helping society reduce emissions. A major component of our improved earnings is a structural cost savings that we've achieved, currently at $8.3 billion. We remain on track to reach our target of $9 billion in savings by the end of this year. As we develop plans for future years, we're committed to finding additional savings.\nCash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion in the quarter, or $13 billion excluding the change in working capital.\nOur year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with the full-year guidance we shared last year as part of our corporate plan review. CapEx investments totaled $12.5 billion year-to-date. Also in line with our full-year guidance and consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continue to share our success with shareholders, distributing $8 billion in cash during the quarter, including $4.3 billion in share repurchases and $3.7 billion in dividends. Before we go to Q&A, I'll leave you with a few key takeaways from the quarter.\nFirst, our work to structurally improve earnings power is paying off, demonstrated this quarter as we doubled earnings versus a comparable price environment in the Q2 of 2018. Our reorganizations, aggressive investments in advantaged projects, and significant reductions in cost are driving value and improving our competitive position. We've made great progress and have a clear line of sight to much more. In the back half of this year alone, we expect to bring on two advantaged projects, Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further growing our capacity to generate industry-leading earnings.\nThe company's ongoing business transformation is giving the organization a better view of end-to-end value creation and focusing us on the highest value opportunities. Today, we are better positioned than ever to realize the value of our scale and the synergies from improving the integration of our businesses.\nFor the first time in our history, we have a corporate technology projects, trading, supply chain, and business solutions organization allowing us to apply the best solutions and talent to our biggest opportunities. Importantly, we are developing the most talented people in the industry, providing unrivaled opportunities to meet some of society's greatest challenges. The work is delivering exceptional results, driving industry leading returns on investments and growth in earnings and cash flow.\nThis in turn allows us to distribute cash to shareholders through share repurchases, and a sustained competitive and growing dividend while maintaining investments in industry advantage projects including investments in our low carbon solutions business. By leveraging the advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we are laying the foundation for a world scale, competitively advantaged low carbon business with industry leading returns. Planned acquisition of Denbury is a step in that direction.\nImproving our decarbonization proposition for customers while generating attractive returns.\nIn summary, we're pleased with the quarter, the progress it represents, and the improved earnings power of the company. We're confident that we have the right strategy with the right leadership, best people to effectively execute it, delivering sustained growth and shareholder value. With that, let me turn it back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Darren. We'll now begin our Q&A session. Please note that we continue to request that analysts ask a single question. As a courtesy to the other analysts. However, please remain on the line in case we need any clarifying questions. And with that, operator, please open a line for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone. We'll go first to Doug Leggett with Bank of America.\n\nDoug Leggett\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Darren, I wonder if I could pick up on the cost saving target. I guess my question is post Denbury. Given that we're already halfway through 2023, where does that $9 billion cost saving target go through the end of the plan period through 2027?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nIt goes up, Doug. In short, I think, as you know, and we've been talking about the reorganizations that we've been executing over the years, with some of them just recently executed, puts us in a position to really capture a lot of efficiencies across the whole of the enterprise this year as we develop our corporate plans.\nObviously, one of the objectives of these new organizations is to take stock of what they've got in their portfolio and identify the opportunities to further capture the benefits of scale and the synergies that exist between the integrated business and what, for the first time, represents an opportunity to actually manage processes across these integrated businesses. So I think we've got an opportunity set to drive that cost reduction even further as we head out further than the planned horizon.\nMy expectation is when we come back at the end of the year, after we've developed the plans, reviewed them with the board, and then share them with all y'all, we'll provide some perspective on what that opportunity looks like going forward.\n\nDoug Leggett\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nWould you care to offer an order of magnitude, Darren?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou know, Doug, I tell you to go back to the investor day materials from March of 2022. We had some bridges in it where we kind of laid out earnings and how much structural cost savings were driving earnings improvement relative to volume and mix. And I think if you just look at the size of those bars, you'll.\nGet a rough order of magnitude\n\nDoug Leggett\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nand then going forward. But I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, Darren. You've been clear that you think that there's value to be had potentially in M&A in both Low Carbon and the Permian, and Denbury really fits well into the former of those two. I'd be curious about your perspective on the M&A markets right now and how are you thinking about approaching opportunistic value creation with that?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, good morning, Neil. I would say that our perspective on that whole space, and I know it's one that's of great interest and we've talked about it seems like for a number of successive quarters, hasn't really changed, quite frankly. I think, you know, what we are holding ourselves to and evaluating opportunities in that space is the ability to create unique value, unique shareholder value.\nSo the opportunities have to be bigger than what ExxonMobil or any potential acquisition could do independent of one another. So I think you've heard us say that one plus one has to equal and that's what we are how we're thinking about that space. You know, obviously from the very beginning, back in 2018 when we started talking about better leveraging our key competitive advantages, one of the drives to do that is to open up value opportunities that basically others can't achieve.\nAnd as I've tried to make clear in this quarter's prepared remarks and in previous quarters, we're making great progress on better leveraging those competitive advantages, bringing them to bear on the business, delivering bottom line results. The more we do that, the more we advance our technology portfolio, the bigger the opportunity to identify unique.\nValue opportunities with other companies. And so we're continuing to look for that, but we're not going to compromise our expectation of generating returns and growing value for the shareholders. So I think Kathy's said many times in the past, we're pretty picky acquirers. I don't see us changing that position.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet, Neil.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next two is Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo I wanted to ask about the Permian. You've had strong results so far this year. In the slides you had some interesting charts and some of the advantages you see versus peers and how you develop the asset. I was wondering if we could dive into a little bit more detail on that. When you think about some of the specific drivers that allow you to get such better NPV versus other Cube development in the basin, what are those in your view? And as part of that, could you address the resource recovery trends you're seeing and the improvement there and any room for further upside on that?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. I guess maybe start by going back to the approach we outlined, 2018, 2019 timeframe, where we said, you know, ExxonMobil can bring a different game to the unconventional space and really bring to bear and leverage the capabilities that we have versus many others who are competing in that space. And key amongst those was taking advantage of our scale and balance sheet to develop this asset at scale. And so you may recall we talked about the Cube development which was really focusing on how you maximize overall recovery and not near term production.\nThat wasn't a particularly well received approach back in the 2018-2019 timeframe, but I think with time it's demonstrated its value and it's actually manifesting itself in the results that you see today, which is we're focused on making sure that as we develop the resources and all the benches in that resources, particularly the ones that are connected, that we do that in an optimum way that develops and maximizes the recovery versus initial production rates.\nThat's really important, that cube development we continue to evolve that. I think we've gotten to a stage now where we feel really good about how we're executing that development. We focused on capital efficiency, and I would tell you today we are setting records for the length of our lateral wells, which again lowers the cost associated with accessing the resource.\nImportantly, as you drill longer wells, it's critical that the productivity of each foot of that well remains constant. So we've done a lot of work to make sure that the productivity of each foot is consistent as we drill longer and longer. So that's driving capital costs down pretty significantly. And then I would say we've got a lot of technologies that we're trialing, ones that I won't go into specific detail on to try to maximize recovery. And we've got those technologies deployed in the field; we've got some early results that are quite encouraging, but they aren't at the scale to manifest themselves completely in our results.\nI think all those things together continue to give us a lot of confidence that not only have we moved to the front of the pack and demonstrated industry leadership with what we've got today. That we see a lot of upside to that as we move forward. I don't think we've reached the end of the optimization process yet.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Darren.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nMorning, Sam.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThis question is about EOR. Hopefully you don't find it too far afield, but because EOR par.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSam, you're kind of breaking up on us.\nSam, are you available?\nOperator. Let's try another question or come back to Sam.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm just looking at your bridge for energy products, and you have over $2 billion of negative margins. It's right in line with the number out of your 8-K. So no surprises there, but definitely a bigger decline on a relative basis than we're seeing from your couple of peers that have reported so far. So just looking for any additional color on the drivers of that margin decline, maybe there's something to call out around regional mix or crude slates that are a bit more unique to Exxon.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I wouldn't say there's anything unique. I mean, this is a straight flow through of just what the industry refining margin reduction is kind of flowing through. You know, we would see a much bigger reduction coming out of where we have a bigger footprint. So I would say even though the US tends to have better margins than the rest of the world, we obviously have a very big footprint in the US and so just that footprint drives a bigger absolute number and absolute decline, but it's just a straight flow through from the change in industry margins.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, our refining. The size of our refining business is much, much larger than our peers. So the impacts associated with the changes in those margins have a bigger impact on us than you'd see with our peers.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nSure. I was just looking at. It's kind of like a 50% cut to the Q1 number on the margin side, but. Yep. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Roger Reed with Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Reed\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hello. Good morning.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nMorning, Roger.\n\nRoger Reed\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI'd like to follow up on the chemicals margin. You know, you made the comment on the opening about, you know, margin or, excuse me, pricing, where it was in 2018, but margin's much better. That said, chemicals isn't quite back to the 2021 high point. So anything else you can offer on how the chemical outlook is getting any better.\nAnd one of the reasons I'll ask that question is when we look at the softness in NGL prices in the US and this expectation of much higher exports, we hear talk about, you know, increase in China chemical capacity. So how should we kind of juxtapose what looks like an improving market for you? Certainly better margins versus potentially a lot of new capacity into that area?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. I'll give you a couple perspectives on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add.\nI think first of all what I'd say is the work that we've done over the years to make sure that we've got a well diversified feed slate for our chemicals business continues to pay off, as particularly in these markets as things are shifting around and price spreads are moving. Our organization's pretty adept at responding to those price signals and change in feed. So that continues to.\nMake its way to the bottom line and position us better than many of our peers with that flexibility and the feed optionality that we have. I think as you look around the world, you know, early on there was, with China being in a COVID lockdown and recognizing the role that it has in chemicals demand, that was kind of the back half of last year, an impact.\nAs we've come into this year, I think a lot of expectations for chemicals for China to pick up, and with that growth in demand in chemicals, we are seeing that starting to happen. In fact, if you look at, you know, our sales in chemicals, the Q2 was stronger than the Q1. So we are seeing that the demand looks pretty reasonable, I would say.\nI mean the biggest challenge is, and you've referenced it, is the amount of supply that's come on. And that's where I think our feedstock advantages and our footprint in the integration that we have with a number of refineries around the world actually positions us better. But it'll take some time, is my expectation, for demand to kind of take us out of the supply, the excess supply that we've got on the marketplace.\nBut I would just add that we've made a lot of investment in chemicals over the last five years, fairly significant investments. And one of the things that frankly I'm quite pleased with is if you look at all those chemical investments that we bought online, even in the depths of what is a pretty low bottom of cycle condition for our chemical business, all of those brand new.\nProjects are earnings positive and cash positive, which I think really bodes well for when the market comes back up atop a cycle. So I feel good about how we position the business. And frankly, we're doing exactly what we had hoped for, which is when you get into tough conditions, that our business continues to outperform competition and so puts us in a good position, that as markets tighten back up again and margins improve, we'll be in an even better position.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nAnd I just want to add a couple quick stats to that. So relative to competition, again, our geographic footprint pretty advantaged. And so we're about 35% larger in North America than I'll call it rest of industry. And then the other thing I point out that gets to what Darren just said about some of the projects we've been implementing. Those projects help to support an improvement in our overall mix. And so this quarter we saw a 6% increase in performance chemical products, and those carry a higher margin. So those are some of the more systemic things that help to drive improvement relative to competitors.\n\nRoger Reed\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you. Follow-up question on the carbon capture side of the business. If we look, we've got global coal demand hitting a record in 2023, global oil demand is going to hit a record in 2023, if it hasn't already. Just curious, Darren, is there when you were, you've already laid out your strategy. All that makes sense. The Denbury acquisition certainly fits well in that.\nJust curious if you're getting any additional sort of outside pressure to maybe accelerate something on this, given that if you think about it from an energy transition standpoint, you know, two or three years ago everybody was saying we would have already had peak demand for this, peak demand for that. Clearly not happening if we're going to have a lot more carbon emissions. Are you getting any additional pressure to accelerate carbon capture?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I think what you're seeing today is a reflection of the challenge that the world faces, and frankly an incomplete solution set. I think, you know, unfortunately the focus, if you go back several years, and I would say the exclusive focus on wind, solar, and EVs, and the fact that other alternatives and other solutions that frankly at the time we were advocating for and in fact trying to develop internally weren't considered or actually weren't actually accepted, slowed society's progress and its emissions reductions and capturing.\nI think today there's this recognition that we need more solutions, and that frankly the industry can bring those solutions to bear. At this stage of what is going to be a very complicated and expensive transition, we need as many solutions on the table as possible. Not eliminating any of them and staying focused on emissions reductions.\nI think that's starting to resonate, and so I don't, you know, that the challenge here is this is a very nascent. The areas that we're focused on, which are the molecule-oriented parts of the business that, you know, are very consistent with our capabilities, expertise, and advantages. That's, we're in the very early stages, frankly, we're in the lead in that space. There aren't any other companies that have secured the kind of third-party emission reduction opportunities that we have.\nThere aren't any parties out there that have got the scale of the investments that we're progressing. And so I think generally people recognize that we're delivering on our ambition to lead the industry.\nMore than anything else are supportive. Obviously there's a desire to make things go faster, and frankly that's a function of the opportunity set. If you think about the IRA and the role that it plays, that legislation hasn't even been translated into regulations yet.\nThat's going to be a critical step. I think there are many governments around the world who are working on appropriate legislation to incentivize and create a carbon market for carbon that hasn't come to be yet. We're very early in this process, and there are a number of players in here who have a role to deliver. We feel like we're delivering on our part, but there are other elements that have to come together for this to be successful.\nUltimately, we're going to need advances in technology to keep driving that cost down so that we can get to more and more dilute streams of CO2. We're doing a lot of work in that space. Frankly, again, I think our pipeline of opportunities, our technology pipeline, I feel pretty good about, and I hope to, in the next several years, to hopefully commercialize some technologies that further reduce the cost of emissions reduction. So I think early, a lot of work going on. I think we're making a lot of good progress, and we feel good about the role that we're playing and the leadership position that we have.\n\nRoger Reed\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next is Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHello. Is that better, sound wise?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThat is better. That's better. Sam, welcome back.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. I'm okay. So this question is about EOR as it pertains to Denbury. I think, you know, there's some optimism that EOR barrels might be credited with carbon attributes because it buries more CO2 than the associated emissions of the oil. And so, you know, maybe that's option value. But I was just wondering where you stand on that topic and if it was at all a factor, you know, as you look at different asset classes and saw that EOR was available.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah. So I would say obviously that's the core business today of Denbury and had facilitated the infrastructure that they have in place that frankly for us was not a key driver, strategic driver of the opportunity. I think EOR certainly in the short term can play a role, but if you think about the broader opportunity, it's really around carbon capture, storage, sequestration, and keeping the carbon under the ground.\nSo that's the longer term play for us. As I just commented here about the challenges with the regulation and the translation of the IRA into regulation, we've got Class VI well permitting that's going to be required for sequestration. That's a fairly slow progress to date. So there's a lot of work that has to go into putting these pieces together so that we're successful.\nI see EOR as providing a lot of optionality in the short term that, as we're bringing on carbon capture facilities, working with third parties, and we start capturing the CO2, if we don't have everything lined up on the sequestration side, the EOR gives us an opportunity.\nTo progress these things and not lose schedule. So I think right now that's the way I would think about it. Certainly not a strategic thrust for us as a company.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Thank you so much.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome. Next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. I was wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the debottlenecking opportunity you talked about in Guyana. Clearly 20% above nameplate or above design is pretty significant. Darren, could you drill in a little bit on, you know, what you're seeing here? Is it, you know, changes to, you know, in the subsurface, is it changes in a kit, is it uptime, kind of scale that for us, and maybe just, I mean, is it really significant benefits if you roll it forward on a couple of the other projects that you have in the queue? So maybe just talk about how it's changing your view of the future opportunities. Thank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question. That's something that, frankly, the organization has spent decades and I'll start by just. I'd bucket it in three distinct buckets.\nFirst it starts with the design and.\nBuild out of the project itself. And so, having a projects organization with the capability that we built and strengthened here over the last several years, we end up with facilities that.\nHave the right design and are built the right way so that we've got a really good platform to optimize and a good opportunity to squeeze to find opportunities to maximize and optimize the production coming out of the facilities without compromising any of the design specifications, staying well within safe operating envelopes. We've done that over the years, a lot of our facilities. I think this project organization even extends that capability with the skills that they bring to the project development and the build out. Then I'd say the second bucket is our operations organization and the focus that they put on maximizing.\nUtilization and production. I think, you know, the mindset in the company is once you've got steel in the ground, you've got this capital. The operations job is to run it reliably, run it safely, run it in an environmentally responsible way, but at the same time maximize the value of that steel in the ground. And they've done a tremendous job of that. And it's, you know, it's not one big thing; it's a lot of little things that that organization stays focused on and pushes.\nAnd again, we've seen that not only in Guyana, but really all the capital projects that we've been bringing on. The organization has done a great job of making sure that we're maximizing the value of the capital that we've invested. And then the third bucket, I would say, is our technology organization.\nAnd again, we've taken the step to consolidate all of our technology organizations and move from what was a business oriented construct to a capabilities construct. And so we've got our best people brought together, working on our biggest opportunities. It's, it's really driving innovation and creativity. And this close partnership that technology now has with the business and the shared commitment to drive value leads to more technology getting out in the field and assisting the operations group in squeezing.\nSo I'd say all those are coming together. My expectation is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we're going to see the first two FPSOs get above 400,000 barrels a day as we continue to optimize, and we'll do that in a very safe and environmentally responsible way. My expectation is when the third boat comes on with Payara, we'll see similar levels of improvement there.\nAnd frankly, the expectation that we have for ourselves is that as we build, go forward and continue to build these projects, we'll continue to find the same kind of benefits and optimization opportunities, opportunities with the projects. And it comes back to this inherent capability that we've built into our businesses.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks so much.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nNext to you, Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nMorning, Ryan.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat morning.\nA question may be back on the upstream. Even given the pricing environment.\nUpstream performance that we've seen for the quarter, not just for you, but for other peers that reported this week have been a little weaker than expected, with much of that seemingly driven by the global gas environment. Can you talk about drivers or headwinds that you maybe saw during the quarter on pricing relative to headline markers, maybe headwinds in trading or any other potential drivers there, and how those might evolve over the remainder of this year?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nI'll let Kathy maybe dive into a little more detail. I would just say with respect to pricing and the impact on the business, actually.\nOur quarter came in pretty much in line with what we had expected. If you looked at the 8-K that we put out and our best attempt to model the impact just from the market environment, we are pretty rigorous in making sure that when we put an 8-K out that it's really focused on discrete planned events, but much more importantly on what the market impact has been to the business quarter-on-quarter. And so I think that kind of laid out pretty consistently with what we expected. Obviously, gas prices were down.\nBut I think refining margins down a bit, but still in very healthy territory. And if you look at the fundamentals, quite frankly, as we head into the back half of the year, I think, you know, as demand picks up, we're going to see.\nThe limits that we have on additional supply, I think, come back into the mix and see supply-demand tighten up a bit. So my expectation is the back half of the year we'll see some upward pressure just given demand changes and the limited options we have to significantly increase supply. Kathy, anything to add to that?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I'll mention a couple of other things to you. As a result of some of the divestments we've done over the past year, if you look at our gas portfolio, we're now about 45% LNG. So a little bit more tip to LNG if you just look at kind of impact of pricing across our gas portfolio and results, I mean, Henry Hub was down about 40%, TTF was down, you know, almost 50%. And the last thing I'd say is we always talk about the fact that on LNG a lot of our contracts are tied to lagged oil prices. And so if you just look at where oil prices were in the Q4 kind of relative to where they are more currently, you know, I'm going to call them down roughly $10 a barrel.\nAnd so, you know, that pricing impact would have flowed through as well. And then the last thing that I will mention associated with our trading results is if you exclude mark-to-market. So if you look in upstream, mark-to-market was a positive for us in the quarter, but if you exclude it mark-to-market, I would have then said our gas trading results were a little bit lighter this quarter. So kind of all of that packaged together, I think gives you a pretty good understanding of our gas results.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHey. Morning.\nI want to ask about another energy transition area that's been receiving some attention in the media in terms of ExxonMobil's activity, which is lithium drilling and then refining. It seems like you're wading a bit more into this space. I'm wondering how you view that opportunity, given your expertise in drilling and refining of materials in the ground, and if that development in that space was contemplated at all in that $17 billion energy transition budget that you previously laid out. Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. Yeah, maybe I'll just come back to kind of the fundamentals of how we think about.\nExxonMobil's participation in the transition space. It comes back to the.\nFocus on leveraging the advantages that we have as a corporation where we believe we can add unique value. That's why we have, since the very beginning, stayed focused on what I'd say is the molecule side of the equation and carbon capture and hydrogen and biofuels. But we're looking at.\nFrankly, all the areas that we believe we have an expertise and a unique capability and seeing if there's a fit for products or solutions that can help society decarbonize lithium. And production of lithium from brine water is, if you think about what's required to do that is really an extension of a lot of the current capabilities that we have in our upstream. It requires a good understanding of the subsurface, requires a good understanding of reservoir management.\nRequires drilling and injections. So I think the below surface things are very much in line with the skills and capabilities that we've built out over the decades in our upstream business. The processing of the brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries, chemical plants, and, in fact, in some of our upstream operations. So that piece of the equation is, again, not new to the company.\nSo as you look at all that, I think the capability, the skill set that we have, the operating experience that we have, all lend themselves to that. And then, of course, there's the question of how does the market fundamentals look and supply and demand, and do we see a role for what we're doing there? And frankly we've been looking at that for quite some time.\nI'd say we're still early in evaluating the opportunity, but we believe that by again applying our advantages in this space that we can bring on a much needed resource, lithium, one that's predicted to go short. We can bring it on at a much lower cost, and I think importantly with much less environmental impact versus say the open mining that they're doing in other parts of the world. So this to us feels like a potential win, win, win opportunity.\nA win using our capabilities and win from an environmental impact standpoint and a win in terms of supplying markets with a crucial component to electrification and EV. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it and we're, I'd say, actively exploring that opportunity set and like what we're seeing so far.\n\nJason Gabelman\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. That's really helpful. Color? Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next to Josh Silverstein with UBS.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning guys. So the cash balance is still around $30 billion for about four quarters now. And Kathy, last quarter you mentioned that you were comfortable holding the larger balance because of the net positive spread in interest rates versus your debt cost. That spread is still there. So you're probably not in a rush to do anything, but just wondering if this is still the best use of cash versus deploying it into higher rate of return projects or buybacks. And if the forward curve holds the current kind of strip right now, could you foresee Exxon going into a net cash position next year? Thanks.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nSure. And so we're pretty happy with our overall balance sheet position right now. And I've stated for a couple quarters now that we expect our cash balance is going to ebb and flow a little bit just based on how the commodity price environment and margin environment ebbs and flows. But we think it's pretty critical to hang onto a really strong balance sheet because it gives us the flexibility that we need through the cycles.\nIf you look overall at what we're doing from an investment perspective, I would say we're never trying to constrain the organization in terms of deploying good capital investments. And that's across our entire business. It includes our LCS business. Obviously the acquisition of Denbury will enable us to accelerate the growth of our carbon capture and sequestration business within LCS.\nWe're excited about that opportunity and profitably growing that part of our business. So I think it's really important when we talk about capital deployment that we are not trying to constrain the company from new capital projects that can drive good returns for our shareholders. That's how we create, I'd say, the virtuous cycle of how we can then support competitive growing dividends that are sustainable over the long term, and a more consistent share repurchase program.\nI'd say we're really happy with our balance sheet. We intend to hang on to a higher cash balance than the company has done historically, just to give us more flexibility as we think about how we manage the company over the long term and through the cycle.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nJust maybe to emphasize the point a third time that Kathy made, the mandate to the businesses is find advantage projects that position us ahead of competition and deliver high returns, high value. And.\nThat's the mandate they've been given. We will fund those opportunities as they come forward. I think what you see in terms of what limits the investment is the ability to manifest those opportunities. I think it's the challenge that we give our organization to only fund the things that we feel confident are robust to very low price environment, are well ahead of other companies, and tap into what I would say are the long-term fundamentals of the market. I think as we find those things and the organization is very focused on developing those opportunities, we, we'll fund them because that's how you generate long-term value for the corporation and our shareholders.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nMorning. Thanks for the time. My question is on OFS costs. Just your thoughts both domestically and internationally for the remainder of the year and into 2024. How you're thinking about either inflation or deflation?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYes, I mean the way that we're thinking about inflation and whether it's oilfield services costs or other costs across the business, I'd say we've gotten to a point where we're actually starting to see inflation come off in certain cost categories. You know, if you think about some of the chemicals that we would use and unconventional things like sand, what we would call tubular goods, which would include piping, valves, and those types of things.\nWe're starting to see some deflationary pressure now as it relates to things where labor is a high component of the cost. I would say we're not yet necessarily seeing that deflationary pressure coming through yet. But overall, I'd say it's probably too early to see much of that come through. The second half of the year.\nAs we're looking forward into 2024, I'd say we fundamentally feel like inflation is going to come off as we're looking forward because we're starting to see those signs across multiple categories now throughout the business.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nNext to Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nGood morning.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. You've previously set a sort of target to spend $17 billion in the low carbon business through 2027. Denbury acquisition is about 30%. And you're also saying that you're seeing a lot more opportunities. Should we interpret that your $17 billion, that number, will need to increase perhaps quite substantially?\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Paul. I think as you rightly point out, the Denbury acquisition was not part of the $17 billion. Maybe just a little bit of perspective on that. We've, given that we're just starting that business up, as you can imagine, very early in the opportunity set and progressing the opportunity set.\nI think Dan and his team in the low carbon solutions business have made tremendous progress in bringing those opportunities to bear and manifest in contracts with customers, as we've talked about with the three big customers that we now have, and demonstrating that we can decarbonize some of these harder to decarbonize industries that don't have a lot of good alternatives. We've also got a very significant investment opportunity in Baytown to bring on the world's largest hydrogen plant. And then we've got opportunities for low carbon ammonia associated with that.\nSo I think a pretty robust portfolio. With the announcements of the deals that we've got to date, the commercial deals that we struck with the announcement of Denbury, I think a lot of recognition and interest by outside potential customers that there's a real opportunity here and that ExxonMobil provides a real solution. So that's the context. I would say the $17 billion.\nAs we that was a looking at a portfolio of opportunities and then trying to assess how those, how quickly those opportunities would manifest themselves and the capital that would be required to do that. We're continuing that work. There's a lot. So as we continue to develop and make progress on these projects, some of the capital becomes more discrete, and we can see it a lot clearer. Other deals move out. So I'd say right now it's a portfolio approach.\nWe're not changing the $17 billion to date. Frankly, the Denbury acquisition, if that goes through, will allow us to pull back on some of the grassroots investments that we were making in logistics and substitute that with the assets that we brought in from Denbury. So it's, I'd say, kind of an evolving space.\nI think the thing to stay focused on, we're not going to compromise on our return criteria or the advantaged criteria that we're insisting on for the projects that we bring to bear. We have to be low cost suppliers in this space. We have to be leveraging the advantages the corporation has and we have to be generating good competitive returns. That's going to dictate the pace of.\nHow quickly that CapEx manifests itself and frankly the size of it. As we go through this year's plan, I know Dan and his team's very focused on, based on, you know, a year having gone, you know, they'll have a year under their belt of continuing to execute and drive this business. We'll develop more detailed plans and update that number. I don't know if Kathy, you have anything you want to add for Paul?\nYeah, just other thing I'd want to mention is, especially as it relates to the CCS business, what you're going to see over time is that we're building a backlog. And that backlog is what's going to support the future growing CapEx kind of over the longer term and the profitable growth of that business. So today I would describe ExxonMobil's backlog is 5 million tons annually supported by three very large industrial customers. One in the industrial gas sector, one in the steel sector, and one that makes ammonia that's used for fertilizer.\nIf you just think about what that does for society, those 5 million tons annually, that translates into the conversion of about 2 million cars from gas-powered vehicles to, to electric vehicles. That's about all the cars that are on the road in the US today.\nAnd when we talk about the overall CCS opportunity across the Gulf Coast, we talk about 100 million tons annually. You know that's 20 times that number. But I'm going to go back to the fact that it will be supported by customer backlog that supports a growing profitable business. So that's how you should think about it.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGreat, thank you. Can I sneak in a real quick question?\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nOf course,\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nyeah.\nThank you. Real quick, Darren, do you have a number you can share? What is the production for Permian in this quarter? In the Q2.\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\n620,000 boe/d.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYou bet. Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nLooks like we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.\n\nPaul Sankey\n\nIndependent Analyst, Sankey Research\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. Just almost a follow up, just to follow up actually. Just looking at your volumes upstream. First of all, you mentioned that there was turnarounds and stuff, but I wondered if you could talk about.\nThe recovery, especially in the light of the stronger Guyana volumes. You know, the fact that your upstream volumes are down quite hard here is that going to be a rapid recovery in Q3 and back towards what kind of levels would we expect for the rest of the year? Thanks.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, sure Paul. I'll take that. If you think about Q1, we were up pretty significantly Q2 or down from that Q1, but essentially on plan with respect to the full year production levels that we talked about at the back end of last year when we put our plan forward. I would tell you that there's nothing that we're seeing today that changes that guidance that we gave last year of 3.7 million barrels a day of production.\nSo I'd say we're on track with that. We're not seeing anything that makes us change our mind and obviously we're working real hard to do better than that. But I would say right now we feel like we're on track to, to meet the plan and meet the numbers that we shared earlier last year.\n\nPaul Sankey\n\nIndependent Analyst, Sankey Research\n\nCan you say more about the down times that you had in Q2?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, I'll just mention we had given a bit of guidance to divestment and schedule downtime, and that guidance was that we thought we'd see a reduction about 110,000 boe/d. If I said what the actuals were across both of those items, it was actually 120, and that's a sequential number. So we were down sequence sequentially 120,000 boe/d as a result of divestments and the scheduled downtime. If you then just look at why was our overall production down a little bit more than that? It was really driven by two things.\nSo we've seen curtailments, and obviously OPEC is cutting production, and so we have an impact coming from that. And then in terms of unscheduled downtime, we had a short strike in Nigeria that tipped up our unscheduled downtime. But again I would go back to what Darren said.\nWe had guided for the full year at about 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels a day. If you looked at our year-to-date numbers, we're up about 15,000 on a year-to-date basis, year-over-year.\n\nPaul Sankey\n\nIndependent Analyst, Sankey Research\n\nThat's super helpful. And then if I just follow up, if I look at your energy product sales, those are up just about as much if not more positively.\nObviously that's mostly Beaumont, I guess. But is there anything else to add there to the strength?\n\nKathy Mikells\n\nSVP and CFO, ExxonMobil\n\nYeah, no, Beaumont is the main thing. Then we obviously had a bit less maintenance kind of going on, which helped our volumes as well. I'd mentioned that Beaumont was running at 90% utilization, so again, a really nice, I think, proof point and just the operational excellence across the company.\n\nPaul Sankey\n\nIndependent Analyst, Sankey Research\n\nGreat. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\n\nDarren Woods\n\nChairman and CEO, ExxonMobil\n\nThank you, Paul.\n\nJennifer Driscoll\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ExxonMobil\n\nThanks, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q and A session on our Investors section of our website as soon as it's available early next week. Before we conclude, I have one important announcement to share with you. Please mark your calendars for the ExxonMobil product solutions spotlight. It's going to be on Wednesday, 20 September, at 1:00 Central Time.\nJack Williams, Senior Vice President who oversees Product Solutions, will be joined by Karen McKee, President of Product Solutions, and several other leaders from ExxonMobil, to talk about this new group formed in April 2022. For additional information about this upcoming event, watch the Investor section of our website. With that, have a nice weekend, everyone, and I'll turn it back to the operator to close it off.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. .\nOur presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the new Investor Relations section of our website. They're meant to accompany the first quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will provide opening comments and reference a few slides from this presentation. That will give analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at 8:30 a.m. Central Time.\nDuring the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We describe some of them in our cautionary statement here on Slide 2. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs available on our website for investors. Also, please note that we provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website.\nAnd now please turn to Slide 3 for Darren's remarks.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us today. Following a record year, ExxonMobil delivered the highest first quarter earnings in our history even as energy prices and refining margins moderated from the fourth quarter. This ongoing success reflects the hard work of our people, executing our strategic priorities and fully leveraging our competitive advantages.\nThrough investments in advantaged assets, mix improvements and cost and operating discipline. We are delivering the structural earnings improvements outlined in our corporate plan update last December and expanding the energy supplies needed to meet growing global demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we added about 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to global supply, primarily from a 40% increase in production from Guyana in the Permian Basin, increase more than offset our divestments in the expropriation of Sakhalin-1, which we no longer account for but which importantly remains part of global supply.\nIn addition, our Beaumont Refinery expansion reached nameplate capacity in the quarter. This 250,000 barrel a day expansion is the largest U.S. refinery addition in a decade, helping meet society's ongoing need for transportation fuels. Guyana, we're pleased to announce that we reached final investment decisions for Uaru, fifth offshore project, which will bring on even more production from this low-cost, low-carbon intensity resource. Uaru will provide an additional 250,000 barrels a day of gross capacity with start-up targeted for 2026.\nEarnings in our Product Solutions business benefited from the team's solid operational execution with top quartile turnaround cost and schedule performance during a particularly heavy planned maintenance period. Low Carbon Solutions, we're building momentum across several fronts. In early April, we announced a long-term agreement with Linde to capture, transport and permanently store up to 2.2 million metric tons CO2 annually. Hydrogen, we announced front-end engineering and design contract for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen facility in Baytown, ahead of agreement with SK Group of Korea for offtake of blue ammonia from that facility.\nAs we said during our Low Carbon Solutions spotlight earlier this month, our low carbon projects must be advantaged and deliver competitive returns. The ability of our low-carbon projects to compete successfully for capital is important if the world is going to meet its emissions aspirations. Incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act are a positive step forward, although permitting and other regulatory improvements are still needed. Europe, by contrast, policy approach remains far more prescriptive and punitive. This is true whether we're talking about the emissions reductions needed to put the world on a path to net zero or the production needed to provide Europe with affordable and reliable energy.\nThe progress we're making across the company is underpinned by the continuing evolution of our business model. Effective on May 1, 2 new enterprise-wide organizations will be up and running. Global Business Solutions will centralize the majority of our finance procurement operations, enabling us to deliver simplified corporate-wide processes. ExxonMobil Supply Chain will consolidate supply chain activities globally organizations will focus on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies, improve operating and financial results and, importantly, deliver an improved experience for customers, vendors and our people --\nOn June 1, we plan to launch our new enterprise-wide trading organization. [ Mobil Trading ] will bring together expertise from across the company in crude, products, natural gas, power and marine freight trading, planning to build on our record 2022 results, leveraging the unique insights we gain from participating across each of our value chains and all along their entire length with a global operating footprint larger than any of our competitors.\nNow let me cover the quarter's headlines. We're pleased to have delivered $11.4 billion of earnings, a record first quarter following a record year. A significant contributing factor was structural cost savings that now total approximately $7.2 billion, keeps us on track to meet our target of $9 billion by the end of this year. Cash flow from operations totaled $16.3 billion and our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to 4%, further increasing the strength of our balance sheet while supporting shareholder distributions of $8.1 billion in the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends.\nBiodynamic market, our underlying performance remains rock solid and well ahead of our competition, reflecting the many improvements we've made over the last 6 years and, of course, the hard work of our people. Our diverse portfolio of advantaged businesses, improvements in mix, structural cost savings, excellence in execution are driving industry-leading earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we have the capability to win across a wide variety of market conditions to deliver strong returns while meeting the evolving needs of society, including the need to reduce emissions.\nLeveraging the capabilities and advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we're building an advantaged new business, [ Full Carbon Solutions, ] which is positioning us as a leader in the energy transition in our own and other's emissions and establishing long-term value-accretive growth opportunities that will underpin continued growth in shareholder returns.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren. Now let's move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. With that, operator, please open up the line for our first question.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us today. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our fourth quarter earnings news release is posted in the same location and will be joined by the transcript once it's available.\nShortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from this presentation. That will give analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at about 8:30 a.m. Central Time.\nDuring the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, so we encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments is listed in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website.\nAlso, as a reminder, we posted our Advancing Climate Solutions Report, Sustainability Report and Energy Outlook online in mid-December. We reference them in today's presentation, and you can find them on our website under the Sustainability tab.\nLastly, in the past, we've held an annual Investor Day in March. We won't be hosting an Investor Day in 2023. Last December, we laid out comprehensive plans for 2023 through 2027 as part of our Corporate Plan Update, and the company is already executing on these plans. We've been enjoying the higher level of investor engagement that we've been having. We'll continue to seek your feedback, to host events that give you access to our leaders and insights on parts of the business that interest you and to share with you information about the company and our plans on more of a real-time basis.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Darren.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThanks, Jennifer. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today.\nBefore covering our 2022 results, I want to start by recognizing our people. Their hard work and commitment, not only to the company, but to meeting the critical needs of society, are what drove the strong results we reported this morning.\nTheir work is not easy. Whether it's achieving industry-leading safety, driving record levels of environmental performance, increasing production, offsetting runaway inflation, effectively responding to expropriations or quickly recovering for winter storms, to name just a few of the challenges, our people delivered while, I'll add, continuing to manage significant ongoing organizational changes. As I cover our results, I think you'll see why we and the entire management team are so proud of their efforts.\nOf course, our results clearly benefited from a favorable market. To take full advantage of the undersupplied market, our work began years ago, well before the pandemic, and we chose to invest counter-cyclically. We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom. We continue with these investments through the pandemic and into today.\nThis year, our improved asset portfolio, organization changes and strong operating performance came together to deliver industry-leading results, industry-leading earnings, cash flows, return on capital employed and total shareholder returns. Excluding asset sales, we had our best cash flow performance since the merger.\nAnd despite lower revenues, we delivered higher profits than 2012, our previous record year, with a 400 basis point improvement in profit margin, reflecting upgrades to our product mix, structural cost reductions, disciplined expense management.\n2022 was also a year of strong progress across our 5 strategic priorities. Importantly, we've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian at a time when the world needed it most.\nWe implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage our scale and integration, improve effectiveness and better serve our customers. We combined our downstream and chemical companies to form Product Solutions, the world's largest fuels, chemicals and lubricants business. This new integrated business is focused on developing high-value products, improving portfolio value and leading in sustainability.\nWe're also now supporting our businesses with corporate-wide organizations, including projects, technology, engineering, operations, safety and sustainability. We see further opportunities in supply chain, procurement and finance.\nWe continued to expand our Low Carbon Solutions business, recently signed the first-of-its-kind customer contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This agreement, in a hard-to-decarbonize sector, highlights how ExxonMobil can leverage our advantages to help others reduce their emissions and build an attractive business with strong returns and significant opportunities for growth.\nThe recent passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes both hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, further reinforces this. To that end, in December, we shared our plans to invest approximately $17 billion in lower-emissions opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in our prior plan.\nWe also made significant progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our existing operations and remain on track with our 2030 emissions-reduction plans, including net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin by 2030.\nIn addition to investing in industry-advantaged projects, we took advantage of the strong markets to further high-grade our asset portfolio with approximately $5 billion in divestments of non-core assets. CapEx was in line with our guidance.\nTo further increase transparency, in 2022, we introduced 3 new reports: the Lobbying Report, which provides additional disclosure of our lobbying activities and expenditures; Climate Lobbying Report, which provides details on our U.S. activities at the federal and state level; and our Investing in People supplement, an addition to our updated Sustainability Report.\nLastly, as I mentioned, the hard work of our people underpinned our success this past year, as it has done for decades. We build on this advantage every year by attracting and developing the best talent. This past year, we were once again recognized as top in industry for most attractive employer among U.S. engineering students, an honor we've received 10 years in a row.\nOur 2022 financial results, which led the industry, further confirmed the strength of the strategy we developed 5 years ago. We grew earnings to nearly $56 billion, $59 billion excluding identified items, significantly outpacing peers. We delivered an industry-leading total shareholder return of 87% and a return on capital employed of 25%, our highest 1-year ROCE since 2012.\nCash flow from operating activities was nearly $77 billion, also leading the industry. This enabled us to reduce net debt to 5%, fortifying the balance sheet and positioning us to continue our strategy of countercyclically investing.\nOur continued focus on leveraging scale and integration drove further efficiencies with nearly $6.9 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019, up from $5.3 billion at the end of 2021. We remain on plan to meet our target of $9 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2023.\nConsistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share our success with shareholders through a reliable and growing dividend. In 2022, we boosted the quarterly dividend by more than 3% and marked the 40th consecutive annual increase. Additionally, we increased our share repurchase program twice during the year. In total, we returned $30 billion to shareholders in 2022, including about $15 billion in dividends, which also led peers.\nThese actions reflect the confidence we have in our strategy, the performance we've seen across our businesses and the strength of our company's future. We're proud of our people and their work to meet the evolving needs of society. As we advance our strategy and the \"and\" equation, we're committed to sharing their progress.\nConsistent with this, we continue to enhance our disclosures and increase transparency. In December, we updated several important online publications. Our latest Sustainability Report describes the 14 focus areas where we believe our company can have the most impact.\nThe Advancing Climate Solutions 2023 Progress Report outlines our approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net-zero future. It includes updated resiliency modeling under the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, including the addition of carbon and pricing assumptions, and an audit statement from Wood Mackenzie.\nIn addition, it includes a discussion on the value of a life-cycle approach to measuring company-specific emissions versus Scope 3 targets. We believe a life-cycle approach for companies is more aligned with the principles of ESG, better reflects a company's efforts to reduce society's emissions and avoids the negative consequences of a company-specific Scope 3 target.\nThe update also contains more information on how we're driving reductions in methane emissions. And finally, it includes a look at the role of plastics in the energy transition and how we're expanding our capacity for advanced recycling to help address the issue of plastic waste.\nSeparately, we've updated our Outlook for Energy, which is our latest view of energy supply and demand through 2050. It forms the basis for our business planning. In addition to assessing trends in economic development, technology advances and consumer behavior, our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often targets specific sectors.\nWe encourage you to read these publications to gain a better understanding of how we're working to be a leader in the energy transition. They are available on our website under the Sustainability tab.\nOur plan for 2023 remains anchored in our existing strategy and builds on our continuing success. I'll wrap up by highlighting a few key areas. Critically, we'll continue our efforts to lead the industry in safety, operating and financial performance. We'll continue to profitably grow the business through advantaged investments to meet the world's evolving needs and reduce emissions.\nWe'll further leverage our new organization to fully realize our advantages in scale and integration and improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver another $2 billion in structural cost reductions, meeting our target of $9 billion in savings versus 2019.\nWe'll look to capture additional organizational synergies by consolidating our supply chain activities and centralizing a majority of our finance and procurement operations. It will help us take better advantage of our scale and greatly improve our customer, vendor and employee experience.\nWe anticipate 2023 capital and exploration expenses of $23 billion to $25 billion. This includes investments in the next development in Guyana and increased spending in U.S. unconventional assets. It also includes advancing our China chemical complex and numerous emission-reduction opportunities.\nWe'll advance our work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity in our operated assets and help customers reduce theirs, focusing on hard-to-decarbonize sectors. We'll continue to progress our blue hydrogen project in Baytown that consists of 1 billion cubic feet per day blue hydrogen plant, the world's largest, and a CCS project with potential to store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year. We'll also leverage our recent success in Louisiana to grow the customer base for our Low Carbon Solutions business.\nAs energy system evolves, our focus on the fundamentals and investments in the integrated but diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses will play a crucial role in capturing value and outperforming competition, irrespective of the pace or path of the transition.\nAs you've seen, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities: investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage across the commodity cycles and sharing our success through shareholder distributions.\nWe've demonstrated our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and further sharing our success through the share repurchase program with up to $35 billion in cumulative repurchases in 2023 and 2024.\n2022 demonstrated the importance of the \"and\" equation and the strength of our strategy. We feel good about the progress we've made and even better about the opportunities ahead.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, Darren. Now let's move to Q&A. As a courtesy to other analysts, please ask a single question. That way we can accommodate questions from more people. However, we ask that you remain on the line in case we need to ask any clarifying questions. With that, Jennifer, please open up the line for our first question.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call today at our new time of 7:30 a.m. Central. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis live presentation, our prerecorded remarks and the news release are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from the prerecorded presentation. This allows us more time for questions before we conclude at 8:30 a.m. Central Time.\nDuring the presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. For additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments, please refer to our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. Please note, we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides.\nNow please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Before covering our earnings highlights, I want to begin by recognizing the men and women of ExxonMobil. While this quarter's results were clearly helped by a favorable market, fact is we're in this position because of the hard work and commitment of our people over the past few years. Where others pulled back in the face of uncertainty and a historic slowdown, retreating and retrenching, this company moved forward, continuing to invest and build to help meet the demands we see today and position the company for long-term success in each of our businesses.\nWe understand how important our role is in providing the energy and products the world needs. And while the market has clearly been a factor, results we report today reflect that deep commitment. I mentioned this because it is at the heart of our company and its culture. We know the role we play and are incredibly proud of it. We work together as a team, confident in our mission and determined to do our part in meeting the world's energy needs and leading the way in a thoughtful energy transition.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our third quarter operational and financial results. Higher natural gas realizations, strong refinery throughput, robust refining margins and rigorous cost control drove our earnings improvement. We continue to increase production to address the needs of consumers, which contributed to earnings and cash flow growth, a stronger balance sheet and significant value creation. Our results also reflected the outstanding work of our teams across the world who operate our facilities reliably at high utilization rates.\nLet me highlight a few examples of our progress. First, Energy Products. We boosted overall refinery throughput to its highest quarterly level since 2008, responding to tight market conditions. And we continue to make progress on the Beaumont refinery expansion, which will increase capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe also increased production from our high-return assets in the Permian and Guyana. Our production in the Permian Basin reached nearly 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, building on our strong growth from last year. We grew our production in Guyana to 360,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, with Liza Phase 1 and 2, both exceeding design capacity. We also had continued exploration success with 2 additional discoveries in the quarter. Earlier this month, first LNG production was achieved from Mozambique's Coral South floating LNG development, contributing new supply amid growing demand for LNG globally.\nWe continue to expect total upstream production of 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels per day for the year. Looking longer term, we remain on track to grow low-cost production and meet our 2027 plan, with more than 90% of our Upstream investments, generating over 10% returns at $35 per barrel.\nOur ability to increase production while reducing cost, improves our competitive position, benefits consumers and generates capital to fund meaningful investments, demonstrated by one of our recent press releases, announcing that our low carbon solutions business signed its first and the largest of its kind, customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2.\nThis marks an important milestone in developing our newest business. It's also a good example of how we're supporting other companies in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. We look forward to sharing more about our progress in developing attractive low-carbon solutions business in December as part of our corporate plan discussions.\nWe continue to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the sale of our interest in the Aera oil production operations in California and our refinery in Billings, Montana. Proceeds from divestments completed year-to-date totaled $4 billion as we captured incremental value for these noncore assets in today's higher price environment. These sales enable us to concentrate on our higher-value advantaged assets.\nFinally, you may have heard earlier this month that with 2 decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated ExxonMobil's interest in Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project to a Russian operator. In March, we stated our intention to exit the Sakhalin-1 project and discontinue our role as operator and took an impairment of approximately $3.4 billion at the time.\nWhile our affiliate was in force majeure due to the unprecedented impact of global sanctions, we continue to make every attempt to engage in good faith discussions with the Russian government and all Sakhalin-1 partners to effect a smooth exit to the benefit of all parties. Our priority all along has been to protect employees, the environment and the integrity of operations at the facility.\nWhile the recent decrees violate our rights in Russia established by our production sharing agreement and interrupted the exit process we were working, it did not prevent us from safely winding down our operations. We're proud of our employees and the many significant achievements they led since 1996, including the most recent challenge of the government takeover. We do not anticipate any new material costs associated with the exit.\nThis next slide illustrates the variability the industry is experiencing across the markets most relevant to our business. In the third quarter, crude prices moved back within the upper end of the 10-year range as higher supply slightly exceeded demand. Natural gas prices rose to record levels in the third quarter, reflecting concerns in Europe about the withdrawal of Russian supply as well as efforts to build inventory ahead of winter. While natural gas prices recently moderated, they remain well above the 10-year historical range.\nIn the U.S., prices increased by about 15%, driven by higher summer cooling demand and inventory concerns. Refining margins remained well above the 10-year range due to inflated diesel crack spreads, resulting from expensive natural gas and high demand for diesel. Higher refinery runs and flat demand for gasoline in the U.S. resulted in refining margins declining from the second quarter. In contrast, global chemical margins fell below the bottom of the 10-year range, reflecting weakening global demand. Margins in North America and Europe have softened, with regional pricing moving closer to global parity as demand and logistics constraints relaxed.\nAsia Pacific remained in bottom-of-cycle conditions as COVID restrictions continue to suppress demand in China. Despite these challenges, our chemical products business delivered another solid quarter on improved product mix, strong reliability and good cost control.\nBefore leaving this chart, I want to make one other very important point, the value of a diversified portfolio. With just the 3 quarters shown, you can see how the value has shifted across our different businesses. Our diversified portfolio has served us well during the volatile swings in prices and margins across the various businesses. As the energy system evolves along an uncertain path, the investments in our broad portfolio of advantaged businesses, including our Low Carbon Solutions business will play an even more important role in capturing value in outperforming competition in the very near term, and across a much longer time horizon.\nBefore I turn it over to Jennifer, let me recap our key takeaways on the quarter. We continue to progress our advantaged investments, drove additional structural efficiencies and created sustainable solutions that deliver the energy and products everyone needs. This has resulted in strong earnings growth, bolstered by higher refining throughput and cost control which more than offset margin declines.\nWe've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from our high-return assets in Guyana and the Permian. In addition, earlier this month, our low carbon solutions business signed a largest-of-its-kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This is a strong indication of the growth opportunity we have in this new business.\nWe've also continued to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the Aera Upstream and Billings refinery divestments and closing the sales of our Romanian Upstream affiliate and XTO Energy Canada. Our diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses and robust balance sheet provide a strong foundation to invest in value-accretive projects and drive attractive shareholder returns through the cycle.\nIn aggregate, the work we are doing today is delivering critical products in a very short market. Longer term, we're delivering improvements that strengthen our structural advantages, meet society's growing needs for energy and modern products, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and double earnings and cash flow by 2027 versus 2019. In short, profitably leading our industry toward a net zero future. Thank you.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, Darren. Before we start our Q&A session, I have 2 important announcements to share with you all. Please mark your calendar for our annual Corporate Plan Update scheduled for Thursday, December 8 at 8:30 a.m. Central Standard Time, where I'll be joined by Kathy Mikells to share the details of our corporate plan. Additionally, please keep an eye out for our 2022 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in mid-December.\nNow with that, we'll begin our Q&A session.

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nGood morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining Exxon Mobil's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me today are: Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur quarterly presentation with prerecorded remarks was posted earlier today on the Investors section of our website, along with the second quarter earnings news release. During our live 1-hour conference call, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from the earlier presentation before we move to the question-and-answer period.\nMay I remind you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. We also have provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, including reconciliation.\nNow please turn to Slide 3, and we'll turn the call over to Darren.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter operational and financial results were very strong. While the market has clearly been a factor, our results reflect our focus on the fundamentals as well as plans and investments we put in motion several years ago and stuck with through the depths of the pandemic.\nThey also reflect the outstanding work of our teams across the world to operate our facility safely at high utilization levels, which drove needed production and throughput. We are proud of their commitment to supplying the energy and products the world needs and delivering on our strategic priorities.\nIncreased production, higher realizations and aggressive cost control generated strong earnings and cash flow. We also delivered excellent safety and operating performance. As global demand recovers, we continued to invest in our portfolio and grew our year-to-date production in the Permian by about 130,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day versus the first half of 2021.\nFor the full year, in the Permian, we expect to achieve 25% production growth for the second consecutive year. In Guyana, our total capacity is now more than 340,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.\nOur Liza Phase 1 development is producing above design capacity with excellent performance. Liza Phase 2 started production earlier this year and has recently reached the design capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. As demand has continued to recover, so as production from our industry-leading refining circuit. We increased throughput by 180,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2021.\nWe continue to demonstrate our value as an essential partner during the quarter. For example, Exxon Mobil has recently been awarded an interest in Qatar's North Field East expansion. We have worked closely with the Qataris for decades. This attractive agreement further leverages our experience as a global leader in LNG, giving us the opportunity to help grow Qatar's LNG capacity by 30 million tons per annum by 2026.\nPartnerships such as these are also an important part of unlocking future opportunities in our new businesses like carbon capture and storage. We recently signed multiple MOUs to explore the development of large-scale CCS projects in China, Australia, the Netherlands and Indonesia.\nLastly, we further strengthened our portfolio by advancing a significant refining capacity expansion on the U.S. Gulf Coast, discovering new resources in Guyana, progressing LNG production in Mozambique and addressing noncore assets with announced divestments totaling more than $3 billion.\nWe continue to invest through the pandemic with the understanding that demand would recover. With the Beaumont refinery expansion, we're on pace to increase our refining capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast by more than 17% or 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023.\nDuring the quarter, we also announced 2 discoveries in Guyana, adding to the estimated recoverable resource base, which is nearly 11 billion barrels. Natural gas began flowing at the Coral LNG project offshore Mozambique. The project remains on track to achieve the first LNG cargo later this year.\nFinally, we progressed our divestment program at an advantageous point in the cycle, announced asset sales include XTO Energy Canada, our Romanian upstream affiliate and our Barnett Shale gas assets. Barnett Shell divestment closed in the second quarter. The other 2 are anticipated to close later this year, subject to regulatory approvals.\nOverall, it was a very strong quarter in both financial results and in progressing our strategic priorities. The strong second quarter results reflect a tight global market environment where demand has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels and supply has attrited. The situation was made worse by the events in Ukraine, which have contributed to increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products.\nIn the first quarter, average Brent crude prices rose by about $22 per barrel. In the second quarter, Brent crude prices moved up by another $12 per barrel, pushing the benchmark marginally above the 10-year range. Natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges amid ongoing concerns about European supply.\nRefining margins are even more pronounced versus the 10-year range. They remain at very high levels, reflecting the significant impact on refining capacity resulting from the pandemic. In July, we saw some relief as margins moderated with improved supply and demand balances.\nGlobal chemical margins in contrast remain near the bottom of the cycle. However, we did see a slight improvement in the quarter, mainly in Asia Pacific. Margins in North America tightened during the quarter as product prices continue to lag the steep increases in ethane feedstock cost, consistent with higher gas prices.\nBefore recapping our financial results, let me touch on the market environment that underpins them. As I mentioned in my prerecorded remarks, large annual investments in oil and gas production are required to offset normal depletion, even more is required to grow net production. Prior to the pandemic, industry investments were below historical levels.\nThe economy-wide shutdowns during the pandemic exacerbated the problem. We are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. We clearly see the tightness in supply in refining, where the closure rate during the pandemic was 3x the rate of the 2008 financial crisis.\nGiven the long investment cycle times, growing supply will not happen overnight. At ExxonMobil, throughout this period, we stayed focused on the fundamentals and let our IOC peers in oil and gas investment. We leaned in when others leaned out, including investments in U.S. refining capacity, notably with our Beaumont refinery expansion.\nOur investments over the last 5 years are paying off today and helping to meet the needs of families everywhere with greater supply than otherwise would be the case. While progressing investments in our traditional businesses, we are also advancing a portfolio of opportunities consistent with our core capabilities in low-carbon solutions. We expect that these two will pay off in the years ahead for our shareholders and for our environment.\nWith that as a backdrop, let's turn to the second quarter financial results. Earnings totaled nearly $18 billion on increased production, higher liquids and natural gas realizations and strong refining margins. We continue to drive efficiencies with $6 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019. We remain on track to achieve more than $9 billion in savings by 2023.\nCapEx was $4.6 billion in the quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. We remain on track for our full year CapEx guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $20 billion, further strengthening our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to about 13%, while the growth ratio is now at 20%, the low end of our target range. We returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The increase in distribution reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and renewed strength of our balance sheet.\nI'll conclude with a few key takeaways. As I mentioned earlier, we are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. Our strong performance reflects the sizable investments we've been making over the past several years and our focus on the fundamentals. Those two things put us in a great position to deliver increased production at a time when the world needs it most.\nWe're continuing to increase production of low-cost barrels in Guyana and the Permian. We're doing all of this while maximizing output of our existing facilities, including a new daily production record set by PNG LNG in July. Our new Corpus Christi complex was cash and earnings positive in the first half of the year with the world-scale steam cracker demonstrating design capacity.\nOur U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity is poised to increase by about 250,000 barrels per day with the start-up of the Beaumont refinery expansion project in the first quarter of 2023. Two new LNG projects are also advancing. Coral LNG in Mozambique is set to deliver its first cargo in the second half of this year. Our Golden Pass LNG project, which will provide 18 million tons per year of new LNG supplies, remains on schedule to start up in 2024. Once completed, Golden Pass will increase LNG from the Gulf Coast by 20%.\nIn addition, we continue to divest nonstrategic assets at an opportune point in the cycle. We delivered strong safety and reliability, while controlling costs. These moves are improving our asset mix, lowering our breakevens and boosting our resiliency.\nOur Low Carbon Solutions business continues to grow our portfolio of opportunities with the 4 newly announced carbon capture and storage opportunities in Australia, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands. I'm extremely proud of the work our people are doing. All of their efforts are consistent with our strategic priorities, which our shareholders are being rewarded for.\nToday, with an even stronger balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest and to drive shareholder returns throughout the cycles. Our focus on the fundamentals is unchanged. We continue to leverage our core capabilities to advance our strategic priorities and to make the investments needed in this long-cycle business.\nWith our constancy of purpose and consistent approach, we will successfully address the dual challenge, providing energy and products modern societies need while lowering society's greenhouse gas emissions, leading industry in the energy transition.\nThank you.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, Darren. (Operator Instructions) With that, Jennifer, could you open up the line for questions, please?",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. Joining me today are Darren Woods, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe slides and our prerecorded remarks were made available on our Investors section of our website earlier this morning along with our news release. In a minute, Darren will provide opening comments and reference a few slides from that presentation, then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. We expect to conclude the call by about 9:30 a.m. Central Time.\nLet me encourage you to read our cautionary statement, which is on Slide 2. Please note, we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Darren Woods.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. As we laid out at our most recent Investor Day, our goal is to sustainably grow shareholder value through the execution of our strategic priorities seen on this slide. As we think about recent events, our job has never been clearer or more important. The need to meet society's evolving needs reliably and affordably is what consumers and businesses across the globe are demanding and what we delivered this quarter.\nFirst, we continue to build our competitively advantaged production portfolio, bringing new barrels to market today, driven in part by the high-value investments we continue to progress through the pandemic-driven downturn in prices. A prime example of the benefits of our continued investments is Guyana. This quarter saw the successful start of Liza Phase 2. Production is ramping up ahead of schedule and is expected to reach capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day by the third quarter this year. Combined with Liza Phase 1, it will bring our total production capacity in Guyana to more than 340,000 barrels per day.\nOur third project, Payara, is running ahead of schedule with startup now likely by year-end 2023. Yellowtail, the fourth and largest project to date on the Stabroek block, received government approval of our development plan, is on schedule to start up in 2025.\nFurther adding to our portfolio, we have made 5 new discoveries this year that have increased the estimated recoverable resources to nearly 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels.\nTurning to the U.S., we continue to grow production in the Permian Basin. In March, we produced about 560,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, on pace to deliver a 25% increase versus 2021. Looking forward, we're also growing our globally diverse portfolio of low-cost, capital-efficient LNG developments.\nIn Mozambique, the 3.4 million ton per year Coral South floating LNG production vessel is being commissioned after arriving on site in January. Coral South is on budget with the first LNG cargo expected in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition to investing in high-value opportunities in our existing businesses, we are also advancing opportunities in our Low Carbon Solutions business. During the quarter, we announced plans to build a large-scale hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. We anticipate the facility will have the capacity to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day. Combined with carbon capture, transport and storage of approximately 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, this facility will be a foundational investment in the development of a Houston CCS hub, which will have the potential to eliminate 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year and represents a meaningful step forward in advancing accretive, low-carbon solutions. We also reached a final investment decision to expand another important carbon capture and storage project at our helium plant in Wyoming. In addition, we received the top certification of our management of methane emissions at our Poker Lake development in the Permian. We're the first company to achieve this certification for natural gas production associated with oil.\nAt the end of the first quarter, we implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage the scale and integration of the corporation, improve the effectiveness of our operations and better serve our customers. We combined our Downstream and Chemical operations into a single Product Solutions business. This new, integrated business will be focused on developing high-value products, improving portfolio value and leading in sustainability.\nAs a result of these changes, our company is now organized along three primary businesses: Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions. These three businesses are supported by corporate-wide organizations, including projects, technology, engineering, operations, safety and sustainability.\nBefore I cover our financial results, I want to provide a perspective on the market environment.\nIn the first quarter, a tight supply-demand environment, primarily due to low investment levels during the pandemic, contributed to rapid increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. Clearly, the events in Ukraine have added uncertainty to what was already a tight supply outlook. Brent rose by about $22 per barrel or 27% versus the fourth quarter.\nToday, natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges driven by tight global market conditions and ongoing European supply concerns. The same tight supply-demand factors have also pushed refining margins near the top of the range.\nChemical margins in Asia have fallen sharply with product prices lagging the steep increases in feed and energy cost. In our case, the U.S. ethane feed advantage provided a significant positive offset versus this global view.\nWith that market environment as the backdrop, let me turn to our first quarter financials.\nEarnings totaled $8.8 billion, excluding an identified item, the after-tax charge associated with Sakhalin-1. As you know, we are discontinuing our Sakhalin-1 operations in Russia, which represented less than 2% of our total production last year, about 65,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, and about 1% of our corporate operating earnings. As the operator, our priority continues to be the health and safety of our people and the protection of the environment. Of course, we remain in full compliance with all U.S. sanctions and are closely coordinating with the U.S. administration.\nTurning to structural savings. We continue to drive further efficiencies, now delivering more than $5 billion of annual savings versus 2019.\nCapEx totaled $4.9 billion for the quarter, in line with our full year guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion.\nCash flow from operations was $14.8 billion, maintaining our strong balance sheet.\nOur debt-to-capital ratio remains in the low end of our 20% to 25% target range, while our net debt-to-capital ratio dropped to about 17%.\nWe returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, of which about 2/3 was in the form of dividends and the remainder share repurchases, consistent with our previous program.\nWe said during our corporate plan update in December that we expect to repurchase $10 billion of our shares. This morning, we announced an increase to the program, up to $30 billion in total through 2023. This move reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and the strength of our balance sheet.\nBefore I leave you with a few key takeaways, let me share one other decision we made this month with respect to our workforce.\nContinually investing in our people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities and essential to achieving our long-term objectives. As part of that effort, we are tripling the number of employees eligible for stock grants by bringing in high-performing employees at earlier stages of their careers. Our goal is to increase our people's ownership in the company and, importantly, in our financial and operating results.\nSecondly, in June, we will implement a 3% off-cycle compensation adjustment in the U.S. to maintain competitiveness. Our compensation and benefits programs are a key element of our total value proposition that enables us to continue to attract and retain the best talent in the industry.\nLet me leave you with a few key takeaways.\nWe had a strong first quarter, and I'm proud of the organization's progress. The impact of weather on the Upstream volumes and derivatives and timing impacts in the Downstream obscured a strong underlying performance. We anticipate an absence of these impacts and strong refining margins will position us very well in the second quarter.\nWe are making outstanding progress on our high-value growth developments in Guyana, the Permian and LNG. Our new Corpus Christi chemical complex is up and running ahead of schedule and generated positive earnings and cash flow in its first quarter of operations.\nWe have strengthened the balance sheet and are creating value for shareholders through an attractive dividend and increased share repurchases.\nWe are advancing hydrogen, biofuels and other low-carbon solutions, consistent with our intention to lead in the energy transition, leveraging our competitive advantages of scale, integration and technology.\nFinally, we are evolving our organization from a holding company to an operating company to better serve our customers' evolving needs and grow long-term shareholder value.\nBefore we take your questions, I want to acknowledge the very real impact the high prices are having on families all around the world. You may recall that we anticipated this in 2020 with industry investment levels well below those required to offset depletion. That's why we worked so hard to preserve our capital expenditures during the depths of the pandemic, ensure that additional production was available to meet the eventual recovery in demand. Today, that long-term focus is paying off with growing production of industry-advantaged supply.\nWe are continuing to focus on the fundamentals through ongoing investment in advantaged projects and low-emission initiatives to ensure that we can continue to meet the critical needs of people all around the world reliably and importantly well into the future.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nVP of IR, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, Darren.\nOne last piece of housekeeping I wanted to mention is that ahead of the segment reporting change next quarter, we plan to provide you annual and quarterly information for the past 5 years using the new reporting segments to assist you with your modeling. We plan to post the new data on our website around mid-June.\n(Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, please provide the instructions and then open the phone lines for the first question.",

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen A. Littleton\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Secretary, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today, Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kathryn Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The full set of presentation slides and prepared remarks are made available on the Investor Relations section of our website earlier this morning, along with our press release.\nDuring our call this morning, Darren will provide a few additional opening comments and reference a select number of slides from that presentation, leaving more time for your questions. We expect to conclude the call at 9:30 a.m. Central Time. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2, and through the supplemental information at the end of the presentation slides on the website. I'll now turn the call over to Darren.\n\nDarren W. Woods\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThanks, Stephen. It's a pleasure to share our 2021 results with you today, which demonstrates the significant progress we've made to advance our strategy and position the company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down cycle and structural cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefit of the market recovery last year. We delivered strong financial and operating performance, significantly increased earnings and cash flow to fund our advantaged investments, reduced debt to pre-pandemic levels and continued our long history of sharing our success with shareholders.\nToday, we'll outline some of our progress towards reaching our strategic goals to leading earnings and cash flow growth, drive to a net 0 future, build successful lower emissions businesses and maintain optionality in our portfolio to match the pace of the energy transition. Let me touch on a couple of key points. First, we're working to fully leverage our competitive advantages, including our scale to drive step changes in cost and efficiency. We're also actively managing our strong portfolio and continuing our keen focus on operating performance and disciplined capital and operating spend. We're also accelerating our work to reduce emissions and drive innovations focused on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry and commercial transportation. An important part of this activity is our ambition to achieve net zero emissions from our operations by 2050. Also important is the good progress we've made building our low carbon solutions business, which is rapidly expanding, utilizing existing policy. As you're all aware, we're also pursuing very large scale opportunities that will give us first-mover advantage as we advocate for the new policy necessary to support these step-out projects.\nOur results demonstrate the benefits of the actions we've taken. We're continuing to manage and evolve the company to further strengthen our competitive advantages growing value through the transition regardless of its pace.\nTurning now to some perspectives in 2021. As I said, we've made tremendous progress advancing our strategy over the past year. We remain focused on safety and reliability, delivering a second consecutive year of outstanding performance. In emission reductions, we expect to meet our 2025 reduction plans 4 years early. That led us to set even more aggressive plans for 2030. The experience we gained developing reduction road maps for our assets gives us confidence for what we can ultimately achieve. This helped form the basis of our recently announced ambition to achieve net zero emissions in our operations by 2050. Of course, a big part of our work in this area involved our low carbon solutions business. As I mentioned, this new business has made exceptional progress building a large inventory of new business opportunities, with a focus on carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels. Importantly, we're also addressing emissions by providing high-performance products to deliver solutions to help our customers reduce their emissions. Demand for these products was very strong in 2021, enabling 7% growth in our performance product volumes. This helps drive record annual earnings in our Chemical business.\nStrengthening our portfolio across all of our businesses continues to be a key part of our strategic focus to increase shareholder returns. To that end, we had more exploration success in Guyana, with 6 discoveries in 2021 and 2 additional discoveries already this year. This has expanded the estimated recoverable resources on the (inaudible) block to more than 10 billion oil equivalent barrels. And we're on schedule to start production this quarter at least at Phase 2. In the Permian, we continue to drive improvements in drilling and completions, increasing average production by nearly 100,000 oil equivalents per day to approximately 460,000. We started up the Corpus Christi chemical facility under budget and ahead of schedule. And we've continued to monetize noncore assets, generating more than $3 billion of cash proceeds from divestments during the year.\nOur actions are yielding strong results and, as I said, positioned us to benefit from demand recovery. We grew earnings to $23 billion and drove nearly $2 billion of structural efficiencies in 2021, on top of the $3 billion the year before. This puts us in a good position to significantly exceed our goal of $6 billion of structural cost savings per year by 2023 relative to 2019. We maintained our disciplined approach to investments, focused on competitively advantaged, low cost of supply opportunities and on growing our portfolio of high-value products. CapEx was $16.6 billion for the year, which was near the low end of our guidance.\nAs a result of our cost reductions, improved efficiency and capital discipline, we've lowered our Brent breakeven price to $41 per barrel. We're continuing to drive that down even more, expecting to average $35 a barrel between now and 2027. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $48 billion, the highest since 2012. We use the available cash to restore our balance sheet, essentially paying back what we borrowed in 2020, reducing our debt-to-capital ratio to about 21%. As a result of our restored financial strength, we increased the annual dividend for the 39th consecutive year and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that started last month. Overall, a strong list of accomplishments.\nNow looking ahead to this year. Our plan is robust and progresses our strategic objectives. I'll highlight a few key items on this page. First, we will increase our competitively advantaged, low cost of supply production with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 in Guyana and the Coral LNG development in Mozambique. The same is true for the Permian, where our focus remains on driving further capital efficiency and high-value growth. We're already ramping up manufacturing at Corpus Christi and expecting to start up our Baton Rouge polypropylene expansion later this year. These projects will continue to grow production of our high-value chemical performance products. We're applying the same capabilities and expertise developed over decades to progress our net zero ambitions and grow our low carbon solutions business. In that business, we expect to reach final investment decisions on large-scale carbon capture and storage projects at La Barge, Wyoming, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We're continuing to advance the flagship carbon capture opportunity in Houston. It now has 14 participating companies and has potential to capture up to 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. We also anticipate beginning to lift renewable diesel from our agreement with Global Clean Energy's biorefinery in California later this year as well as making a final investment decision on our renewable diesel project at our Strathcona refinery in Canada, expanding our lower emissions fuels offering.\nAnd finally, we expect to further strengthen our balance sheet and progress our share repurchase program while continuing to retain capital flexibility and optionality to adapt to market conditions and opportunities.\nLeveraging our core competitive advantages, we're well positioned for future success, irrespective of the path or pace. We have the flexibility to shift resources between our traditional and low-carbon businesses at any rate required. This provides a lot of optionality and positions us to lead industry in the energy transition and in earnings and cash flow growth. We thank you for joining us today and look forward to sharing more with you during our Investor Day on March 2. Unfortunately, because of ongoing COVID considerations, we'll conduct the events virtually again this year. We do look forward to the day when we can get back to hosting you all in person.\nBefore we take your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank Stephen for his leadership and significant contributions. As after 30 years of service, he will be retiring at the end of this month. I wish Stephen and his wife, Kim, the very best. You'll be missed. I'd also like to welcome Jennifer Driscoll, who will be joining later this month as our Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nStephen A. Littleton\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Secretary, Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\nThank you, Dan. Operator, please open the phone lines for the first question.",

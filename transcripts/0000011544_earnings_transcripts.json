So in addition to myself on this end of the phone, we also have Executive Chairman, William.\n[Audio Gap]\nIn any discussion that participants would like to engage in.\nBut before I hand it over to Rich, let me just as oftentimes I do state the obvious. And that is -- I think the past 90 days is just a continuation of clear evidence that the insurance industry is still a cyclical industry. And for whatever the reason may be, some would say, fear and greed. The industry continues to seemingly make an art out of self-bid when it comes to its own success. That having been said, we, as an organization, are not completely insulated from that, but we are able to mitigate that quite effectively because of how we what parts of the market, I should say, we focus on, particularly specialty and further more small accounts, which a lot of the challenge that continues to percolate and seems to be building momentum, again, we are somewhat protected from.\nSo let me leave it there. I'm going to hand it over to Rich, who'll run through some thoughts, and then we'll -- I will come back and offer a few more mines. Rich, please?\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. Appreciate it. Good evening, everyone. Third quarter results were excellent with a return on beginning of year equity of 24.3%, reflecting an increase in the prior year's quarter of almost 40% and net income, $511 million or $1.28 per share. Operating income increased 12% over the same period to $440 million or $1.10 per share, with a return on beginning of year equity of 21%. Further growth in underwriting and investment income drove the strong performance, combined with net investment gains.\nPretax quarterly underwriting income increased 8.2% to $287 million. Calendar year combined ratio was 90.9%, and the current accident year combined ratio ex cat was 88.4%. The Cat losses represented 2.5 loss ratio points or $79 million compared with the prior year of 3.3 loss ratio points or $98 million. Current accident year loss ratio ex cat for the current quarter was 59.9%, reflecting an increase over the prior year attributable to business mix, however, comparable to the second quarter of 2025. I\nDrilling down further, the Insurance segment's quarterly accident year loss ratio ex cat was relatively consistent with the first half of 2025 at 60.9% bringing the accident year combined ratio before cat to 89.3%. Reinsurance and monoline access segments, accident year loss ratio ex cat was 52.6% with a strong accident year combined ratio before cats of 82.4%.\nMoving to our top line. Quarterly net premiums earned continue to benefit from written growth, reaching another record of more than $3.2 billion. Gross and net premiums written were $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. Net premiums written grew in all lines of business in both segments. The comparable third quarter expense ratios were 28.5%, in addition to benefits from the growing net premiums earned on our expense ratio several of our recent start-up operating units are gaining scale and contributing favorably to the expense ratio.\nTechnology enhancements are also contributing to operational efficiencies. Our pretax quarterly net investment income grew to $351 million, driven by an increase in our core portfolio of 9.4%. As a reminder, 2024 did benefit from heightened Argentine inflation-linked income and excluding such income from both periods, would increase the core portfolio growth to 14.6% quarter-over-quarter. Fixed maturity portfolio had a book yield of 4.8%. We do expect investment income from our fixed maturity portfolio to grow in the foreseeable future due to strong operating cash flow of almost $2.6 billion on a year-to-date basis and new money rates comfortably above the roll-off of existing securities.\nThe duration of our fixed maturity portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents increased to 2.9 years in the third quarter while strengthening our AA- credit quality of our portfolio. Stockholders' equity reached a record of $9.8 billion, increasing 16.7% from the beginning of the year, driven by strong earnings an improvement of $428 million in our after-tax unrealized investment losses and currency translation losses as well as capital return of $362 million through ordinary and special dividends and share repurchases.\nAs of September 30, our after-tax unrealized investment losses included in stockholder equity decreased to $177 million, and our financial leverage has improved to historic low levels of 22.5%. We've continued to generate significant capital. company proactively refinanced its debt when interest rates were historically low, resulting in a low cost of capital and adding permanence to our capital structure with our nearest scheduled maturity in 2037.\nOur liquidity remains strong with almost $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents to invest. Book value per share before dividends and share repurchases grew 20.7% year-to-date. And 5.8% on a quarter-to-date basis.\nRob, with that, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOkay. Rich, thank you very much. So maybe just a couple of quick soundbites for me that perhaps will invite a bit of conversation later on. starting out with some observations regarding the market. The reinsurance marketplace, clearly, the property market, particularly property cat that bloom is off the road. From our perspective, there's still margin in the business. We'll see how long that lasts. It's without a doubt eroding. And to that end, you can feel the growing groundswell, but frankly, it's palpable around 1/1 and the appetite that's going to be coming from the reinsurance market. So we'll have to see what 1/1 holds.\nAs far as the liability side, again, from our perspective, and we've expressed this in the past, we've been a bit frustrated in the reinsurance marketplace, strong align in the sand and demonstrating some discipline, it would seem as though that reinsurers are dissatisfied with the underlying rate increases that their seasons are achieving from our perspective we think that there should be opportunity to push a little harder. That having been said, obviously, it endures to our benefit as a buyer of reinsurance.\nFlipping over to the insurance side, for the comments earlier, from our perspective, and again, using a very broad brush year, larger equals more competition, smaller equals less competition, which certainly bodes well for us. On the property front, highlighting that, clearly, the world of shared and layered, as we talked about, give or take, 90 days ago is where the competition is heating up the greatest -- it is also pronounced just in E&S in general. That having been said, from our perspective, clearly, the small admitted space as well as select parts of the homeowners market continue to offer attractive opportunity.\nNot different from what we've expressed in the past as well. The world of professional liability is very much a mixed bag -- on one hand, you have D&O that continues to erode, although at a slower rate from where it had been and the E&O market, generally speaking, is choppy. One of the brighter places, and by the way, it needs every drop of it and then some would be the world of HPL as an example, or hospital professional. As far as workers' compensation goes, Main Street comp from our perspective, consistent with what we shared with you in the past, tends to be particularly competitive. We have talked and talked and talked about California and certainly some of the challenges that market faces and happy to see the rate action coming through. A lot of that indigestion is being -- is coming about as a result of cumulative trauma and litigation stemming from that. GL, it would seem, at least from our perspective, for the moment, one is able to keep up with trend Auto has been on again and off again. I think it was the first quarter where we expressed a view that there were some green shoots. In the second quarter, it was a little less encouraging and quite frankly, it remains pretty choppy.\nA bit of a puzzle to me, and I believe, colleagues because there is no product line that has been more exposed to social inflation in our opinion than auto, but we'll have to see what happens with that. as far as our portfolio goes, and we can get into it later, we are reducing exposure. We're taking a lot of rate. And quite frankly, our top line is growing considerably less than our rate. Over to umbrella, again, not without its challenges for the marketplace. Clearly, the smaller end of town has been the better place to be. And in addition to that, the suggestion that the umbrella line has experienced disproportionately has been impacted by auto. Rich covered our quarter in some detail. So maybe just a couple of quick observations on that front from me. Top line up 5.5 rate ex comp coming in at 7.6 different folks can interpret that in whatever the way they wish to.\nBut from my perspective, it highlights the concept or the idea that this is an organization that is focused on rate adequacy. And to that end, we are very attuned to the fact that we are in business to make good risk-adjusted returns, not solely to issue insurance policies.\nYou would have seen some on the insurance front, growth in the short-tail lines, just to call a couple of pieces out, what's really driving that because you may be scratching your head saying, well, how do I reconcile this? What he was -- babbling about? As far as the property line and competition.\nThere's really 2 pieces that are driving that. One is our personal lines effort in Berkley One, that being the private client personal lines. where there is great opportunity, and we continue to lean into that. And in addition to that, our accident and health business continues to prosper as well.\nYou would have also perhaps taken note of the growth in the workers' comp line. That not dissimilar to what we've talked about in the past is really driven by specialty comp. Some of it tends to be higher hazard and so on and so forth. It is not Main Street comp.\nThe growth under the reinsurance banner, really, as far as the property piece goes, that's just us getting our last bite at the apple before the Apple starts to rot. We have a view as to rate adequacy and we have no problem drawing a line in the sand as we have demonstrated in the past. And as far as the excess line with the growth is coming from is primarily excess comp. Risk covers the loss ratio, the expense ratio. As far as the cat goes, that was really just SCS that gave us a little bit of noise there. The expenses, again, continue to be benefiting from our focus around automation, as Rich highlighted, but please understand we continue to make investments. So on occasion with the expense ratio, you will see us having to take half a step back in order to take multiple steps forward.\nFlipping over to the investment portfolio. And again, I'm not going to completely pile on what Rich has already covered, but I would just flag that the duration did nudge out to 2.9 years. And we feel as though that we have a fair amount of runway before us: a, as Rich highlighted, the strength of the cash flow continues to build the size of the portfolio. And in addition to that, we see the book yield continuing to go up from here. So just as a point of reference, the domestic book yield at the -- for the quarter was 4.6%, and our new money rate is, give or take, right about 5%.\nSo growth in the portfolio, higher new money equals runway ahead. By and large, it was a pretty solid quarter. And it wasn't just because the wind didn't blow in the earth and shake in a consequential way. It's because -- this is the trajectory that we're on, and it would take a lot to take us off that path. So when the day is all done, the underwriting opportunity continues to unfold. The discipline remains in place to ensure that, that margin is there. And our other economic engine being the investment portfolio, again, has much opportunity ahead of itself. So let me pause there.\nNicole, we are going to turn back to you, please, if we could open it up for questions. Thank you very much."

Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nAbby, thank you very much, and thank you to all participants for your time today and your interest in the company.\nIn addition to myself, you also have our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkley, on the call; as well as Rich Baio, our Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. He'll run us through some highlights from the quarter. He'll then pass it back to me. I'll offer a few more sound bites and then we look forward to taking people's questions and for that matter, taking the conversation and any direction participants wish to take it.\nBefore I do hand it over to Rich, perhaps just stating the obvious, it is very much an interesting moment in the property and casualty space. We are reminded of the complications of this industry, an industry where you make a sale before you ultimately truly know your cost of goods sold. We have been grappling with this reality as an industry forever. But there are moments in time when it comes into sharper focus than others. We certainly, over the past several years, have had to grapple with financial or economic inflation and that was combined with social inflation, which we have talked about, and I suspect we'll continue to talk about.\nBut while on the heels of COVID, financial or economic inflation seems to be brought far more under control, there are some real threats to that. Certainly, tariffs are top of mind for all of us. In addition to that, one should not lose sight of what's going on in the labor market and what that may mean for wage inflation over time, particularly around some of the administration policies that they are in the process of putting into place. And finally, there is the big question around deficits and what that will ultimately mean for the economy. And lastly, to what extent can we expect the U.S. consumers continue to be the driver and allow the economy to remain as resilient as it's been. These are amongst some of the macro questions that we are grappling with. Obviously, there's applicability to both our underwriting activities and how we think about selecting and pricing risk. And furthermore, I think it goes without saying there's meaningful applicability to the investment portfolio and how we think about positioning that.\nSo as always, lots of moving pieces trying to not just interpret what they all mean for today, but also how we think about positioning the business going forward. So let me pause there and hand it over to Rich, and I will follow him with a few more sound bites. Rich, over to you, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Rob.\nThe second quarter marked a continuation of strong performance in both underwriting income and net investment income. Net income per diluted share increased 8.7% over the prior year to $1 per share or $401 million with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 19.1%. The definition of operating earnings commencing with this quarter has been changed to exclude after-tax foreign currency gains and losses. And accordingly, operating earnings were $420 million or $1.05 per share yielding an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 20%.\nStarting with underwriting performance. Our current accident year combined ratio before cat losses of 3.2 loss ratio points was 88.4%, comprised of an accident year loss ratio excluding cats of 59.9% and an expense ratio of 28.5%. The calendar year combined ratio was 91.6%, resulting in $261 million of underwriting income. Cat losses were $99 million in the second quarter of 2025 compared with $90 million or 3.2 loss ratio points in the prior year's quarter. While the industry saw an above-average frequency of severe storms, the point impact of cat losses on our combined ratio remained flat even as the dollar amount of losses marginally increased with the growth in our property book of business over the prior year.\nDrilling down further, the Insurance segment's quarterly accident year loss ratio ex cat was relatively flat year-over-year and sequentially at 60.7%, bringing the accident year combined ratio before cats to 89%. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment's accident year loss ratio ex cat increased to 54.1% with a strong accident year combined ratio before cats of 83.8%. The expense ratio overall was flat at 28.5% and continue to benefit from the growth in net premiums earned, which was a quarterly record of $3.1 billion.\nIn addition, net premiums written increased to a record $3.4 billion in the quarter with growth in all lines of business in both segments. Record net investment income of $379 million benefited from the ongoing growth in the invested assets from strong operating cash flow and new money rates on fixed maturity securities that remain comfortably above our average book yield. Investment income from fixed maturity securities, excluding Argentine inflation linked securities improved 16.5% year-over-year with an increase in book yield of 20 basis points to 4.7%.\nOur investment funds performed above our expected quarterly range of $10 million to $20 million with strong results of $27 million, driven by transportation, infrastructure and financial services sectors. The quality of our portfolio remains very strong at AA- with the duration on our fixed maturity portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, increasing from the fourth quarter of 2.6 years to the current quarter of 2.8 years. Foreign currency losses in the quarter of $55 million related to the weakening U.S. dollar relative to most other currencies.\nOffsetting this income statement loss is an improvement in the currency translation loss and stockholders' equity of $69 million. The effective tax rate was 23.2% in the quarter, which is in line with our expectations for the full year of 2025. The rate exceeds the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to taxes on foreign earnings at higher rates and state income taxes. Stockholders' equity increased by more than $380 million or 4.3% over the first quarter of 2025 to a record $9.3 billion. After-tax unrealized investment losses improved by $120 million to a balance of $249 million as of June 30, 2025.\nFrom a capital management perspective, we paid ordinary and special dividends of $224 million in the quarter, bringing our growth in book value per share before dividends to 6.8% in the quarter and 14.3% on a year-to-date basis. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of more than $2 billion and historically low financial leverage of 23.4%.\nSo in summary, another great quarter with exceptional risk-adjusted returns and excellent underwriting and investment performance. Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nGreat. Rich, thank you very much.\nSo maybe just to follow on Rich's comments, a couple of additional thoughts. First, I think as everyone on the call is acutely aware, this is still very much a cyclical industry. As we have discussed in the past, though, one of the changes that has happened over the past, I don't know, sort of 5 to 10 years is a decoupling of product lines as to where they are in the cycle. So the cyclical nature still exists, but where different major product lines are in the cycle, they are certainly no longer in lockstep.\nTo that end, a couple of thoughts on the insurance marketplace. One, the property market. Clearly, that marketplace is becoming more competitive as we have discussed for a couple of quarters now. Probably 2 drivers there: one would be a reinsurance marketplace that is becoming more competitive and is willing to provide capacity at a lower rate; and the second piece is as discussed by some of the MGA market, which is becoming clearly more active. And I'll offer a few thoughts on the MGA market a little bit later in my comments. I would tell you that the property market there is a notable bifurcation while the general direction is more competitive. The larger accounts, particularly shared and layered, as we've discussed in the past couple of quarters is where greater competition is the smaller accounts, it's not that there isn't competition, but it pales in comparison to the larger end of town.\nAs far as commercial transportation, again, another product line where there is a fair amount of activity coming from MGAs. That marketplace, we continue to and others seem to be pushing for rate, but without a doubt, the MGA participants are creating at least a short-term headwind for that market truly going hard. My expectation is that, that's a bit of a kink in the hose, if you will, and consequently, it is going to build up pressure and ultimately, we'll inure to the benefit of responsible long-term participates when that snaps and the market shifts.\nProfessional liability, again, a bit of mix -- of a mixed bag as we all have a shared appreciation, a very broad space. Just a couple of highlights on D&O. It would seem as though the public D&O market is beginning to find some sense of bottom private and non-for-profit D&O remains particularly competitive as some of, what I would, define as miscellaneous there is, again, an MGA component to it since people seem to be very fixated on the topic. I thought I'd flag that as well.\nAs far as the casualty lines, clearly, there is opportunity to get the rate that the product line needs. It is pronounced both in the primary casualty as well as the umbrella and Excess.\nAnd finally, as far as workers' compensation goes, presumably all had an opportunity to take note of the action coming out of California. I think some time ago, we had flagged for those that were willing to listen that it seemed as though California as opposed to in the more distant past, this time around is out in front of the rest of the market as far as firming. I think the action taken by the commissioner approving 8.7% effective 09/01 is certainly a strong message that was well received by us, and we look forward to more coming behind that.\nI think one other comment I would make would be around the consumer space, particularly P&C personal lines. As you all know, we have a meaningful participation in the private client space, which is a very different business from what I would define as mass market. It is a part of the market that is built or driven by knowledge and expertise. And we have a business that is really coming into its own in that space and has been a great contributor, not just to the top line but to the bottom line as well. And those market conditions remain ripe and we are pleased to have that opportunity. I mentioned reinsurance earlier as far as the reinsurance marketplace, providing capacity within the property lines, perhaps the discipline, I think, eroding. I think we've talked about that in the past. It continues to erode. We'll have to see how quickly it remains, and what -- how steep the trajectory is, I should say.\nAnd finally, we've expressed our disappointment with the discipline, particularly on the casualty lines within the reinsurance space. I offered a couple of sound bites about MGAs just as a broad category earlier. And within the industry, people tend to oftentimes use some terminology, perhaps somewhat casually and almost interchangeably, around MGA, MGU and ultimately really falls under the category, if you like, of delegated authority. There is no doubt that inherently in many of the delegated authority models, there is a mismatch or a lack of alignment of interest between those with the pen and those with the capital. It is not that all of these relationships are bad, some of them are quite good, one just needs to have their eyes wide open and understand that it is not a perfect alignment of interest and make sure that it is controlled appropriately.\nThat having been said, there has been extraordinary growth in the MGA space. A lot of it has been generated by new entrants that lack expertise. A lot of it has been supported by reinsurance capacity that seems to have an unquenchable thirst for growth without necessarily their finger fully on the pulse. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think for many of us that have been around for at least a little while, and those that have been -- particularly those that have been around for a long while, have seen some version of this movie.\nIn some ways, it's the same and other ways, it's different. Perhaps the only difference is that it's a different test of characters. One final anecdote on the MGA front, I would tell you that over the last 60 to 90 days, it's been a startling number of inbound calls that we have gotten from investment bankers suggesting that MGAs that they have to sell, would we be interested in buying them. And typically, they are capitalized or owned by private equity.\nSo oftentimes, perhaps a leading indicator that the music is slowing and we'll see who has a seat at the end, though oftentimes, that does take some time. Rich, as always, did a really thorough job as it relates to the quarter and the numbers, I would just call out the rate at the 7.6% ex comp continues to be meaningful and puts us in a comfortable place. Rich talked about the loss ratio. Again, I'm not going to go into a chapter and [indiscernible]. The 3.2 points of cat was really frequency by industry standards, modest severity.\nAnd then lastly, you would have -- it's worth noting the duration of the investment portfolio edging out to 2.8 years. Again, I think this is exactly what we suggested we would be doing if the story unfolded the way it has. We continue to believe that our strategy is the right one, making sure that we are getting an appropriate risk-adjusted return.\nI think as Rich alluded to, the cash flow of the organization remains very healthy. The growth in the investment portfolio remains quite significant. And if you think about a new money rate for us today is running about, give or take, 5.25 and the book yield on the portfolio ex Argentina is 4.7%. That certainly bodes well for where investment income is going for the foreseeable.\nSo long story short, we can't control the environment, but we can control our actions. We remain very focused on making good risk-adjusted returns, the decoupling of product lines and how they make their way through the cycle, combined with the breadth of our offering allows us to continue to grow when others perhaps are experiencing more of a headwind. In our opinion, you certainly are seeing different product lines at different points of transition. We have historically and continue to be more of a liability market, and we think that much of the liability market is where the opportunity will likely be over the next 12 to 36 months.\nSo again, we think we're well positioned on the underwriting side. We think we're well positioned on the investment side, and it is our expectation that we will be able to continue to grow earnings in a very thoughtful and controlled manner.\nSo with that, Abby, I will take a pause, and we're very pleased to open it up for questions. Thank you."

But also, we shouldn't forget about the many people that were terribly impacted during the 2024 year as a result of hurricanes and other events. From our perspective, it is certainly a moment for the industry to demonstrate its value to society.

The 2024 full year closed out with record top line and bottom line results, yielding return on equity of 23.6% and operating return on equity of 22.4%. The fourth quarter record operating earnings increased 15.5% to $453 million or $1.13 per share, with an operating return on equity of 24.3%. Net income represented our second best quarter, increasing 45% to $576 million or $1.44 per share with return on equity of 30.9%. The key drivers behind the quarter were strong underwriting results, combined with the continuation of growth in our core investment portfolio.\nStarting with underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio before cat losses of 2.6 loss ratio points was 87.7%, consistent with the full year 2024. The calendar year combined ratio was 90.2% resulting in $294 million of underwriting income, bringing the full year 2024 to 90.3% and a record underwriting income of more than $1.1 billion. The prior year development was favorable by $1.6 million in the quarter. Drilling down further into the component parts, the current accident year loss ratio ex cat was 59.2%, which ticked up slightly from the prior year due to business mix and remains flat to the full year's 2024 and 2023.\nCat losses increased over the prior year, primarily due to Hurricane Milton, driving the increase quarter-over-quarter of 1.4 loss ratio points. The expense ratio of 28.4% was flat to the prior year quarter continuing to benefit from record net premiums earned of more than $3 billion and initiatives driving technological and operational efficiencies throughout the business. We believe 2025 will reflect an expense ratio comfortably below 30%. The full year 2024 marked another record year on top line. The gross to net premiums written grew 9.6% to 9.3%, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Insurance segment's net premiums written increased 9.9% and to more than $2.6 billion with growth in all lines of business. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment grew in property and monoline excess with a decrease in casualty due to the competitive pricing environment. Moving on to investments. The core portfolio increased 9.4% to $313 million. We do expect the core portfolio to continue to grow over the fourth quarter 2024 and in the foreseeable future due to higher new money rates compared with the roll-off book yields and growth in the size of the investment portfolio.\nOur record operating cash flow from 2024 and of almost $3.7 billion followed the year before is operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, which was also a record and has enabled us to invest more while maintaining the high credit quality of AA-. In addition, we've increased our investment duration from 2.4 years to 2.6 years in the quarter. And at the end of 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of almost $2 billion. Net investment gains were primarily driven by favorable market value movements in common and preferred equity securities.\nInvestments in the energy and certain financial services sectors led to the $163 million unrealized gain. The effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter benefited from the utilization of some foreign valuation allowances established against operating loss carryforwards and true up adjustments for prior periods. This brings our full year effective tax rate to 22.5%, and we expect 2025 will be 23%, plus or minus. As it relates to capital, the stockholders' equity increased 12.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily due to record net income of $1.8 billion partially offset by the return of capital to shareholders of $836 million through dividends and share repurchases.\nIn the fourth quarter, we paid regular and special dividends of $220 million and repurchased $67 million in shares. Our after-tax unrealized investment loss is $517 million as of year-end 2024 and an improvement of $69 million from the prior year. And finally, book value per share before repurchases and dividends grew 23.5% for the full year.\nRob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOkay. Rich, thank you very much. Very clear. I'm sure it is appreciated by all. So before I offer a few thoughts on the marketplace and then on our quarter, just highlighting the obvious at this stage as you've likely had an opportunity to flip through the release and would have heard Rich's comments 2024 was truly another exceptional year for the organization.\nAnd I did -- before we get into [indiscernible] that we typically do on these calls, I did want to take a moment just to pause -- and both thank and congratulate roughly 7,300 colleagues for yet again a job very well done. The three of us have the privilege of speaking on behalf of the full team. But as a reminder to all, this is a team sport, and the outcome is a reflection of the team, not just the folks that happen to be speaking to you on this call today. So again, to the team, thank you. And I truly congratulations on yet another great performance.\nMaybe pivoting over to a couple of thoughts on the marketplace. As far as much of the liability market, it continues to be plagued by social inflation. The combination of an emboldened plaintiff bar along with, quite frankly, this jet fuel that they have in their back pocket, otherwise known as litigation funding continues just to up the game. That having been said, social inflation does not apply to all product lines equally. So maybe to give an example or to be more specific, while it is certainly prevalent in most places within the liability space, if you look at certain lines of business where claims are more exposed or is more commonplace where there is actually physical injury to someone, you will see a reaction coming out of a jury that tends to be far more inflated.\nBy example, the type of awards that are coming out related to auto liability or med mal and the inflation that we are seeing in those types of claims is far more than what we would be seeing in the D&O space or what we would be seeing in the accountants liability space, just to pick a few to try and articulate the point. One of the things that's been both surprising and quite frankly, a bit disappointing to me has been how slow or sluggish the reinsurance market has been to respond to social inflation and some of the challenges. It is our suspicion that you are seeing a gradual groundswell that is building, and we will see discipline coming to the casualty reinsurance market, hopefully, over the coming months and years, and that will create an opportunity for our colleagues in the reinsurance space.\nBut in the meantime, when there is that lack of discipline, we very much applaud our colleagues for the discipline that they are exercising. Pivoting over to the short tail lines, specifically property, certainly for the moment, and we'll have to see what the impact of the California fires is. But for the moment, property insurance, there is still a tailwind, but it is slowing. And if you pivot over to the property reinsurance market and even more so the retro market, it is clear that at 1/1, there was no tailwind to be found. In fact, it was quite to the contrary, there was a growing headwind. By example, our property cat renewal risk adjusted was down 15%-ish and a similar percentage for our retro.\nMoving on to our quarter. I don't have a lot to add. And I guess, at the risk of being a little bit repetitive following Rich. The net written premium yet was 8%. But going back to a comment earlier and what Rich had unpacked for us a little bit, I think you need to look at that a little more carefully. And the fact of the matter is if you back out the casualty reinsurance where we find market conditions, to be concerning, and we believe that more of a defensive posture is appropriate. If you back that out, we're at 10%. Rate [ ex ] workers' comp came in at 7.7%, renewal retention ratio, a little bit above 80%, which continues to be very consistent with what it's been for at this stage. I don't know how many quarters or for that matter, how many years.\nOn the expense front, the $284 million, Rich talked about us continuing to be sub-30% for the foreseeable Rich, this is a little bit of a heads up. I'm going to ask you to talk about expenses for a moment. But if you go back and you look at the journey that we've been on we've been able to hold the line on expenses through investment in technology, along with the utilization of BPO, and if you think about where our expense ratio was pre COVID and where we are today, even with the COVID benefit on expenses and gone away, we continue to be in a very good place. So I'm going to keep going in a minute, but I'm going to take a pause, catch my breath and Ritchie, if you want to speak to expenses for a moment, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nSure. So as Rob alluded to, certainly, post-COVID, we've benefited where our expense ratio has been in the low 20s to mid-20 -- low 28% to 28.5% area. But preceding that, going back to 2020 and prior certainly began with a 3 handle. And if we go back to the decade ago, basically at $33 and change. So certainly, have seen close to a 5-point improvement in the expense ratio over that period of time.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nAnd I would just add to that, one needs to keep in mind our mix of business and a meaningful amount of the business we has an acquisition cost that is greater due to the fact that we do a fair amount of business in the wholesale market. So Rich covered the combined ratio, again, a 90.2% given the cat activity in the quarter, not a bad place to come out just speaking of that on the topic of tests. Obviously, it's very early to be speculating around California and what it will mean. But I would just remind folks that we are California light when it comes to property.\nObviously, one of the areas that has gotten a lot of attention is the personal line space. And the -- our efforts known as Berkley One, within the private client personal line space, we do not participate in the California market. So hopefully, that is helpful. And I think the punchline is, while I'm sure we will have some loss activity associated with the fires I expect that it will not keep us from still delivering a respectable return to our shareholders in Q1 based on everything that I can see today. [indiscernible] over to the investments. Again, Rich covered this the AA- continues to get stronger with every passing day, and we're feeling very good about that.\nSimultaneously, you would note as Rich flagged the duration, we've talked about this for some number of quarters. When we see the opportunity, we're going to nudge that duration out. We saw an opportunity. So [indiscernible] 2.4 and change, that's 2.6 and change. And again, we feel no pressure. But when we see the window of opportunity, our colleagues are not going to let that pass by without taking advantage of it. I think another data point that really plays into the whole economic model. And I think as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters, when we were going through an extended period of time and interest rates were reduced or depressed, if you will.\nI think a lot of us forgot about the component of our economic model, that being the investment portfolio and investment income. Obviously, that has been reawoken. Everyone can see that. But that story is not fully told at this stage. So a couple of data points for you. Our domestic book yield for the quarter was approximately 4.6%. Our new money rate today is 5.4% plus. So as you can see, that increase along with the cash flow that Rich talked about for the year of $3.7 billion or $81 million in the quarter. We have a growing portfolio where new money rate is considerably above the book yield, and I think we all know what that means.\nSo long story short, what's the punchline? It's the following. 2025 is a year that we think the table is already set and it's set in a very attractive way. And with every passing day, we're setting the table more and more for 2026. The reality is that our underwriting margin is likely to improve from here over time and certainly, at a minimum, will not be deteriorating. In addition to that, as far as the investment portfolio, the other key component of our economic model, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the investable assets continue to grow at a healthy pace. And that new money rate, given our view on where, quite frankly, government borrowing is going to need to be where inflate is going to be. There will continue to be an opportunity for us to put me to work at a healthy spread above the current book yield as it is today, we do not see that disappearing overnight.\nSo obviously, people will digest and process the data anyway they like but the numbers and the information that we shared with you all today, those are statements of fact. And quite frankly, you don't need to be particularly insightful to see how the story is likely to unfold not just over the 25-year but more and more likely with every passing day, 26 and perhaps beyond.\nOkay. That was, as usual, probably more than I promised. Why don't we pause there and Lisa, if we could go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

Berkley Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded.\nThe speaker's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, some of which forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including, without limitation, believes, expects or estimates. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, in 2023 and our other filings made within the SEC for a description at a business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results.\nW.R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nKrista, thank you very much. We appreciate you getting us through that marathon of a safe harbor statement. And good afternoon to all, and welcome to our Q2 call. Thank you for finding the time and thank you for the interest in the company. Along with me on the call, you have Bill Berkley, Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the group. We are going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. They'll run through some highlights for you all. We'll then flip it back to me. I'll offer a few of my own observations on both the industry as well as our quarter, and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A.\nBefore I hand it to Rich, I guess, perhaps stating the obvious, clearly, an active quarter of frequency of what I would define as severity, but perhaps relatively modest severity on the property front. From our perspective, it was an opportunity for this organization to differentiate itself as it does when there is severity on the property market front. And in spite of all the challenges, we were still able to deliver a 91 combined. I guess for those that drive to the [ But 4 club ], it would be an 88. But when we look at the goal of the exercise being to generate good risk-adjusted returns, to build the book value, we are of the view that cat do count and so does net development.\nIn our opinion, it's not just about the steps forward that you take. It's also about the steps backwards that you will avoid and that is very much woven into how we approach the business on all fronts. So with that, I will hand it to Rich and I will follow him in a couple of minutes, Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOf course. Thanks, Rob, and good evening, everyone. The company continued to perform well with the second quarter annualized return on beginning of year equity of 20% on a net income basis and 22.4% on an operating earnings basis. References to per share information in my comments and the earnings release have been adjusted for the 3 for 2 common stock split effect on July 10. Operating income increased approximately 35% to $418 million or $1.04 per share, driven by strong underwriting and investment income.\nGrowth of 11.2% and net premiums written to a record $3.1 billion represents the first time above $3 billion a quarter and provides the opportunity for continued record setting net premiums earned beyond this quarter. The U.S. dollar strengthened to many foreign currencies in the quarter, adversely impacting the growth rate by approximately 90 basis points and accordingly would have been 12.1% excluding the foreign currency impact. We grew in both segments of our business, led by the Insurance segment with 12.2% growth on adjusted for foreign currency. And Reinsurance and Monoline Excess segment increased 3.5% led by property.\nPretax underwriting income was $254 million, which included $90 million of catastrophe losses or 3.2 loss ratio points heightened catastrophe events during the quarter led to the increase in cat losses of 1.1 loss ratio points over the prior year quarter, well below what we expect will impact the industry. Our careful and prudent management of cat risks has continued to result in stability in earnings. Our accident year loss ratio, excluding cats, is 59.4%, slightly below the prior year's 59.5%.\nThe prior year accident development was favorable by $1 million, combined with the previously mentioned cat losses, brings our calendar year loss ratio to 62.6%. The expense ratio increased 40 basis points to 28.5% and primarily due to higher commissions from business mix and is relatively flat to the sequential quarter. We remain confident with our guidance that the expense ratio should be comfortably below 30%.\nRecord pretax net investment income increased almost 52% to $372 million. The fixed maturity securities continue to drive results quarter-over-quarter with an increase of more than $100 million. In addition, net investment income from investment funds improved to $25 million in the quarter. The record operating cash flow through the first 6 months of $1.6 billion combined with the ability to reinvest the roll-off of existing securities at higher yields should continue to drive growth in net investment income quarter-over-quarter for the foreseeable future.\nThe credit quality of the investment portfolio and duration remains at a AA- in 2.5 years for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 23.7% and will likely remain at this level through the remainder of the year due to the contribution of foreign earnings taxed at rates greater than the U.S. statutory rate of 21%.\nTurning to capital management. The company returned total capital of $381 million, consisting of $224 million of share repurchases, $127 million of special dividends and $30 million of regular dividends. Stockholders' equity increased 4.2% from the beginning of the year to $7.8 billion, while book value per share of $20.42 grew 5.4% over the same period. Book value per share before share repurchases and dividends grew 4.7% in the quarter and 9.7% on a year-to-date basis.\nWith that, Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Rich. That was great. A couple of comments from me, maybe starting on the more macro in the industry and within touch on our quarter as promised. So from my perspective, the industry continues to be one that responds to pain. Pain is the catalyst for discipline and change. We see that from one product to another. I guess perhaps the one analogy would be the cast may change, but generally speaking, the script does not change. Unfortunately, it's somewhat predictable.\nSpeaking of change, certainly, we are seeing a bit of a tempering on the financial and economic inflation front. That having been said, social inflation shows no sign of abating. Social inflation is something that we have been very actively and loudly talking about going back to 2018 when we started to alarm and share with people what we were seeing in loss trend.\nOne of the challenges, particularly as of late and it's really in much of the country is there's a bit of resistance to -- in amongst many insurance departments and allowing carriers to get rate filings that they need to keep up with loss cost trend. That consequently has been creating and continues to create an opportunity in the specialty lines, in particular, the E&S lines as the standard market is not able to get their rates to where they need to be, again, given what trend is driven by social inflation.\nI'm not going to get into every nook and cranny of every major commercial line, but I will flag that auto liability continues to be an area of concern. And obviously, by extension, that can feed into the umbrella line. From our perspective, when you talk about social inflation, there is no product line that is more exposed than auto liability these days.\nTurning to our quarter. As Rich covered earlier, I would just point out the growth was up by 11.4%. As you mentioned, the net was up by 11.2%. The big delta there was a couple of fold. One was our captive business, which continues to do exceptionally well. A few new operations that we started and when they're in their infancy and don't have much balance to them, we'll maybe be more dependent on the reinsurance buy. And lastly, there was a moment post 1/1, but before everyone started to turn their attention to what could be a very active wind season, the ILW market softened a little bit, and we took advantage of that.\nAs Rich mentioned, the 11.2% on the top line was reasonably healthy growth. The rate coming in at 8.3x comp from our perspective should give comfort to that as it gives to us that we have been up of the trend. That having been said, rate is important, but it's not the whole story. One needs to be conscious of what's happening with terms and conditions if you would remind all of us that oftentimes terms and conditions can have a greater impact than rate on the [ FMO ] of underwriting.\nIn addition to that, something that we talk about from time to time, but it's coming into sharper and sharper focus. And that is how there are certain territories or jurisdictions or venues that as far as a legal environment or a legal climate are changing and changing very rapidly. So there are certain territories that once upon a time, politically were read and that was still over sort of legal environment. We are seeing those change. And I wouldn't say that they're bright blue, but they are certainly evolving to something that's more of a shade of purple from our perspective.\nRich touched on the expense ratio. Again, reasonably stable there. Obviously, as he had mentioned earlier in the year and again, touched on in his comments a few moments ago, new businesses that we started that are in their infancy are now incorporated into that until the critical mass there a bit of a drag on the expense side. And in addition to that, we're making some pretty chunky investments on the tech front. As well as the data and analytics front.\nLoss ratio, the 66%, again, not bad given the time of year and what's going on with SCS and related. That having been said, we are always looking to try and improve upon that. There's a lot of chatter in the marketplace at the moment around losses. And specifically around reserves. Look, when the day is all done, there's one of the great challenges of this industry is you sell your product before you know your cost of goods sold. None of us know what tomorrow will bring. None of us know what a jury is going to do. That having been said, as we have commented countless times over the past several years, particularly in light of the commentary the questioning and occasionally, the chart size that we've received for in spite of all the rate we've gotten, how is it that you are not dropping our loss yet. Our response has been consistently that we have a respect for the unknown. We have an appreciation for what's going on with social inflation and consequently, early on, we are going to hold our picks at a higher level, and they will season out over time as we have more information.\nA couple of data points that I thought could be possibly helpful is, the paid loss ratio continues to run in the mid-40s. When we look back at how much rate we have gotten since 2019, all lines, ex comp on the insurance front are approximately 68% as cumulative, of course.\nAnd finally, another data point since some people have suggested that the paid loss ratio tells part of the story, because your business is growing. I would add to that, much of the business as growth has been due to rate. But nevertheless, I would suggest that people could look at a different data point and it would be helpful to them. That being initial IBNR relative to net earned premium.\nAnd if you go back in time and you look at that data, which we have, if you look at sort of the '16 to '19 period, that was running at somewhere between 31% and 34-ish percent. If you look at '20 to '23, that's running between 37.5% and 39%. So people think about the strength of our loss reserves, perhaps that would be a helpful data point.\nPivoting over to the investment portfolio. Rich touched on this earlier, duration 2.5 strong AA-. The domestic book yields come in at 4.5 and the new money rate in spite of all the chatter around interest rates and where they're so on and so forth, still starts with a 5. And I would tell you, it's probably flirting with 5.25 these days. Our cash flow remains strong for the quarter. It was $880 million, $1.6 billion for the first half of the year.\nMaybe taking a half step back on a little more of a macro front. I think some people have taken note that we played it reasonably well in how we position things for this rising interest rate environment after the quick acknowledgment of that, I think attention quickly turns to. So what are you doing now? What are you doing to make sure you set the table appropriately for tomorrow? And to make a long story short, we have a view that regardless of who ends up in the White House and regardless of who's sitting in what seat in Washington, D.C. this country has a serious issue with deficit and fundamentally a serious issue with spending. So there is nothing that leads us to believe that, that is going to be curtailed anytime soon.\nThat having been said and what compounds the challenge is that some of the largest buyers of U.S. treasuries that being foreign buyers, specifically China and Japan, it's reasonably apparent that they, along with other foreign buyers, the appetite may not be there.\nSo when you put all of this together, our view is that even if short-term rates come down, you are likely to see the yield curve uninverted. And that will provide an opportunity for us to nudge our duration out. Obviously, around the election, there's a lot of commentary and speculation as to what leaders that will be in the White House, will be doing going forward. I would just add the observation from our perspective if we find ourselves in a situation where an administration takes a different view around innovation, and we find ourselves further in a situation where certain parts of the labor market are no longer here to do those jobs, that will likely lead to greater inflation. Additionally, the idea of tariffs does quite frankly, all it does is raise the cost products that will likely lead to inflation as well.\nJust pivoting quickly on capital. Rich touched on the capital we've been returning. When the day is all done, the company at this stage for the foreseeable, we think, is going to be growing 10% to 15%. Could there be a quarter where we do a little more, a quarter, we do a little less? Absolutely, but that's sort of the strike zone as we see it. But at the same time, we're generating returns and give or take, high teens, low 20s pretty consistently, and there's a lot of visibility around that from our perspective. So our ability to return capital for the foreseeable is robust.\nWhen you layer that on top of, I think that the view, if you take a close look at the analysis, any of the agencies have done we are an exceptionally strong place to begin with. So we'll have to see what tomorrow brings, but there is a lot of flexibility that the organization enjoys at this stage.\nSo I will pause there. And Krista, we would be pleased to open it up for questions. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nAudra, thank you very much. And let me echo your words earlier with a warm welcome to all that are participating in the call today. We appreciate your time and look forward to discussing with you our Q1 '24 results. In addition to myself, we also have Bill Berkley on the call, Executive Chairman; and Rich Baio, Chief Financial Officer. And we are going to follow our typical agenda where I'm going to be handing it over to Rich shortly, he will be running through the highlights. Once he's completed his comments, I'll follow along with a few additional thoughts and then we will be pleased to open it up for [indiscernible] comments discussion.\nBefore I do hand it over to Rich, I think anyone who's had an opportunity to flip through the earnings release would understand already, but I'll say it regardless that we had a very strong and solid quarter, a great way to start the year. And when you really look at the results and unpack it a little bit as we'll be doing over the next hour or so, it's pretty clear that the business firing on any cylinders or essentially all cylinders at this stage. Rich, again, we'll get into some details. And while there are a couple of moving pieces in the investment portfolio that narrate some conversation or discussion. I think the overall story is that whether it's on the investment side or on the underwriting side, business continues to benefit from the foundation that was poured yesterday.\nWe continue to pour today and position the business for continued success. This is really a result of the whole team. And in particular, I think it's worth noting the level of expertise, the focus and as important as anything, the discipline that exists on both the underwriting part of the business as well as the investment part of the business. So for us, we're pleased with the quarter. Rich is going to give you some more detail on it. In addition to that, we're probably even more enthusiastic because of how we see the business unfolding not just for the balance of this year, but with every passing day, we are laying the groundwork for what '25 and beyond will look like as well.\nSo with that, let me hand it to Rich, and he will share with us some of his thoughts on the quarter. Rich, good morning.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it. As you mentioned, we're off to a terrific start in 2024 with record quarterly operating income, driven by record net investment income and our best first quarter underwriting income. Operating income increased 53.4% to $423 million or $1.56 per share, with an annualized operating return on beginning of year equity of 22.7%. And Net income increased 50.4% to $442 million or $1.64 per share, with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 23.7%.\nOur growth in net premiums written accelerated to 10.7% to a record of almost $2.9 billion. Rate improvement and exposure growth continued to contribute to the increase in our top line. Before discussing the segment results, we reclassified a program management business from the Insurance segment to the reinsurance and monoline access segment. This reclassified business has similar characteristics to one of our reinsurance operations already in the reinsurance and monoline access segment and has common management for both operations. And accordingly, reclassifications have been made to the company's 2023 financial information to conform this presentation.\nHaving said that, the Insurance segment increased net premiums written by 11.9% to more than $2.4 billion, and the reinsurance and monoline excess segment increased 4.2% to more than $400 million. Pretax underwriting income increased 31.8% to $309 million. And our calendar year combined ratio improved 1.8 points from the prior year to 88.8%. The current accident year combined ratio ex cats was flat year-over-year at 87.7%. A reduction in the current accident year catastrophe losses contributed to a benefit of 80 basis points to the calendar year loss ratio of 60.2%.\nCat losses were $31 million or 1.1 loss ratio points in the current quarter versus $48 million or 1.9 loss ratio points in the first quarter of 2023. Combining this improvement, along with the prior year favorable development of approximately $1 million, brings our first quarter 2024 accident year loss ratio ex cats to 59.1%. The slight uptick in the ratio from the prior year is due to business mix. The expense ratio improved 20 basis points to 28.6% due to a nonrecurring benefit associated with compensation. We remain confident that our 2024 full year expense ratio should be comfortably below 30% even with the previously announced new start-up operating unit expenses.\nPretax net investment income grew 43.2% to a record $320 million in the current quarter. Our core portfolio increased more than 63%, which was influenced by Argentine inflation linked securities. We don't expect the remainder of 2024 to benefit significantly from much of these securities which have matured in the first quarter. Partially offsetting this benefit is a loss of $29 million from investment funds.\nAs you may recall, we report investment funds under 1 quarter lag. And since our first quarter represents the fourth quarter of the year for investment funds, we believe their mark-to-market process is more rigorous due to financial statement audits. The two primary fund strategies for the current quarter's loss were transportation and financial services. To synthesize this down for the second quarter of 2024, we expect investment funds will have less impact from mark-to-market and perform more like they did in the fourth quarter of 2023 as we expect the Argentine inflation linkers to do as well.\nWe had very strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the first quarter, an increase of almost 68% compared with last year. The combination of new money rates above the roll-off yield on our fixed maturity portfolio and increasing investable asset base, the company is well positioned for our future investment income growth. In addition, credit quality of the portfolio remains at a AA minus duration increased from 2.4 years to 2.5 years in the first quarter.\nThe effective tax rate increased to 23% in the first quarter, and we expect this to remain elevated throughout 2024 when compared to the prior year. The amount of foreign income and its contribution to the global earnings of the company at tax rates greater than 21% statutory rate in the U.S. will likely result in a higher annual expected effective tax rate. Our stockholders' equity remains very strong at a record $7.8 billion despite an increase in unrealized losses and currency translation losses of $98 million in the quarter. Book value per share was $30.34 at quarter end, an increase of 4.4% from year-end and 14.7% over the prior year quarter.\nWith that, Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thank you. So let me start with a few sort of comments on the marketplace, and then I'll offer a few further observations on our quarter. So perhaps a place to begin would be bifurcating between insurance versus reinsurance, which, obviously, the markets are related, but they're not one and the same. And starting with insurance, maybe calling out E&S as a part of the market. I think there's been some commentary around perhaps E&S is losing some momentum.\nAnd I would suggest that one needs to use at least through my lens, somewhat of a finer brush. As far as we can see the momentum for the liability lines is -- continues to be as strong as ever. To the extent you're seeing any slowing in the momentum E&S, it's likely to be property related. As far as the property market in general, when it comes to insurance, we think that it still does have some momentum, but it probably does not have the level of momentum that it had last year.\nWe're still seeing rates moving up and we expect they will continue to move up for the immediate future. And having been said, I think part of what you're seeing is the insurance marketplace catching up to what the reinsurance marketplace had taking action around and their cost of the capacity they rent has gone up. As far as GL, again, from our perspective, it remains very robust, both admitted and non-admitted. And no surprise, it's the social inflation continuing to persist that is driving that is driving that.\nOn the topic of social inflation, auto, which as I think I've commented on in the past, continues to be very much in the crosshairs of social inflation. We think that, that is part of the market that you're going to see considerable additional firming going on, specifically in commercial auto. Access and umbrella, particularly to the extent that it relates to the commercial auto market, you're going to see additional firm in there as well.\n[Audio Gap]\nspoken about our concerns around discipline over the past couple of years within the liability -- the reinsurance liability market, and we'll see what comes of that.\nTurning to our quarter. Top line, just shy of 11%. As you would have noted in the release, we are pleased with the rate increase that we got at the 7.8, which, in our opinion, is comfortably outpacing trend in the aggregate. And the renewal retention ratio continues to be at approximately 80%, which is what we would expect. The strength in the insurance growth, as Rich referenced, just shy of 13% is quite strong. Property, in particular, was a contributor as we take advantage of that market opportunity. And again, in keeping with my comments about market conditions.\nOn the reinsurance front, you would have seen us continuing to exercise discipline when it comes to the casualty or liability lines. As far as our loss ratio goes, clearly, a good performance in the quarter, and we believe that the stage is set for a good balance of the year as well as increasingly what we should be expecting for and beyond. Just as a data point that I share from time to time because I think it's a helpful indicator or certainly a truth that we can all hang our hat on. During the quarter, our paid loss ratio was 45.8, which is the second lowest it's been in the past 8 years, and the only time it was lower, it was lower by 50 basis points. So we are in a very comfortable place on that front.\nJust on the topic of losses, maybe spending a few moments on the topic of loss reserves. And I think there's a shared appreciation for the challenges that stem from just to put a stake in the ground '19 and prior and what that may mean. From our perspective, I think that we are well on our way, as I've suggested to [indiscernible] having that behind us. The average life of our reserves is just inside of 4 years. So at this stage, that period is getting very much towards the end. Is there perhaps a little bit out there still. We'll see what time it's possible. But certainly, our expectation is that much of it has been processed, if you will.\nI think a few other data points that are worth noting, at least we find them to be helpful as leading indicators when it comes to strength of reserves and putting aside the comment about paid losses. We would encourage people to consider having to look at IBNR as a percent of total reserves, the ratio of IBNR to case reserves. And while some people may look at those two data points and say, well, they could be impacted by the growth in the business. And certainly, there would be that reality to a certain extent though I would suggest that people should look more carefully at how much of our growth was coming from rate.\nThat all having been said, there is another data point that we look to and we would encourage others to consider as well. And that is initial IBNR as a percent of net premium earned. I think all of these data points that I am strong to your attention to our worth your consideration. And I think would suggest this -- our reserves are in an improving -- [indiscernible] more likely than not continuing to improve, and we will see that mature over time.\nAs far as the event is go, Rich walked through that. In particular, I would just call out that we had 4 businesses that had been in their infancy in the first quarter of this year is the first time we pulled them into the expense ratio, and we're pleased to see how they are developing and maturing. So on the investment portfolio, Rich had walked you through this as well. But a couple of highlights from my perspective, you referenced the AA minus, and it happens to be a very strong AA-. So there could be a lot of credit activity, and we would still be in a very comfortable place.\nAs Rich flagged the duration it nudged out from 2.4 to 2.5. Do we continue to look for opportunities us it out. Yes, absolutely. Do we feel any pressure that we need to do that overnight? Absolutely not. The book yield as Rich referenced, or maybe he didn't, I'll be referencing now was 5.9%, but [indiscernible] back out the Argentine component, the book yield is actually 4.2%. I think that's relevant because I talk about how we're sort of laying the ground for the future here or what 1 should expect going forward. with our sort of core domestic portfolio, which is the lion's share of what we have at 4.2% and a new money rate that's somewhere between 525 and 550, I think that combined with the strength of our cash flow, should give you a sense as to the earnings power of the business and the contribution that we will be receiving from the investment portfolio again, I think there's considerable upside from here, again, with the domestic fixed income portfolio, that's 100 basis points plus upside from here.\nSo when you put it all together, I think that we have been thoughtful and prudent on the underwriting side. We responded as we -- to the data and push rate and adjusted terms, conditions and appetite, mix of business, and we are seeing the benefits of that, but we don't want to quite frankly, as we've shared with you in the past, declare prematurely and -- but more likely in my opinion than not, but we'll see with time good news to come on that front.\nIn addition to that, as I just suggested as it relates to the other part of our economic model, our investment portfolio, very well positioned, benefiting from the focus and the discipline and the opportunity to take advantage of a new money rate that is 100 basis points above where our book yield of our core portfolio will prove to be very advantageous. So with that, I will pause there and [indiscernible] if you could please open it up for questions."

Berkley Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. The speaker's remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including, without limitation, believes, expects or estimates. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our other filings made with the SEC for a description of the business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results. W.R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nSarah, thank you very much, and good afternoon all, and welcome to our fourth quarter call and for that matter, full year '23 call. In addition to me, you also have Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman on the call; as well as Rich Baio, our Chief Financial Officer of the company.\nWe are going to follow our usual agenda where very shortly, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk us through some highlights from the quarter. Once he completed his comments, I'll offer a couple of thoughts of my own. And then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A.\nBefore I hand it over to Rich, I did just want to offer a thought or two. And for some participants, this probably won't be new to I guess, a discussion that we've had in the past.\nFor our organization, there is without a doubt amongst all of us colleagues, a shared recognition that the goal of the exercise is value creation. We approach this through a lens that we've again touched on in the past, but I'll flag it again, a lens that we refer to as risk-adjusted return. All returns are not created equal. One needs to consider the type of risk that you are taking on in order to achieve that return. And in contemplating that risk, one needs to consider volatility as a component of that. One needs to ask themselves the question, am I getting paid enough for that risk? And of course, and considering that what role volatility plays.\nIn the fourth quarter of '23, there should be many market participants that report good numbers. But I think that one needs to look beyond just a quarter. One need to look at the year. One needs to look at the past several years. When it comes to value creation, it's not just about a step forward. It's about consistently taking steps forward, and it's about avoiding taking steps backwards. When you look at the results of our quarter, without a doubt, they are very strong, very robust by any measure. But I would encourage people to look at the full year and look at the past many years. And our ability to create value, taking into account the risk that we are accepting in order to achieve those returns is really the cornerstone why we've been able to build value for shareholders so successfully over many years this quarter and this year, no exception.\nSo to that end, before I hand it over to Rich, I would like to thank and congratulate my colleagues throughout the organization on a really outstanding quarter, outstanding year and yet another year of a job very well done. Also on behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank our shareholders for allowing us the opportunity and the privilege for managing capital on their behalf. I will pause there. And Rich, over to you. What do you have for us?\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it, and good afternoon, everyone. The company continued to report record-setting financial results in the quarter, leading to an outstanding full year. Net income increased to $397 million or $1.47 per share compared with $382 million or $1.37 per share in the prior year quarter. Annualized return on beginning of year equity was 23.6%. Record operating income increased more than 21% to $392 million or $1.45 per share, with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 23.2%. Our extreme ownership in maximizing risk-adjusted return in everything we do contributed to our record full year underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income. Our top line growth accelerated throughout the year with the fourth quarter, reflecting a 12% increase in net premiums written to more than $2.7 billion, bringing the full year to a record of almost $11 billion.\nOn a constant foreign currency exchange rate basis, the quarterly and full year growth was adversely impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to the weakening U.S. dollar. On a segment basis, insurance grew 12.3% to more than $2.4 billion in the quarter from rate improvement and exposure growth. The reinsurance and Monoline Excess segment increased 10.2% to more than $300 million. This marks a record level for full year gross and net premiums written for each segment.\nTurning to underwriting performance. Record quarterly pretax underwriting income increased 8.2% to $316 million, representing a calendar year combined ratio of 88.4%. Current accident year catastrophe losses were flat at 1.2 loss ratio points for the comparable quarters with $32 million and $30 million reported in fourth quarter 2023 and 2022, respectively. Prior year development was favorable by $1 million, bringing our current accident year loss ratio ex cats to 58.8%. The improvement over the prior year's quarter of 50 basis points was primarily due to business mix and lower attritional property losses. The expense ratio increased 60 basis points to 28.4% in the current quarter, flat to the 2023 full year.\nThe increase from the prior year's quarter is consistent with our prior communication, that being lower ceding commissions resulting from business mix and reinsurance structure changes over the past year. In addition, increased compensation costs and start-up operating unit expenses have also contributed to the small increase. We expect that our 2024 full year expense ratio should be comfortably below 30% and taking into consideration investments in such things like technology and data and analytics as well as new start-up operating unit expenses. So in summary, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes for the quarter was 87.2%.\nRecord quarterly pretax net investment income increased more than 35% to $313 million bringing the full year to more than $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. The combination of our short duration and record level operating cash flow of more than $2.9 billion in the full year has positioned us well to invest in securities with higher interest rates. The book yield on the fixed maturity portfolio continued to advance throughout the year to 4.4% on a 12-month basis. Our net invested assets increased approximately 10% in the past year to almost $27 billion. The credit quality of the portfolio remains very strong at AA- with the duration on our fixed maturity portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents of 2.4 years.\nThe investment funds improved from the consecutive quarter to $11 million, although declined from the prior year, in large part due to market value adjustments in the real estate fund area. As a reminder, the investment funds are generally reported on a 1-quarter lag. Foreign currency losses in the quarter related to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to most other currencies. It's worth noting, however, that the net effect to stockholders' equity is negligible since the improvement in our currency translation adjustment more than offset the amount reflected in the income statement. Stockholders' equity increased to a record of almost $7.5 billion.\nCareful capital management throughout the year resulted in three special dividends of $0.50 each per share plus regular quarterly dividends totaling $501 million. In addition, share repurchases in the quarter of almost 1.6 million shares contributed to a total of more than 8.7 million shares repurchased during the year amounting to $537 million or $61.69 per share. So our capital management during 2023 aggregated to more than $1 billion. The most we've returned to shareholders in 1 year while growing shareholders' equity more than 10% and maintaining more than adequate capital to support ongoing growth in the business. Book value per share increased 11.6% and and 25.5% in the quarter and full year before dividends and share repurchases. And Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thank you very much. Pretty attractive picture and even a conservative CPA couldn't make it sound anything other than encouraging. So a couple of observations on my end. Obviously, the top line growth, we're pleased with the progress that we're making relative to the past few quarters. I think this is unfolding exactly as we suggested. Just calling out a few pieces of that puzzle. Clearly, some of the things that we had talked about as far as portfolios that we were separating from much of that pig is through the python. The specialty market in general continues to be particularly attractive. I would highlight E&S, especially. Furthermore, I don't think that party is over. When we are looking at the submission flow, we continue to be quite encouraged.\nOn the other hand, certainly, within the professional liability space, and I'll call out public D&O as perhaps one of the extreme examples, I think it is delicate and treacherous and as you can see in the numbers in our release, we are treading thoughtfully as you'd expect.\nRich touched on the rate coming in at 8%, which based on our assessment, it's pretty clear that we are comfortably exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss cost trend and we are encouraged by that. I know that there are a couple of chicken little out there that are sort of hanging on the rate number that we share on a quarterly basis and some might say, well, geez, this is down below where it was in the third quarter. And that is a factually correct statement. That having been said, I would caution people to please understand that is really driven by mix of business and not just product line, but we have more than 60 different businesses under the group umbrella and at any moment in time, some are growing more than others and rate opportunity is not equal amongst all the businesses in the group and obviously, all product lines as well. And just as a point of reference, you'll recall this time or fourth quarter '22, we got 6.9 points of rate comp. So again, we are comfortably above where we were a year ago, and we are confident, again, that we are exceeding trend by a meaningful margin.\nAgain, Rich talked about the losses. I'm not going to get into that. The only thing that I will flag is that the paid loss ratio for the quarter came in at 48 and change. And for -- I don't know how many quarters it is at this stage. It's just sort of floating between 46 and 49, which I think is really just a reflection of the rate action along with the underwriting discipline and focus of our colleagues that are allowing us to be arguably writing business at a pretty healthy margin to say the least.\nAgain, Rich touched on the expense piece. So I'm not going to rehash that other than I will make the one comment that for purposes of '24, we have some businesses that we started prior and those are going to be impacting our expense ratio. Though even with those coming into the expense ratio as they are in business for a full year. The fact of the matter is that's going to be a relatively modest drag going the other way as far as benefit goes. You can see what happened with our written premium in Q3 and certainly in Q4, and we all know how that's going to trickle through and impact the earned in '24, which will clearly be a positive.\nLast comment on the investment portfolio. Rich touched on that as far as the book yield. As far as we're concerned, the new money rate for us still today, even with all the humming and hung about where interest rates are going, we still can put money to work at 5-plus percent. So we think that there's opportunity there. As Rich mentioned, the duration 2.4 years, we are looking for the window of opportunity to nudge that out. We are not in a rush. We have a slightly different view than much of the world as to where interest rates are going. And when the window of opportunity presents itself, you will likely see that 2.4 moving out from here.\nSo again, I think it's exciting that we had a good quarter. It's rewarding and encouraging that we had a good year and top of a good year in '22 and so on. But I think the most encouraging thing is when you look at where -- or I should say, how the table is set for '24 and beyond, we are in a very good place. and not only on the underwriting side, but on the investment side. So I believe in '24 and likely beyond, you are going to continue to see this economic model firing on all cylinders. So that probably wasn't as brief as I promised, but it was relatively brief for me. And I'm going to pause there. And Sarah, we would be very pleased to open it up for questions. Thank you."

W. R.

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nLisa, thank you very much, and good afternoon all. And I guess a second welcome to our Q3 call. We appreciate you dialing in and your time and your interest today. Joining me on the call at least on this end is Bill Berkley, Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. He's going to give us a bit of an overview and flag some highlights from the quarter. I will follow with a few comments of my own and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A.\nBefore I do hand it to Rich, I just wanted to make a couple of quick observations and really one macro one in particular, and that is on the results of the quarter. I think by any measure, call it, a 20% return is really an outstanding result. The fact is there were no onetime list or onetime not in there. That is truly when you strip it down to its fundamentals, that is how the business is performing. And these great results are really a reflection of a team. This is a team sport, not an individual sport. So my congratulations to all of our colleagues throughout the organization on a job very well done. I have the good fortune of being their mouthpiece in these types of settings. But again, this achievement was a team achievement.\nTo that end, obviously, it was a quarter where the organization was able to demonstrate, excuse me, our value proposition to capital. The idea of less risk for more return. We've talked to you all in the past about how we are preoccupied with the concept that we refer to as risk-adjusted return. You can see it in moments like these that we just saw in Q3 very clearly. When as our Chairman says, the tide goes out, you get to see who's where and what. You could see it in both aspects of our business activities, one being underwriting, the other one being investing. Our underwriting results of a combined of 90 during a period that had meaningful cat activity is really exceptional.\nAdditionally, on the investing activity, clearly, a book yield of 4.5%, while maintaining a quality of AA- and additionally, a new money rate of approximately 6%. That is no accident either. These results, these achievements are a result of our colleagues their focus, their discipline and their expertise. This call certainly is about reviewing what happened in the third quarter, but I would suggest even more than that, it is about how the table is set, not just for the coming quarters, but the next several years. So I think we are very well positioned. I think there is a fair amount of visibility. We will be getting into that in a bit more detail later in the call.\nBut at this moment, let me hand it over to Rich, and he's going to walk us through some numbers. Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOf course. Thanks, Rob, appreciate it. Net income increased 45.7% to $334 million or $1.23 per share with a return on equity of 19.8%. Operating income increased 30.1% to $367 million or $1.35 per share, with an operating return on equity of 21.7%. The company's strong performance was driven by another quarter of significant underwriting profits bringing the 9 months year-to-date to a record despite consecutive quarters of outsized industry-wide catastrophe losses. In addition, net investment income accelerated throughout the year to yet another quarterly record. Drilling further into the underwriting results, net premiums written grew 10.5% to a record of more than $2.8 billion. We significantly grew the insurance business by approximately 17.5% in other liability, short tail lines and commercial automobile through rate and exposure.\nDecreases in workers' compensation and certain professional lines certainly tempered the growth in net premiums written, bringing the overall insurance segment growth to 12.1%. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment was flat quarter-over-quarter with continued growth in Monoline Excess and property reinsurance. Pretax underwriting income was $259 million with the calendar year combined ratio of 90.2%. The current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 87.9%. Current accident year catastrophe losses in the quarter were $62 million or 2.3 loss ratio points compared with $94 million in the prior year quarter or 3.9 loss ratio points.\nThe prior year favorable development was approximately $1 million, and the current accident year loss ratio ex cats was 59.6%. The expense ratio increased 0.3 points to 28.3% from the prior year and remains in line with our 9 months year-to-date. The small increase is attributable to the same items we've communicated during the past couple of quarters, that being the change in outward reinsurance structures impacting ceding commissions and increased compensation costs along with start-up operating unit expenses. We also continue to invest in technology and areas to drive operational efficiencies. Record quarterly net investment income of $271 million grew by 33.6%, with the core investment portfolio increasing by 59.3%. There are two main drivers for the significant increase in the core portfolio, including the rising interest rate environment, benefiting the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities as they mature or are redeemed.\nAnd second, the increase in the size of the portfolio due to continuous record levels of operating cash flows. In the third quarter, we reported another record level of operating cash flow of almost $1.1 billion. To put some context around this point, the book yield has grown from 3.8% in the first quarter of 2023 to 4.2% in the second quarter to 4.5% in the current quarter on fixed maturity securities. The current 9-month year-to-date book yield of 4.2% compares to 2.6% for the prior year period. It's also worth noting that almost 81% of of our net invested assets are in fixed maturity securities, cash and cash equivalents. The credit quality of the fixed maturity securities remained strong at AA- and the duration's ticked up to 2.4 years from the consecutive quarter of 2.3 years.\nPartially offsetting the increase in the core portfolio is net investment income from investment funds. You may recall this asset class is generally reported on a 1-quarter lag and will more closely correlate with the broader equity markets. Accordingly, reported net investment income from investment funds was approximately $4 million representing a marginal improvement from the first half of 2023. We continue to proactively manage our capital position, as you saw our announcement of the $0.50 special dividend per share late in the third quarter in addition to our regular quarterly dividend. This brings total capital return to investors on a year-to-date basis to approximately $775 million, with stockholders' equity increasing to more than $6.9 billion. Book value per share before dividends and share repurchases on a year-to-date basis has increased 13.7%, excuse me.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thanks very much. That was great. So I'm just going to offer a couple of other quick observations on the quarter and how we see things unfolding from here. And then again, we'll move on to the Q&A. Rich touched on the top line. Obviously, building momentum, again, as promised, just as a reminder to some number of quarters ago, we agreed to disagree with a couple of partners as to what we thought was an adequate rate. They did not think that we needed that much rate. And again, we decided to part ways that had a meaningful impact to the negative on our top line.\nThat takes making its way through the python to the extent that it's of interest that was in the auto line. So we wish them well and we'll see how that unfolds. Speaking of different products, obviously, the marketplace for the past 12, 18, 24 months or so has been very focused on property and with good reason. I would suggest to you, as we've commented in past quarters, Auto liability is one that people need to continue to pay close attention to. I think as far as product lines, when it comes to social inflation, auto liability has the biggest bull's eye on its chest and by extension, that clearly spills over to excess and as well as umbrella.\nThat having been said, just in general, social inflation continues to burn, and we do not see that abating anytime soon. Quick comment on workers' comp. I know we've touched on this in the past. We continue to be of the view that one needs to be very mindful of medical cost trend. We went through a period of time where it was pretty benign. We think that is shifting very quickly. We've touched on it in the past. We think it's going to become more and more into focus for a broader audience over the coming quarters. In addition to that, the benefit that comp was getting both as it relates to COVID and frequency. And then on the heels of COVID, a tight labor market and wage inflation, I think those benefits have run their course and clearly, wage inflation is slowing.\nI mentioned a moment ago, the topic of social inflation. We are very focused on it. You can see it in our rate increases, ex-comp coming in at 8.5%. We have every intention of continuing to stay on top of it. We think the market is accepting our rate increases and you can see that, in part, demonstrated by our renewal retention ratio continues to be at approximately a steady 80%. Another number that I find useful perhaps others do as well, is the paid loss ratio. This is a number that we flagged for you all in the past. Again, coming in at a very healthy 47.9% for the quarter, which obviously, given where we are booking the business, would lead one to believe that the strength of our IBNR speaks for itself and would encourage people to look at our IBNR relative to case and IBNR relative to total reserves to the extent you're interested in the topic.\nAs far as the investment portfolio goes, again, Rich, went into some detail on this. I touched on it earlier. But without a doubt, it's not just about the 4.5% that we're getting on the book yield. I think the bigger story is the new money rate today, give or take, 6%. You compound that with the strength of the cash flow that the business is experiencing, I think it's, again, setting a table for a very encouraging future. The duration we did bump out from 2.3% to 2.4%, I think it's more likely than not over time, you're going to continue to see that push out. But the fact is having kept it short the way we have has given us greater flexibility to take advantage of the higher rates in a more immediate or over a shorter period of time.\nYes. Finally, and perhaps a little bit on the forward-looking and picking up on the comments about the investment portfolio. Nobody knows with certainty what tomorrow will bring and there certainly is the potential for volatility to be around the corner. That having been said, you can see the business' ability to weather a choppy time as far as cat activity. You can see the rate increases that we are getting. And you can see how, quite frankly, I should say, we can see where the book yield is going.\nSo that all having been said, I think it's very clear where the -- how the business is positioned for the coming quarters and the coming years and the earnings power of the business is likely to be accelerating from here Lisa, I'm going to pause there, and why don't we go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

Berkley Corporation's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. The speakers' remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including, without limitation, beliefs, expects or estimates. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved.\nPlease refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our other filings made with the SEC for a description of the business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results. W. R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of the new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\n[ Brianna ], thank you very much, and good afternoon all. And again, welcome to our second quarter call. Along with me on this end of the phone, we also have our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkley, as well as Chief Financial Officer, Rich Baio. And we're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'm going to hand it over to Rich, who will walk us through some highlights from the quarter. I will follow up with a few observations after Rich makes his comments. And then we will be opening it up for Q&A. .\nBefore I hand it over to Rich, a few comments from me. Based on everything, I can see [ it ] look as though the stage is being set for what one might call yet another but-for quarter for the industry. It would seem as though cat losses don't make a difference. And bizarrely, from our perspective, people seem very quick to back out cat losses as though it's not real money. But ironically, they don't seem to back out the premium associated with the exposure that just had the losses.\nSo again, from our perspective, it's no wonder why the industry struggles oftentimes to make good risk-adjusted returns. In order to do that, one needs to recognize the exposure taking on and not pretend that it doesn't exist, particularly when it occurs.\nThrough our lens, we are in the capital management business. We are focused on risk-adjusted returns and around here, cat losses count. In our opinion, it is not monopoly money. It is real money. And when we measure how we are doing, we do not back out cat losses. Perhaps we are a bit of an exception to the industry, but ultimately, we think it is an economic reality, and that's not something we shy away from. So with that, Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOf course. Thanks, Rob. Net income doubled from the prior year quarter, resulting in $356 million or $1.30 per share. Annualized return on beginning of your equity was 21.1% driven by strong underwriting and record investment income results. Operating return on equity was excellent at 18.4% and the heightened industry-wide catastrophe activity in the quarter enabled us to once again demonstrate our underwriting discipline in challenging environments. Simultaneously, our decision to maintain a short duration, high credit quality investment portfolio has enabled us to benefit from higher interest rates. .\nNet investment income increased almost 43% to a record $245 million. The core investment portfolio grew 71.6% driven by a higher book yield at 4.2% in the quarter compared with the preceding consecutive quarter of 3.8% and second quarter of 2022 of 2.6%. Second quarter operating cash flows of $709 million, combined with the first quarter brings us to a first half year record of almost $1.2 billion and strengthens our ability to grow investable assets at higher interest rates. A duration of 2.3 years also positions us well to reinvest assets at a higher new money rate on fixed maturity securities compared to the roll-off of existing investments while maintaining our high credit quality of AA-.\nThe investment funds reflected a loss of $1 million, driven by a decline in market values in certain funds in the consumer goods, real estate and financial services sectors. Please keep in mind that we report our investment funds on a 1-quarter lag. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $59 million is comprised of net realized gains on investments of $47 million and an improvement in unrealized gains on equity securities of $21 million, partially offset by an increase in current expected credit losses of $10 million.\nTurning to underwriting results. underwriting income was $265 million, representing a calendar year combined ratio of 89.6%. Current accident year catastrophe losses were $54 million or 2.1 loss ratio points compared with the prior year of $58 million or 2.5 loss ratio points. Prior year development was favorable by $3 million or 0.1 loss ratio points bringing our current accident year combined ratio ex cats to 87.6%. Current accident year loss ratio ex cats was 59.5%. The expense ratio ticked up 0.4 points to 28.1% in the quarter, consistent with the expectations we previously communicated.\nThe 2 main contributors include the change in reinsurance structures as well as increased compensation costs and start-up operating unit expenses. We're working hard to identify and implement innovative strategies to drive operating efficiencies and leverage technology in order to reduce operating expenses across the entire organization.\nClosing out the underwriting discussion with premium production. We increased gross premiums written by 9.3% to a record $3.3 billion and net premiums written increased 8.7% to a record $2.8 billion. All lines of business grew in the Insurance segment with the exception of professional liability and workers' compensation while property reinsurance grew in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment.\nStockholders' equity remained strong at almost $6.9 billion after returning more than $320 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. We repurchased almost 5.1 million shares for $292.5 million at an average price per share in the quarter of $57.79. In addition, we paid regular dividends of $28.3 million. The combination of these capital-related actions for the first quarter including the special dividend translates to $614.5 million returned to investors on a year-to-date basis or 9.1% of the beginning of year stockholders' equity. Rob, I'll turn it back to you. Thanks.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thank you very much. Very helpful. So Look, I think the market continues to not operate in any type of lockstep where major lines, as we've discussed in the past continue to somewhat march to the beat of their own drum. In addition to that, we continue to see the marketplace struggling with trying to strike the balance between rate need and keeping up with loss cost trend. On the other hand, a desire to grow. .\nThis is an industry where you can, practically speaking, grow as quickly as you want to. It really becomes a much more challenging exercise though when you were looking to achieve a certain loss ratio, which will deliver a return that is acceptable in the end. For us, rate adequacy to support a reasonable loss ratio and deliver an acceptable return has, is and will remain a priority for us. I believe that this has been demonstrated over time through our results and obviously, our continued focus on making sure that we are keeping up with trend comfortably.\nA couple of soundbites on the marketplace and major product lines. And I would hope it will dovetail in with some of Rich's comments and where we have been growing and parts of the marketplace that we find less attractive and we're playing a bit more defense. For starters, speaking of defense, I think public D&O within the professional line space is clearly a place that one needs to pause and tread carefully. We are seeing the pricing erode at a very rapid pace. Clearly, there has been good margin in the business, but that seems to be whittling away quite quickly.\nAs far as liability lines and maybe under the umbrella of social inflation, we continue particularly in the auto space, especially commercial auto, to see great challenge. That's also spilling over into GL and ultimately, umbrella. And what I mean by that is the plaintiff bar is very aggressive, and they are taking a variety of new tactics. We think that we are able to keep up with it appropriately through terms, conditions, attachment points, and of course, pricing but it is not lost on us that it is a challenging moment and requires one pay close attention.\nIn addition to that, there is growing evidence that the tail associated with some of these product lines maybe extending a little bit, particularly on the claims -- excuse me, on the occurrence front and to a certain extent on certain aspects of the claims made front.\nProperty, I think it has finally come into focus what needed to happen as it relates to cat-exposed properties and that seems to be spilling over into the non-cat or risk property account where additional rate is required. The other piece that's worth mentioning, at least through, in my opinion, is tier 2 cat, which I would define as severe convective storm, wildfire winter storm, et cetera. These are things that were a bit of an afterthought. And I think after the past several years, they are becoming much more front of mind.\nLast comment as it relates to market conditions would be workers' compensation, certainly a topic we have discussed on these calls in the past. There was a period of time during COVID, where clearly, there was a break that was caught on the frequency front for the industry. Frequency has returned to a more traditional norm, but one of the things that we've been waiting for, and we're starting to finally see rear its head is medical inflation. It is our expectation that you are going to see more medical inflation coming through to all payers, including the workers' comp space.\nAnd as a reminder, slightly over 50% of every claims dollar associated with workers' compensation stems from medical. So again, we can get into more details on that to the extent people are interested later on.\nLast comment on the marketplace. There continues to be this bifurcation between where the standard market, particularly national [ carriers ] have an appetite. They seem to be very aggressive. But where they don't have an appetite, that is creating great opportunity for the specialty, in particular, the E&S space. The submission flow that we continue to see remains robust, and we are very encouraged with what the balance of the year likely holds and beyond. And certainly, the early returns on July are positive.\nRich talked about the top line. Obviously, we benefited from the rate increases that we continue to get, the ex comp rate increase during the quarter was 8.2%, which was reasonably consistent with what we saw earlier this year. I think the loss ratio demonstrates yet again, our strategy around how we manage exposure, how we have balance in the portfolio and how we think about risk and return and certainly volatility is folded into that and, in our opinion, is a key component in building book value.\nAs far as the expenses go, Rich touched on that as well. We remain very focused on making sure we're thoughtful about the dollars that we spend, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that number won't remain comfortably below 30.\nAnd pivoting over to the investment portfolio, we remain -- we continue, I should say, excuse me, to be rewarded for the position that we took as it relates to duration. Obviously, as we've discussed in the past, we benefited in having less of an adverse impact on our book value as rates moved up. And in addition to that, we were able to put money to work at higher rates more quickly than many of our peers.\nThe new money rate in the quarter was probably around 5.25 plus and as you would gather relative to the book yield at 4.2%, that would suggest we still have significant upside, and that will come into focus over some period of time. Rich mentioned the duration at 2.3, I think it was at 2.4 last quarter. Just to clarify that, that was really as much as anything, just rounding. That having been said, we are paying close attention, as you would expect, for the window of opportunity and when it presents itself, likely you'll see that duration start to push out again.\nSo all things being equal, I think a very solid quarter for us on virtually every front. I think when you take into account the cat activity that the industry faced, we fared particularly well. And in spite of that, our ability to generate a 21% return, I think, is really a great positive and a tribute to our colleagues and to our strategy and how effectively they are executing.\nWhen the day is all done, the goal of the exercise is to build book value. There is no question that is the goal. Ultimately, it's when building book value, it is not just about the steps you take forward. It is also about the steps take -- that you avoid taking backwards.\nSo with that, [ Brianna ], we'd be very pleased to open it up for questions. Thank you."

Thank you for finding time to join us this afternoon. Cohosting with me today is Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman; as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run through some of the financial highlights from the quarter. Once he gets through his comments, he'll be handling -- handing it back to me. I will follow up with a few of my own observations, and then the 3 of us will be available for Q&A to answer any questions people may have.\nSo with that, Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it. The company is off to a strong start with the first quarter of 2023 despite the significant catastrophe losses facing the industry. Our scale, specialization and disciplined management approach positioned us well to report an annualized return on equity of 17.4%. Contributions to this performance was reflected in both underwriting and investment income. The current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was a strong 87.7%. And investment income approached the record level achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by significant growth in our core portfolio investment income of more than 80%.\nThe balance sheet also strengthened with stockholders' equity growing to a record level of more than $6.9 billion and book value per share increasing 3.7% in the quarter. The company returned almost $300 million of capital to shareholders through regular and special dividends as well as share repurchases, resulting in growth in book value per share before dividends and repurchases of 7.2%. The short duration in the fixed maturity investment portfolio of 2.4 years and high credit quality of AA- benefited unrealized investment losses by approximately $181 million.\nContinuing on investment performance. Net investment income increased almost 29% to $223 million. The income attributable to the core portfolio substantially increased due to a higher new money rate on fixed maturity securities compared to the roll-off of existing investments. In addition, strong operating cash flow of approximately $445 million in the quarter increased our investable assets and will further contribute to growth in net investment income. The book yield has increased from 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 3.8% in the current quarter on fixed maturity securities.\nThe investment funds reflected income of $2 million for the quarter, primarily arising from declines in market value in the financial services and consumer goods sectors, partially offset by income from transportation and energy funds. Pretax net investment gains reflected an increase of $43 million in unrealized gains on equity securities, bringing our total unrealized gains to approximately $114 million on the balance sheet. Equity investments in the technology sector drove the quarterly improvement. Partially offsetting these unrealized equity gains were losses recognized of approximately $21 million.\nTurning to underwriting results. Underwriting income was $234 million, which included current accident year catastrophe losses of $48 million or 1.9 loss ratio points and prior accident year unfavorable development of $24 million or 1 loss ratio point principally from property catastrophe losses. Winter storms impacted both the current quarter and carried over from late loss activity in the fourth quarter of last year. This compares with catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2022 in the amount of $29 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. The calendar year loss ratio for first quarter of 2023 was 61.8%, and the current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 58.9%.\nThe growth in net premiums earned of almost 11% continues to benefit the expense ratio. However, a number of factors are causing the expense ratio to increase 0.5 point to 28.8%. First, the change in our reinsurance over the last year has lowered our ceding commissions on certain treaties where we've moved from proportional covers to excess of loss and/or reduced our quota share percent ceded to reinsurance partners. In addition, increased compensation costs and new start-up operating unit expenses are contributing to the higher expense ratio. We still expect our expense ratio to be comfortably below 30% as communicated on our fourth quarter call.\nWrapping up with premium production, net premiums written grew by almost 7% to approximately $2.6 billion. The Insurance segment grew 6.6% to $2.2 billion. And as you saw in the supplemental information on Page 7 of the earnings release, all lines of business improved with the exception of professional liability. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 7.1% to $363 million, a record level for the segment with growth in all lines of business.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thanks very much. That was great. So let me provide a couple of observations through my lens, and then, again, as promised, we'll open it up for Q&A.\nSo upon reflection, certainly, one of the things that we chat quite a bit about on our end of the phone is just taking note of how clearly the cycle remains alive and well, and the emotions that drive the behaviors remain very much intact. But we continue to take note of the fact how major product lines, while they are still subject to the cyclical behavior, the fact of the matter is, they are clearly not in lockstep at all. And we've talked about this in the past, but it seems to be coming more and more pronounced. So to that end, just a snapshot on how we're thinking about property clearly in what I would suggest is early stages of meaningful firming.\nFrom our perspective, it is a little bit disappointing as to the momentum that we saw on the Insurance side when it comes to property in January. We saw a little bit more momentum in February. And quite frankly, March, we started to see real progress. And April, I think there was meaningful traction as far as rate goes. While it perhaps is a little bit more announced or extreme on the cat side, I would tell you these comments apply to non-cat or risk exposure as well.\nProfessional liability, on the other hand, clearly, it's a very broad category, and it is a mixed bag. I think on the miscellaneous E&O front, particularly written on an E&S basis, there is still great opportunity, and we are making meaningful hay there. On the other hand, the D&O marketplace, particularly large account D&O, I would tell you for some number of quarters, and it continues to be in a state of free fall as far as rate adequacy or pricing, if you will, and it is concerning to us. In addition to that, though a smaller line than D&O, I would tell you hospital professional liability is another product line where it's in desperate need of some discipline returning to the marketplace.\nMoving away from professional onto the topic of casualty. I would tell you that it seems, from our perspective, there is also a meaningful opportunity there, particularly in the E&S lines on the primary front. On the excess front, particularly large accounts becoming more challenging. Clearly, a similar situation on the auto classes as well, where excess is becoming a bit more competitive, and the primary there is competition but not as bad.\nI think the industry needs to be very careful with the professional casualty and auto, in particular, because they are notably susceptible to social inflation. And from our perspective, while there are signs that economic inflation is cooling a little bit from the heights that it reached social inflation, there's really no sign or indication that we see that calming at all.\nMoving on to comp. Clearly, it continues to bounce along the bottom. One observation there historically or at least often times, California has lagged the rest of the market as far as where it stood in the cycle. There is some evidence that California is actually ahead of the rest of the market, is showing potential signs of firming.\nFinally, reinsurance. I think there was a lot of excitement and discussion around affirming reinsurance market. Certainly, from our perspective, the reinsurance market, particularly around property and property cat, has gained a meaningful level of additional discipline relative to where it's been in past years. That having been said, the casualty, somewhat disciplined, and there are certain parts of the professional marketplace that have given us reason to pause as we were just not seeing the ceding commissions coming down even though we are seeing the pricing of the underlying erode.\nPivoting over to us. A couple of sound bites. I think as Rich suggested, 17.4% return, a great way to start the year. In our opinion, the top line was impacted by what I would refer to as strong or excellent cycle management by our colleagues, as we are deemphasizing certain product lines and leaning into other product lines. Just as a reminder, our priority is the bottom line. We are focused on building book value through a lens that we refer to as risk-adjusted return, and we applaud the discipline and opportunistic approach that our colleagues operate with.\nOn the topic of rate, as we were touching earlier, clearly, the rate was quite strong in the quarter, which we were pleased to see. The 8.3x comp is the strongest that we've seen on the rate front since this time last year or the same time last year. Additionally, I would mention that the renewal retention ratio still is hanging in there around 80%, which as we've mentioned in the past, we think it's an important data point because it reminds us that we are not churning the book, but it actually -- the rate we are getting is sticking. We are not changing the quality or integrity of the book. Important thing again. I guess finally, just on the 8.3, I think by any measure, we are comfortably outpacing trend. And I think it is likely that you will see that coming through in our loss ratios over time.\nEven with the cat activity, the 90.6% combined, I think, is quite attractive. If you're a but-for, which I am not, it would have been an 87.7%. Obviously, the difference, as Rich alluded to, and you would have picked up in the release, was 2 things: one, obviously, the cats that we had during the period, which equated to approximately 1.9 points; and then we had 1 point of negative development. Now before anyone gets too carried away with the negative development, it was essentially driven by property and property cat losses that happened during the fourth quarter. And as people will recall, some of that cat activity happened late in the fourth quarter, and we just didn't have our arms fully around it. So please don't misconstrue the development for being something different than it really is.\nPaid loss ratio, 48 and change. I think people will presumably continue to take note of the delta between the paid versus what we are booking the loss ratio to. We get questions from time to time given how well the paid loss ratio has been running relative to what we -- the loss ratio picks that we are carrying, when are those going to converge? And I would tell you that it's coming.\nIn my opinion, I think there's a reality for the industry, and we are not completely insulated from it. '16 through '19 was a challenging period of time. I think that we have been cautious and measured as to how quickly we want to recognize the progress that was made '20 and more recent than that. But I think that's coming. I think it's going to come more into focus as we make our way through this year into next year. And likely, we'll have implications for the loss picks that we are carrying in the more recent years and also how we think about current year loss picks.\nRich touched on the expense ratio, the 28.8%. As he suggested, partly driven by new business initiatives, partly driven by some investments that we are making, particularly on the technology front. And finally, some shifts that we are making on the reinsurance, as he alluded to, the cede on something proportional or a quota share, obviously, is very different than an XOL. And while we are very keen for our reinsurance partners to make a reasonable return, we are unaccepting of being inappropriately gouged, and we will use our flexibility as appropriate.\nPivoting over to the investment portfolio. Without a doubt, a lot of momentum there. I think we've discussed it in some detail in the past. You can kind of see it coming our way. I think there is more opportunity from here, the duration at the 2.4 years. I think we are looking opportunistically to nudge that out. I don't think we're going to move the needle dramatically overnight, but certainly, our hope is that there will be windows of opportunity to nudge that out a little bit. The book yield at the 3.8% is notably below where the new money rate is. So our best guesstimate that a new money rate today is sort of between 4.25%, 4.5%, so you can do the math as to the upside there.\nRich touched on the funds. We had a little bit of noise in the quarter, not a complete surprise. By and large, it was stemming from some private equity funds that we participate in. We feel like we have clarity around it. And it is our expectation that going forward, funds performance, more likely than not, will return to sort of that range of between $20 million and $50 million a quarter.\nSo long story short, 17.4% return, combined ratio of a 90.6%, with some cat activity both in the quarter and a bit spilling over from Q4 '22. Rate increases robust [ is ] effort. And of course, the new money rate, 50 basis points plus upside relative to the book yield, I think all those things put together are very encouraging. To the extent you're a but-for person, which I am not, again, 87.7% would deliver you a 20-plus percent return.\nSo I think that was more than enough for me. Why don't we, Emma, go ahead and open it up for Q&A, please?"

Berkley Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. The speakers' remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including without limitation, believes, expects or estimates. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved.\nPlease refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our other filings made with the SEC for a description of the business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results. W.R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Mr. Berkley, please go ahead.\n\nW. Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nBo, thank you very much, and good afternoon, all, and a warm welcome to our fourth quarter call. On this end of the phone, cohosting with me is Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman; as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow the typical agenda as we have done it in the past, and I'm going to hand it over to Rich momentarily. He's going to walk us all through some highlights of both the quarter and the year. Once he's through his comments, I'll pick it up from there, offer a few observations and thoughts of my own. And then we will be looking forward to opening up for Q&A and taking the discussion anywhere participants would like it to go.\nOne thing before I hand it over to Rich, and that is just maybe taking a moment to pause and reflect publicly on the year. And we'll be getting into the numbers and the results. But it does seem appropriate, at least from my perspective and our Chairman's perspective, to extend some recognition, thank you and congratulations to our colleagues. I have the good fortune of being the mouthpiece or the one that has the opportunity to talk about the results along with Rich and Bill Berkley.\nBut these results, these outcomes were achieved because we have thousands of people that are working diligently every day in a thoughtful and methodical manner. So to all my colleagues that happen to be tuning in, I hope you will accept the heartfelt thank you again. And congratulations on a good job, very well done. With that, Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOf course, and thanks, Rob. Appreciate it. 2022 can be marked as a record year in many areas of the business. The company ended the year with a strong fourth quarter. Net income increased almost 30% to $382 million or $1.37 per share, with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 23%. Operating income increased approximately 14% to $323 million or $1.16 per share, with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 19.4%.\nOur results reflected record underwriting income as well as net investment income. Severe named cat activity continued to challenge the industry as evidenced this quarter by Winter Storm Elliot and prior quarter events like Hurricane Ian amongst many others. Our disciplined underwriting approach and exposure management led to record pretax quarterly underwriting income of $292 million, representing an increase of approximately 12% over the prior year.\nOn a full year basis, underwriting income eclipsed the prior year by 21.3%, reaching more than $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. Pretax cat losses were $31 million or 1.2 loss ratio points in the quarter compared with $48 million or 2.2 loss ratio points a year ago. Net premiums written increased to more than $2.4 billion. The growth in the top line was adversely impacted by approximately 75 basis points due to the weakening U.S. dollar relative to many foreign currencies.\nOn a segment basis, insurance grew 7.2% in the quarter to more than $2.1 billion from rate improvement and exposure growth. All lines of business increased with the exception of professional liability. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased to $281 million in the quarter with growth in all lines of business. On a full year basis, gross and net premiums written grew to record levels of $11.9 billion and $10 billion, respectively.\nThe current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was impacted in the quarter by nonweather-related property losses, which drove the increase of approximately 1 loss ratio point to 59.3%. Prior year losses developed favorably by approximately $0.3 million, resulting in a calendar year loss ratio of 60.6%. The expense ratio was flat at 27.8% quarter-over-quarter. Record quarterly net premiums earned grew more than 14% in the quarter, continuing to benefit the expense ratio.\nWe do anticipate that our 2023 full year expense ratio should be comfortably below 30%, taking into consideration investments in technology, rising compensation costs and new start-up operating unit expenses. In summary, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes for the quarter was 87.2%, and our calendar year combined ratio was 88.4%.\nNet investment income for the quarter increased more than 40% to a record of approximately $231 million, led by income in the core portfolio, which increased approximately 75%. The combination of our short duration, high-quality fixed maturity portfolio, along with record level operating cash flow of approximately $2.6 billion in the full year, enabled us to invest at higher interest rates. Our book yield on the fixed maturity portfolio increased from 3% for the third quarter to 3.6% for the fourth quarter, which compares very favorably to 2.2% in the year-ago quarter.\nOur new money rate exceeds the roll-off of our invested assets, and we expect net investment income to continue to grow. The investment funds performed well with a book yield of 5.6% despite the deterioration in the broader equity markets in the third quarter. And as you may remember, we report investment funds under 1-quarter lag. The credit quality of the portfolio remains very strong at a AA- with the duration on our fixed maturity portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents of 2.4 years.\nPretax net investment gains in the quarter of $75 million is primarily attributable to an improvement in unrealized gains on equity securities of $88 million relating to investments in the industrial, energy and financial services sectors. The company actively manages its foreign currency exposure. The U.S. dollar weakened in the quarter relative to many foreign currencies, which resulted in a pretax foreign currency loss of $34 million.\nFor the most part, this loss was offset by an increase in our currency translation adjustment, a component of stockholders' equity. And accordingly, the result was an immaterial net impact on book value. Stockholders' equity increased more than $400 million in the quarter or 6.3% to $6.7 billion. The unrealized loss position on fixed maturity securities improved in the quarter. Book value per share increased 8.1% and 6.1% in the quarter and full year before dividends and share repurchases. In addition, book value per share increased 1.7% on a full year basis after returning capital to shareholders of $329 million and our full year return on beginning of year equity was 20.8%.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Rob.\n\nW. Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thank you very much. That was great. So I have a little bit of a list here of topics that I made notes to myself on because I think there's a lot going on in the marketplace, a lot of moving pieces. And obviously, we, as a market participant, are navigating through that.\nSo maybe a place to start would be a macro observation. And I know we've touched on this in the past, but I think it's very important to keep top of mind. It's certainly something that we are, as an organization, are focused on. And that is the reality that, yes, this is still a cyclical industry, and the cyclical nature is driven, as we've discussed in the past, by 2 human emotions, fear and greed. And for those that want to drill down into that more, we can do that offline.\nBut the simple reality is that this is an industry that is splintered. And what I mean by that is, once upon a time, most P&C product lines marched throughout the cycle somewhat in lockstep. And what we are seeing more and more is major product lines, yes, still operating and behaving in a cyclical manner, but they are very different points in the cycle. And we are just seeing that in a more and more pronounced way.\nAnd when people talk about where is the marketplace, I don't think that there is one answer anymore. It needs to be more granular. It needs to be where is the property market, where is the comp market, where is GL, et cetera, and one can even get more granular than that. So I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about through our lens how we're thinking about major product lines and where those product lines stand in the cycle. And what are some of the realities stemming from that.\nSo perhaps a place to start would be property. Clearly, it has gotten a lot of headlines over the past couple of years. I think many have been waiting for discipline to finally turn up, and it seems like it is arriving. We have seen it in a much more pronounced manner in the reinsurance marketplace. And we've seen it begin to sprout some green shoots of discipline in the insurance marketplace with undoubtedly more to come.\nAs far as the property insurance marketplace, we were a little bit disappointed by the lack of discipline that appeared in the fourth quarter. We are convinced we're going to see it more and more as we make our way through '23. But the simple fact is it wasn't there. And we've been scratching our head trying to figure out why. When everybody knows, reinsurance costs are going up, both cat and risk. And you would think that as soon as that becomes apparent, one needs to start to factor that into how you price your product.\nThe cost of that capacity is going up. And one also needs to remember that these reinsurance covers are not risk attracting, they are losses occurring. So as you're writing business in the fourth quarter, to the extent you're able to, you really need to be not just contemplating, but incorporating into your pricing, what that new reinsurance capacity is going to cost even if it doesn't take effect till [1/1] because that capacity is going to be supporting the risks for a part of a year that you wrote in the fourth quarter or even the third quarter and earlier.\nThe property market from our perspective is poised for material hardening. We, I think, are thought of by some as an out of property market. And quite frankly, while we have been and are having more of a liability bent, it would be a mistake to think that we do not have the skills and the appetite for property when we think it makes sense, when we believe it is a good risk-adjusted return. And there is a better-than-average chance from our perspective, the marketplace is moving in that direction. Clearly, it's getting there on the reinsurance front and more to come again in our opinion on the insurance front.\nMaybe pivoting over to workers' compensation. I think there was either a poem or a song or something that went something along the lines of waiting for the world to change. So this is one that I clearly have missed the timing on. I had thought that the world would have figured it out by now as far as where things are going and what people need to be doing from a loss cost perspective, clearly, I was mistaken. From my perspective, based on what I see and I believe, my colleagues' perspective, is that comp is likely going to continue to bump along the bottom throughout '23, and we can look forward to '24 and beyond, hopefully, for some considerable firming, which, again, is something to look forward to.\nBut in the meantime, clearly requires thought and discipline. And quite frankly, from our perspective, it's a little bit unnerving that some rating bureaus seem to not be appropriately taking into account or adjusting for the frequency benefit that occurred during COVID. Additionally, we think one needs to be very thoughtful about severity trends as well and what that could mean in the future, especially on the medical front.\nAuto is another product line that we think requires thought and judgment. From my perspective, I don't think that there's a product line today that is more susceptible than auto to social inflation, if you like. And the good news is there is rate to be had if you go after it. The challenging news is you better make sure you're getting it. Otherwise, it's very easy these days to fall behind loss costs.\nI'm going to lump GL excess and umbrella into one pot, which is kind of inappropriate, but in the interest of time, I'm going to do it. I think those are amongst the brighter opportunities at this stage. Clearly, again, one needs to be mindful of social inflation, but the rate is there to be had. I would tell you of that universe that I'm referring to, the only one area that is -- I wouldn't say concerning, but is on the watch list is the large account excess business, the large sort of Fortune 5000 towers.\nThere's been a huge amount of rate that's been achieved in that marketplace, but one needs to be very mindful as to how quickly that could potentially erode. Other than that, I think there's a lot of opportunity there. Pivoting over to professional liability, I would suggest that it's very much 2 stories there. I would say, on one hand, you have D&O. And then on the other hand, you have, by and large, everything else. The D&O market a few years ago took off like a rocket ship with massive rate increases to say the least.\nAnd at this stage, it is gradually coming down to earth. I would suggest that the parachute may have a couple of small holes in it, but it requires monitoring. That is clearly becoming a more competitive marketplace. Other than D&O, professional liability, we think, offers a great deal of opportunity, and we view that as a place for us to continue to lean into.\nI would suggest smaller part of the marketplace, hospital professional liability is also an area that requires thought and caution. Finally, reinsurance, with all due respect to my friends and colleagues in the reinsurance space, I think perhaps the expression that even a broken clock is right twice a day. Well, this is one of those moments when the clock is right. And we will see with time how much discipline really is in the market and how long it remains or what the staying power is.\nI know that there was a lot of attention put towards property cat and what 1/1 was going to hold. Clearly, it was a firming marketplace. We did participate in that. I would tell you that the U.S. market was at least at 1/1 , considerably more attractive than what I would define as the international market or ex U.S. So what does this all mean for us as we sort of pivot to the [mirror] and talk about our quarter before we get into a few follow-up on Rich's comments.\nI think what it means for us is there is still great opportunity. I think what it does also mean is that we need to continue to be focused, disciplined and prepared to pivot as opportunities present themselves and as they diminish and other opportunities present themselves. It's one of the great things about our organization and the breadth of our offering and our structure. We are a collection of specialty companies where we have teams of people with great expertise focused on their niche.\nThese teams of people understand cycle management, and they understand their loss costs and how to deploy and manage capital. So long story short, we think we're in a pretty good place. As always, you're going to see parts of the business growing, other parts of the business, perhaps shrinking as we capitalize on opportunities.\nPivoting to the quarter. Again, I'm not going to belabor this because I think, Rich, as always, did a great job. But a couple of observations on the top line, you talked about the FX impact. I would also suggest rate and rate adequacy continue to be and will always be our priority. As we see new opportunities presenting themselves, I flagged property earlier on.\nOur presence within the E&S space, I think, is going to create meaningful opportunity for us certainly over -- somewhere between the next 12 to 36 months depending on cat activity, quite frankly. But again, we will see with time. As far as rate goes, as you would have seen from the release, we got just shy of 7 points of rate and we think that, that comfortably helps us keep up with trend and more likely than not, perhaps we're exceeding trend.\nOne of the things just on the topic of rate. And I apologize if you find this repetitive, but it's something that does come up from time to time is confusion that exists between renewal premium versus renewal rate increase. Our definition and our true north in our effort to make sure we understand loss cost and margin is the number of dollars that we are collecting per unit of exposure. It's not about the amount of premium that we happen to collect.\nIf I'm running a trucking company and I have 5 trucks. And at the renewal, it turns out that my number of trucks has gone from 5 to 10, and I end up collecting twice as much premium. That's not a rate increase. That means I got twice as much premium, but I got twice as much exposure. And in theory, I need to get more than that to keep up with trend.\nSo when we talk about rate increase, let there be no misunderstanding. We're not talking about increase in premium even though ultimately, it may have nurtured that. Our focus is on the amount of money we collect for unit of exposure. And we work very hard to make sure that when we are comparing unit of exposure to unit of exposure over corresponding period that we have unpacked that, so it is as close to apples-to-apples as one can establish.\nAnother comment that I did want to make is on renewal retention ratio. Obviously, different product lines, different parts of the business, we target different levels of renewal retention. When we look at our portfolio overall, we look for the renewal retention to sort of float somewhere between 77 and 80, maybe 81 depending on the mix. When we see that renewal retention ratio ticking up above that, from our perspective, it is an invitation to be pushing rate harder.\nWe want to be in the market at a granular level, testing it every day to be getting as much rate as we can to ensure that we are at a minimum at rate adequacy. That's a very important thing that is a priority for us as an organization. One last quick comment on the top line that we've talked about in the past, which, again, I think speaks to quality integrity. Our new business relativity for the year was above 100 or above 1, if you will, which means we are charging a bit more for new business than renewal again for the year.\nMoving on to the losses. Rich covered that. I know there may be some folks maybe at a high level, okay, 60.6. For those of you that subscribe to the [but 4], you may be looking at the 59.3. What you may not realize and I'm about to share with you is that we've had some fire losses in the quarter, and it wasn't in any particular operating unit. It was pretty widespread. And that added somewhere between 1 point -- maybe 1.25 to the loss ratio. We saw it both in the insurance business amongst various operating units, and we saw it in the reinsurance business, too. So we are focused on that, trying to make sure that there's not something that we're missing here. And to the extent there is, we want to be tending to it quickly.\nOne last data point, which, again, I've qualified in the past, and I'm going to qualify now is not the whole story, but we believe it is a relevant data point is the paid loss ratio. A couple of historical data points that I'm going to give it to you for the -- these are going to be for the full year, that way, you don't need to worry about seasonality or anything along those lines. Paid loss ratio for 2017, 57%; '18, 57%; '19, 55%; '20, 52%, '21, 45%; '22, 45%. You can interpret that and extrapolate any way you want. I view it as a data point that doesn't tell the whole story, nevertheless, a valuable data point.\nRich talked about the expense ratio, 27.8%. Certainly, the whole team on this end we continue to try and make sure that we are getting good value for the money that is spent. Obviously, as it relates to compensation, we are trying to make sure that we have done a reasonable job on behalf of our colleagues keeping up with cost of living, and I think we've done a good job staying on top of that. And as Rich also mentioned, we have ongoing investments on the technology front, which we think are very important for the future. Could it tick up a little bit from here? Yes. Do I think that we are focused, as Rich said, in keeping it below 30 and remaining competitive? Absolutely.\nAnd we are constantly making sure that our acquisition cost is thoughtful. Maybe just spending a couple of moments following on Rich's comments on the investment front as he flags duration sitting at 2.4 years, the book yield 3.6%. And I think as Rich flagged and I will flag again, the new money rate these days is north of 4.5%, we're flirting with 5%. So I will leave it to others to fill in the blanks as to what this means for our economic model.\nBut obviously, when you think about the spread between the book yield and the new money rate and what we're able to achieve and you extrapolate that for what it means for our economic model, I think it is very encouraging. One last quick comment on the investment front. While we are not in a rush and we are going to do it in a very thoughtful way, we certainly are considering beginning to push that duration out towards 2.6 years, maybe more towards 2.8 years over time. But again, we are not in a rush. We're going to do that in an opportunistic way as windows open and close.\nSo since I'm onto most of you folks that as soon as the Q&A is over, everyone starts hanging up, I'm going to just offer a couple of quick summary comments, and then we will move on to the Q&A. I think we had by any measure, a very strong year. And I think that when you look at how the business is positioned, while nobody knows exactly with certainty what tomorrow will bring, we have a lot of pieces laid out in good position for the coming years to be very attractive for the business.\nI think that is both the case on the investment side as well as on the underwriting side. As I suggested a few moments ago, you can see where the book yield is and where the new money rate is and what that means. In addition to that, you can see the rate increases that are earning through and what that is going to mean for the business. I know that there are some that are wondering why is it that we have not dropped our loss picks more quickly. And it is certainly something that we look at and we visit and we revisit.\nBut you need to please understand that we are acutely aware to some of -- of some of the unknowns and how leveraged the model is, and we want to make sure that we do not take the cake out of the oven prematurely. So with that, I think people have probably had more than enough of me. Bo, why don't we please open it up for questions please. Thank you."

Berkley Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.\nThe speakers' remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including, without limitation, believes, expects or estimates. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our other filings made with the SEC for a description of the business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results. W. R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nBo, thank you very much. And let me echo your welcome to all to our third quarter call. We appreciate your finding time to join us. Joining me on this end of the call is also Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman; as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow our typical agenda where, on very short order, I'm going to be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. I will follow with a couple of observations on my end, and then you will have the 3 of us at your disposal to take a Q&A session anywhere people would like to take it.\nBefore I hand it over to Rich, I did want to flag or raise a thought for participants' consideration, and it's something that we spent a good deal of time thinking about on our end. And it particularly comes into focus during periods of time like what we saw in the third quarter when cat activity spikes considerably. And great attention, amongst many, turns to trying to understand exposures, trying to understand claims activity and what does that mean from a dollars and cents perspective. And those questions are well placed and are all important and appropriate.\nThat having been said, in the flurry of activity around trying to understand what has transpired from a financial perspective, it is easy to lose sight of the more, what I would call, the human aspect and the loss that has occurred and how that impacts individuals, not just their homes being destroyed, but oftentimes something even more severe such as the loss of life.\nSo I did want to just comment on this that it is something that my colleagues and I pay great attention to, we are sensitive to, and all of those impacted by the events of the third quarter are certainly in our thoughts. Furthermore, we have many colleagues, particularly on the claims side of the business, that are working tirelessly to make sure that we as an organization are servicing customers, making sure we as an organization are living up to our commitments and our promises, which is something we take very seriously.\nAnd finally, from our perspective, to the extent there is any type of silver lining in these types of situations, clearly, it is an opportunity for the industry to demonstrate the value that it brings to society. We cannot undo what has been done, but we certainly are in a position to assist society in picking up the pieces and trying to put it back together. That is not just an obligation but an opportunity that we as an organization take very seriously.\nSo I will leave it there for the moment. And now, Rich, if you wouldn't mind taking us through the numbers having said all that. Rich, please?\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nSure. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate that. Operating income increased 14.2% to $282 million or $1.01 per share with operating return on equity of 16.9%. Net income of $229 million or $0.82 per share resulted in a return on equity of 13.8%. The company reported strong underwriting income in spite of the industry-wide catastrophe events. In addition, the record quarterly net investment income and foreign currency gains resulting from the strong U.S. dollar contributed to our excellent quarterly results.\nPretax underwriting income of $192 million demonstrates the resiliency of our underwriting portfolio in an environment facing many challenges, including social and economic inflation as well as frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. We reported pretax catastrophe losses of $94 million in the quarter with 3.9 loss ratio points compared with $74 million or 3.5 loss ratio points in the prior year. Probably of no surprise, the main driver in the quarter was Hurricane Ian. We developed our best estimate on a ground-up basis, operating unit by operating unit, the predominance of which is IBNR due to the timing of the event.\nFocusing next on our top line. The company grew gross premiums written to a record of almost $3.1 billion. Net premiums written increased 10.8% to approximately $2.6 billion. Breaking this down further between segments, Insurance grew 11.5% to $2.2 billion, while Reinsurance & Monoline Excess increased 6.8% to $340 million. Exposure growth is a significant contributor to the increase in premium.\nThe current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 30 basis points over the prior year to 58.6%. Prior year loss reserves developed unfavorably by 1.6 loss ratio points in the current quarter, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 64.1%. Record quarterly net premiums earned benefited the expense ratio of 28%. We continue to invest in the business and identify strategies to operate more efficiently and optimize our technological capabilities.\nWrapping up underwriting performance. Our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.6%, and our calendar year combined ratio was 92.1%. Record quarterly net investment income of $203 million was led by growth in the core portfolio of 51% and better-than-average investment fund results despite the significant downturn in the equity markets. The increased invested asset base, along with higher interest rates, is contributing to much of the growth in the core portfolio. Book yields on the fixed maturity securities has sequentially improved each quarter this year with 2.2% in the first quarter, 2.6% in the second quarter and 3% in the current quarter. The short duration of our investment portfolio of 2.4 years, combined with strong operating cash flows of almost $1.8 billion year-to-date, should contribute to further growth in net investment income and improving book yields. At the same time, the short duration of the portfolio and high credit quality of AA- has tempered the market value impact on book value.\nAs it relates to the investment funds, our diversification strategy has benefited our results to date despite certain funds' correlation with the equity markets. Our investment funds are reported on a 1-quarter lag. And in light of the third quarter deterioration in the broader equity markets, we may see our fourth quarter results impacted. Pretax net investment losses in the quarter of $67 million is primarily attributable to the net change in unrealized losses on equity securities of $50 million, which largely related to sector declines in technology and financial services.\nStockholders' equity was more than $6.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. Strong earnings of about $1 billion on a year-to-date basis has mostly offset the impact from rising interest rates on unrealized losses. At the same time, we proactively managed our capital position as evidenced through regular and special dividends of approximately $209 million year-to-date, along with share repurchases in the third quarter of almost $7 million. Fitch validated this view of our financial strength early last week with an upgrade to AA- from A+.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nRich, thank you very much. So let me just offer a few comments. I promise I'll keep it on the brief side, though I think I say that every time and I rarely do, but I guess it depends on your definition of brief.\nSo the marketplace overall remains a very interesting one from our perspective. There are pockets of the market that remain extremely attractive, and there are others that is surprising the level of competition. One of the observations that we have shared in the past and we continue to see very much a reality is how the market is still as cyclical as ever. That having been said, different product lines are marching not in lockstep but very much to the beat of their own drum, which translates to, they are at different points in the cycle at any moment in time.\nI would tell you that the specialty space, in particular, the E&S space, remains very attractive. In addition to that, I would tell you that if it is a piece of business that falls within the appetite of the standard market, particularly a national carrier and some regional carriers, it is shocking to us how competitive some participants are willing to be.\nThat having been said, if you have an opportunity to look at our release and you look at Page 7, you would have seen the different product lines and where the growth is coming from. Certainly, in our opinion, if a leading indicator is if we are growing at a healthy rate, it means that we think there is margin there, and we are leaning into it. When you look at the various product lines, certainly, short-tail lines, in particular, property, as of late is demonstrating more opportunity. In addition to that, when you look at the reinsurance space, we are seeing a similar opportunity, and it is likely you'll see us leaning into that even more.\nOn the other hand, you have professional liability with particularly public D&O standing out as a product line that has become increasingly competitive, and workers' compensation, that is a product line that we've been talking to those that are willing to listen for an extended period of time that we've been surprised by the level of competition. You might say, \"How do you reconcile that with the growth rate that you have in the product line during the period?\" To make a long story short, it's just exposure, if you will, growth in payroll.\nOverall, we as an organization benefit from the diversity of our product offering. As a result of that, at any moment in time, there are parts of our portfolio that are shrinking, and there are parts of our portfolio that are growing and growing dramatically. We are in the marketplace every day trying to optimize. The market may move towards us. It may move away from us, but we are consistently there at a rate that we think is appropriate or then some.\nWhen you look at the growth that Rich talked about in the quarter, approximately 11%, we think, is reasonably healthy. Again, the discipline on the professional liability that I alluded to a few moments ago, I think, has created a little bit of a headwind.\nThat having been said, our discipline remains with our renewal retention ratio remaining at approximately 80%. And we are getting a bit of a premium on new business relative to our existing portfolio, which as we've discussed in the past, we think, makes sense because you know more about your renewal book and your new book. As you would have also picked up during -- it's somewhere in the release, we made some good progress on the rate front coming in at 7.3% ex workers' comp. And at that pace, we're quite comfortable that in the aggregate, we are keeping up with trend.\nI think another data point that's important, particularly in an inflationary market, and that is audit premiums, to what extent, if the exposure is growing, are you capturing that and making sure after the policy incepts that you're going back to collect everything you should have. And we were pleased to see the growth in our audit premiums over the corresponding period last year, up 42%.\nRich walked through with the loss ratio with you all, the 64.1%. For those that subscribe to the but-for model, it's at 58.6%, the 64.1%. When the day is all done, in my opinion, that is reality. That having been said, breaking it down, Rich walked you through the cats of 3.9. And the last piece as far as the development goes was essentially entirely related to what I would define as isolated and unique events stemming from COVID. And to the best of our knowledge and as clearly as we can see it, we do not envision this being an ongoing issue. Again, we view it as isolated to 2 unique situations, and that's how it looks to us at this point. So that's to the best of our knowledge.\nWith the 58.6%, as Rich flagged, a bit of a small step in the right direction, an improvement of, call it, 30 basis points on the ex cat accident year. Look, when the day is all done, we are pushing on the rate, and we are not going to declare victory prematurely. I understand some people have done the math and said, \"Well, why isn't your ex cat accident year loss ratio improving more?\" And it's because of something called inflation that comes in 2 different flavors that we are exposed to, both financial or economic as well as social.\nExpense ratio at 28%, we think that is pretty healthy by any measure, particularly for a specialty writer. Some of the realities that we had talked about during COVID and the COVID benefit on expenses, those are starting to dissipate as people are traveling and entertainment is coming back to be part of our business. That having been said, also, costs are going up. We are not just focused on inflation as far as raising our rates and what it means for our loss costs and how we're responding to that with rate increases. Also, it impacts our operational costs in making -- whether it be remuneration or any other expenses that we have.\nRich touched on the investments. I'm just going to, I guess, echo a couple of his comments. Long story short, I think we are very much being rewarded for the discipline. I have made the comment in the past how we went for many years keeping our duration short and not compromising on quality. And quite frankly, that came at a cost. There were others that were compromising on quality and taking the duration out, and they served themselves well for that day but did not position themselves particularly well for tomorrow. And guess what? Tomorrow is here.\nAs a result of that foresight and that discipline, we are enjoying the benefits as to what the impact has been on our book value as far as the unrealized or some perhaps other organizations maybe are realizing it. And in addition to that, we have the benefit of being able to put money to work at higher rates much more quickly than others. You would have -- as Rich flagged for you, our book yield ticked up considerably in a 90-day period going from about 2.6% to 3%. And obviously, you all can do the math as easily as we can as to where the new money rate is likely going given where interest rates are today. And it would seem as though that they are headed tomorrow. So we have a lot of room to push the duration out a bit if we think it makes sense, if we are getting paid for it. And we think that we are very well positioned.\nSo long story short, and I guess desperately trying to live up to my word that I would keep it short, what's the punch line? The punch line is that we are an organization that has, is and will continue to be very focused on risk-adjusted return. When we think about risk-adjusted return, we clearly take volatility into account. We have the ability to pivot from one product line to another, emphasizing and deemphasizing products as we see fit, depending on market conditions.\nCertainly, it is very possible, for example, that you will see us participate more significantly in the property cat space. It would be my expectation to the extent we chose to participate, depending on how attractive the market gets, that we would probably participate for a year or 2, unlikely more than 3 in a significant way. We are going to deploy capital with an eye towards risk-adjusted return, and we are not going to be shy to let the business go when we don't think it makes sense anymore.\nThat same focus on risk-adjusted return that applies to underwriting also, as I mentioned a moment or 2 ago, applies to our investment activities. We are disciplined. We are focused on the idea of how much risk we are taking on and are we getting paid appropriately for it. When the day is all done, we are in business to build book value for shareholders. And we think that we have been able to do that again because of our eye towards risk-adjusted return.\nSo let me pause there. And Bo, we would like to open it up for questions, if we could, please."

Berkley Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded.\nThe speakers' remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including, without limitation, believes, expects or estimates.\nWe caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us, that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our other filings made with the SEC for a description of the business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results.\nW. R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nJosh, thank you very much, and good afternoon to all, and thank you for joining our second quarter call. Co-hosting with me this afternoon is Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe're going to follow the usual agenda where I'm going to hand it over to Rich momentarily. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. Once Rich has completed his comments, I'll receive the baton back from him, offer a few thoughts on my own, and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A and take the conversation anywhere participants would like to take it.\nBefore I hand it over to Rich, there is a one pointer or topic that I did want to flag, and it's something that we talk about with some regularity within our shop. And I don't think it's a unique observation, I'm sure everyone on the call and beyond is acutely aware of this point, but nevertheless, I think it easily falls off the radar screen as we can easily get consumed by other aspects of the industry.\nAnd that is the macro observation or reality that this is a very unusual industry for a variety of reasons, but one of them is, this is an industry where you do not know your cost of goods sold until oftentimes many years after the transaction has actually occurred. That creates additional complexity and how one operates the business. It's less consequential when you're operating through an extended period of time where things are quite stable. But when you're in a period of time where changes abound, volatility is material, it becomes much more consequential.\nMost businesses in other industries, I would suggest, the way they operate is akin to how you steer a car. You turn the wheel of a car, the wheels in the front of the car turn and the car will turn quickly. Because of what we're discussing now this reality of the timing of cost of goods sold relative to when the transaction occurs, in this industry it's different from driving a car.\nIn some ways, it's more like steering a boat, where the rotor is in the back of the boat as opposed to the wheels in the front of the vehicle. The difference in this industry, like a boat or a ship being steered from the back, is one needs to anticipate. One needs to not just be consumed by what has occurred yesterday, not just be preoccupied with what is immediately in front of them, but one needs to anticipate what is coming their way because of the delay in response to steering the ship. One needs to be trying to figure out what is around the next corner or over the hill.\nThis is something that we spend a huge amount of time working at grappling with as a team. It is one of the reasons why we have been focused on certain things for a long period of time. Whether it's social inflation or economic or financial inflation, these are 2 macro topics that we have been talking about and acting upon for several years at this stage. You can see it in our underwriting and how we have selected loss picks and how we have priced our book of business.\nYou can see it in our investment portfolio and how we have managed our duration. So while these types of topics have become very topical today and we hear people chatting about it, these are things that we anticipated and have been preparing for, as I suggested earlier, years. It's one of the reasons why we are so well positioned. It's not easy. It requires expertise. It requires experience. It requires discipline. It requires foresight, and it requires courage.\nFortunately, my colleagues throughout this organization have those characteristics and traits, and that, in my opinion, is the leading reason why this organization is so well positioned today and by extension, is enjoying the results that we are talking about today and anticipate we will be talking about for many, many quarters and years to come.\nSo with that, so much for me just keeping it short at the beginning and handing it over to Rich. Let me hand it over to Rich now, and I promise I'll be somewhat brief after he provides his thoughts and comments. Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOf course. Thank you, Rob. I appreciate it. The company reported another strong quarter, as you saw, with operating income increasing 43% to $313 million or $1.12 per share. The key contributors include strong underwriting income driven by continued growth in premium volume, which I'll discuss in just a moment, along with improving net investment income and foreign currency gains.\nWe also reported net income of $179 million or $0.65 per share. Pretax underwriting income of $268 million in large part kept pace with the record first quarter, representing an increase of 32.6% over the prior year second quarter. Our year-to-date quarterly results of $543 million increased 41% over the prior year and surpassed all prior full year results with the exception of 2021, which was a record year. Despite the heightened frequency of natural catastrophes, we reported pretax cat losses of $58 million in the quarter or 2.5 loss ratio points compared with $44 million or 2.2 loss ratio points last year.\nDrilling down further into our underwriting results, gross premiums written grew to a record level of almost $3.1 billion. Net premiums written grew 16.9% to a record of nearly $2.6 billion. Our decision to retain more business on a net basis can be seen by the lower session rate in the quarter and on year-to-date basis.\nNet premiums written increased in all lines of business as we disclosed in the earnings release. The Insurance segment grew 16.6% to more than $2.3 billion while the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 19.1% to almost $260 million. The overall growth is significantly coming from increased exposure. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 0.3 loss ratio points to 58.5%.\nPrior year loss reserves developed favorably by $2 million in the current year, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 60.9%. The expense ratio continues to benefit from scaling the business as evidenced by the outpaced growth in net premiums earned relative to underwriting expenses. In addition, we continue to make investments in strategic initiatives to optimize efficiency, and as such, the expense ratio improved 1 point to 27.7% over the prior year's quarter.\nIn summary, the current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1.3 loss points to 86.2% compared with the second quarter of 2021 of 87.5%. The reported calendar year combined ratio was 88.6% for the current quarter compared with 89.7% for the prior year. Net investment income for the quarter was approximately $172 million. The rising interest rate environment is a key contributor to growth and income from the core portfolio of almost 30%.\nOn investment funds, you may recall, we report on a 1-quarter lag, and despite the decline in the equity markets in the first quarter, the investment funds performed well with a book yield of 8.3%. The transportation, real estate and energy funds led the way. The overall investment portfolio also maintained the same duration of 2.4 years and a credit quality of a AA-.\nPretax net investment losses in the quarter of $172 million is primarily attributable to the net change in unrealized losses on equity securities of $132 million, which related to sector declines in financial services, energy and metal mining and manufacturing. Stockholders' equity was $6.5 billion as of June 30, 2022. Year-to-date earnings have more than offset the change in unrealized losses on investments and currency translation adjustments, both items being components of stockholders' equity.\nWe returned capital to shareholders in the first 6 months of the year through regular and special dividends amounting to $182 million, of which $159 million was in the second quarter. The annualized operating return on beginning of year equity was 18.8% for the quarter and 10.8% on a net income basis.\nRob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nOkay. Great. Rich, thanks very much. That was great as always. Okay. So a couple of quick soundbites from me, and again, as promised, then we'll open it up for the Q&A. The top line continues to be very healthy. I would tell you that in the specialty space, in particular, E&S, but specialty in general, we are seeing continued strength in submissions, and we're feeling particularly good about that.\nWe're also seeing finally some resilience in the reinsurance market. Consequently, as you saw the growth in that segment as well. On the insurance front, jumping around here, other liability was particularly strong. Shorter tail was strong as well and commercial auto was reasonably robust. As far as what the contribution to the 17 points of growth, rate was a meaningful contributor. Ex-comp, we were at 6.8% or so.\nI think it's important that people keep in mind and not confuse or decouple rate versus exposure growth. And one of the things that we've been very focused on, and I worry that some industry participants may not be as focused on, is a change in exposure, particularly in an inflationary environment is something that we pay a lot of attention to. Obviously, there's an opportunity to keep up with it through payrolls on comp, GL. As far as revenue on the property front, the appraised values that you get at the time of the underwriting and inception. But making sure that one does not fall behind is an important thing and approximately 2/3 of our policies are adjustable based on exposure. So that's a really important piece to make sure that we can keep up with inflation.\nAs far as strength of economy, certainly, there is a lot of sensitivity and concern. But I would tell you, as far as audit premiums at this stage, we are seeing considerable momentum on that front. Our audit premiums during the quarter were up 45% relative to the same period last year. And just on the retention front, something that I know we've discussed in the past, and we're very sensitive to not churning the book and making sure that the quality and the integrity of the book is intact as we continue to push for rate and make sure that we're getting the appropriate exposure.\nLong story short, renewal retention remained just north of 80%. Loss ratio, obviously, Rich covered a bit of noise coming out of the cats. I would characterize it as frequency of modest severity and that was probably the big story behind the 2.5 points. From my perspective -- and we've heard this and we think we've talked about it in the past calls, we've heard it from some people when they look at all the rate that we've gotten. Why is it that we're not seeing the loss ratio drop even more on the current accident year.\nAnd the simple answer is, there's a lot of unknown, and there's a lot of volatility and there are a lot of various leverage assumptions that we want to make sure we are appropriately thoughtful and measured, and we don't respond too quickly. Some people would say cautious. We would say that we're just being thoughtful and measured given the inflationary environment, both social as well as economic.\nIn addition to that, and we may have touched on this last quarter, we're sensitive to the backlog in the legal system. And our best estimate, which is nothing more than an estimate is that due to COVID, there's still probably an 18-month backlog in the court system. One other piece on the loss ratio, and I think I shared this with all last quarter. And for us, it's just one of many data points that we pay attention to, and perhaps, it's of interest to you all and that's the paid loss ratio. From our perspective, it is an important data point. It's not the whole story, but an important data point.\nSo here's a little bit of historical perspective for you again on Q2. And I'm going to give you what the paid loss ratio was going back to 2017 for Q2 as that creates as much of an apples-to-apples basis as we can, at least using shorthand. So the paid loss ratio Q2 in '17 was a 55.9. In '18, it was a 58.3. In '19, it was a 53.8. In 2020, it was 52.9. In '21, it was a 44.3. And in '22, it was 41.9. So obviously, an attractive trend. Doesn't necessarily tell the whole story, but again, from our perspective, a meaningful data point and an encouraging indicator.\nExpense ratio, again, Rich touched on this. We continue to see improvement for a whole host of reasons. Certainly, lots of folks are focused on it and trying to be more efficient, but the big needle mover is just the growth in the earned premium. And as you can see how it lags our written, there's likely more opportunity there over time. That having been said, we do have a few new operations. We'll have to see how they scale again over time.\nSo 88.6 reported. If you back out the cats and you do the butt forward, it's an 86.2. On an operating basis, obviously, a pretty attractive return by virtually any measure.\nA couple of quick comments on the investment portfolio, and again, I think Rich summarized it well. So I'm not going to belabor the point too much here, but obviously, the duration remains notably short of where our liabilities are at 2.4 years compared to the liabilities, give or take, 4 years.\nI think it's also worth noting, you're just in the early stages of seeing the opportunity for this company and its earnings power when you saw the book yield of climb from -- in the last quarter, last quarter being Q1 2.2 up to 2.6 in just a period of 90 days. And new money rate for us these days is certainly north of 4, probably 4.25, give or take.\nWe talked at the beginning of the call about foresight and discipline and a variety of other behaviors or traits and the importance of it. I think it has certainly been exercised on the underwriting side, but it is important to recognize how it has been also exercised on the investment side. The earnings power of this economic model going forward in a raising or increasing rate environment should not be underestimated.\nIt's something we've discussed in the past. I think it's something that people have an understanding for when we have the discussion, but I'm not sure if it's fully appreciated what this means for our economic model and again, the earnings power of the business as you see interest rates continue to move up.\nSo again, when we look forward, given the opportunities that we have before us, the flow of business coming our way continues to have significant momentum. The opportunity to make sure that we are getting the rate that we want and need continues to be there as well. And of course, the leverage that we have that is very much coming our way on the investment income side, I think all these things position us well for not just the coming quarters, but the coming years in all likelihood.\nSo let me pause there, Josh, if we could please open it up for questions."

Berkley Corporation's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded.\nThe speakers' remarks may contain forward-looking statements.

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director\n\nThank you very much, and good afternoon, all, and thank you for finding time to join us for our Q1 call. On this end of the call, in addition to myself, you also have Bill Berkley, Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, our Group CFO.\nWe're going to follow the usual agenda where I'm in short order, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk through the highlights of the quarter. Then once he's completed his comments, I'll tag along with a few of my own observations. And shortly thereafter, we'll be opening it up for Q&A and happy to take the conversation in any direction participants would like to do so.\nThat having been said, before I do hand it over to Rich, because I always like to steal at least a little bit of his thunder, though I don't think the comments will come as a surprise to anyone that's had an opportunity to review the release. It was a terrific quarter for the organization, really, by any metric to say the least. And quite frankly, we were able to achieve these results because of the efforts of the full team across the country and around the world all working together to achieve these types of outcomes.\nI think what's important to that point is to just remind ourselves, remind each other that this effort, this is a team sport, as I've commented in the past, it's not an individual sport. And quite frankly, this isn't rocket science what we're doing. Yes, we are very fortunate that we have a lot of very intelligent people on the team working very hard, but a lot of our success comes about because of discipline; because we focus on blocking and tackling in a thoughtful and consistent way every day; because we are not only consumed by what's in the rearview mirror, but we are paying close attention to what we see out the front windshield.\nIt seems like common sense. But quite frankly, it requires great effort every day. And again, I think we're achieving these types of results because of the efforts of the full team. So congratulations to all.\nI think beyond just the results, which again, I think, speak for themselves, I would suggest that perhaps what's as, if not more exciting, is quite frankly, how the table has been set for what is likely going to be a very strong balance of '22. Additionally, how things are being set up for what should be a very strong '23. And with every passing day, there are more pieces being put into place that would suggest that it's more likely than not that '24 will also be very promising as well.\nSo we, as an organization, continue to be very focused on building book value. We have an obsession around the concept of risk-adjusted return. I think that came into focus not just in this quarter, but in our ability to generate good returns regardless of what may have happened on the cat front in any quarter, it's the consistency have strong results that differentiate us in the marketplace.\nSo with that, let me hand it over to Rich to walk us through some of the highlights, and I will be back on the heels of his comments. Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it. The company continues to operate extremely well, as Rob had pointed out, reporting record quarterly underwriting income and net investment gains, both of which led to the 157% growth to record quarterly net income of $591 million or $2.12 per share on a common stock split effected basis.\nOperating earnings also improved 52% to $307 million or $1.10 per share on a common stock split effected basis. The primary contributors were improvement in underwriting results by 2.3 points to a calendar year combined ratio of 87.8% and growth in net investment income of almost 9.5%.\nGoing more into the details with our top line first. Gross premiums written grew 15.1% to a quarterly record of approximately $2.9 billion. Net premiums written also grew 17.7% to a record of more than $2.4 billion. The higher growth in net premiums written is driven by our decision to retain more business, which is evident by the lower session rate.\nIn the Insurance segment, all lines of business grew, generating a combined 19.2% increase to total net premiums written of almost $2.1 billion. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment also increased 9.6% to more than $300 million, driven by growth in casualty Reinsurance & Monoline Excess. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in premium, which will continue to earn through the income statement and can be seen by the higher growth rate in net premiums earned compared with net premiums written.\nRecord pretax quarterly underwriting income of $274 million surpassed multiple quarterly records last year. The quarter improved $92 million and more than 50% over the prior year. Catastrophe losses were well within expectations at $29 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. This compares with $36 million or 1.9 loss ratio points in the first quarter of 2021. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 0.6 loss ratio points to 58.3%, primarily driven by rate improvement. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by almost $1 million in the current quarter, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 59.5%.\nExpense ratio is in line with expectations at 28.3%, reflecting an improvement of 1.2 points over the prior year's quarter. As previously mentioned, the growth in net premiums earned continues to benefit the expense ratio even with higher fixed costs coming from compensation, a new operating unit and increasing travel and entertainment.\nIn summary, these components contributed to our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 86.5% for the quarter compared with 88.4% for the first quarter of 2021. Net investment income increased almost 9.5% to $174 million for the quarter. The growth is primarily related to an improvement in investment funds of 33.6% in the core portfolio of 11.7%. Investment funds outperformed in the real estate, financial services and transportation funds. And the core portfolio benefited from rising interest rates and dividends received on equity securities.\nThe investment portfolio also maintained the same duration of 2.4 years and credit quality of a AA-. In addition, our strong operating cash flow has enabled us to put more money to work despite retaining a significant position in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.1 billion. Record pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $366 million is primarily made up of net realized gains on investments of $277 million and the change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $93 million. The key contributor to the realized gains was the sale of the real estate investment in London of $317 million gross or $251 million net of transaction expenses and the foreign currency impact including the reversal of the currency translation adjustment.\nCorporate expenses increased primarily due to performance-based compensation arising in connection with the record level of earnings. The effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter, reflecting a onetime benefit from the release of a valuation allowance arising from the utilization of tax attributes as well as investments in tax-exempt securities and dividend-paying equity securities.\nStockholders' equity increased to almost $6.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of 3.2% over the prior year-end. Book value per share before dividends increased 3.5% in the quarter and would have marginally increased even without the gain from the sale of the real estate investment in London. The annualized return on beginning of year equity was 35.5% for the quarter and 18.5% on an operating earnings basis.\nRob, I'll turn it back to you for further comments.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director\n\nOkay. Rich, thank you very much. That was great. So let me keep this somewhat brief because I'm sure people have their own topics and questions that I'd like to get on to. But maybe just through my lens, a couple of sound bites.\nThe top line, obviously, just shy 18%, from my perspective, by any measure is very healthy. And if we unpack that a little bit, a couple of other data points for folks, as far as the rate increase, that's a component in their ex comp. It came in at 8.3. And let me give you a couple other numbers, and then I want to dig into this a little bit more.\nSo the new business relativity, which is a metric that we've shared with some of you in the past, is how we measure our new business pricing relative to our renewal pricing. From our perspective, when you look at new business, one needs to recognize that there, oftentimes -- not always, but oftentimes, could be more risk associated with it. Your renewal book you know more about, new business you know less about. And to make a long story short, our new business relativity for the quarter came in at 1.018. So what does that mean? That means based on our macro measurements, we're charging just shy of 2% more for new business relative to renewal business.\nAnother -- at least in my opinion, relevant data point, is our renewal retention ratio came in at 82% and change. Why is that important? Because it tells you that we're -- to get the growth, we're not churning the book. We are keeping the portfolio intact. And from our perspective, that is a very healthy number. And certainly, from our perspective, also is an invitation, if you will, to keep pursuing additional rate.\nI think that when you look at the 8.3%, it's also important that people understand that there's several dimensions that we're able to see that perhaps those from the outside looking in can't see. We look at this business by operating unit, by product line, and are constantly assessing the margin that we believe exists in the business. And there is a constant balance or rebalancing that we are doing on a daily basis as to what type of rate we need, what margin we think is in the business. And at what point in time when we see the margin that is available is growth of exposure the priority or is rate the priority. And between those 2 components, which one is more of a priority. So at this stage, we feel very good about the available margin. And as a result, in many product lines, we are willing to allow exposure growth to be the priority over rate, though not across the board.\nI also want to spend a couple of moments talking about -- just staying on that topic of exposure. Because, obviously, for some number of years, we've been beating the drum about social inflation. I think we were on the earlier side compared to many of our peers. Some folks may have labeled us Chicken Little, but nevertheless, I am grateful that our colleagues have the insight, and we took the action that we did. That having been said, obviously, as of late, this concept of economic or financial inflation seems to be getting all the headlines with good reason. And it's important, I think, for observers to understand, to take into account, that in our organization's case -- I can't speak to others, but in this organization's case, the majority of the policies that we write are based on or priced off of, if you will, exposure. So what do I mean by that? I mean we price our policies off of payroll, off of receipts or revenue, or off of appraised value, which is done in a very timely manner at the time when we are underwriting the policy.\nSo I mentioned this because as people are grappling with what is the impact of economic inflation on our business model. Certainly, we are not insulated from it. We will, in a couple of moments, potentially get into the discussion around what does it mean for the investment portfolio. But from an underwriting perspective, while we are not completely insulated, the majority of our business activities, the pricing, if you will, feeds off of exposure. I.e., in other words, if you own a deli and you are charging $1 more a sandwich, and we are pricing your GL. We are pricing off of your revenue and your receipts. Consequently, the premium is going up as your revenue and receipts are going up. That is separate and distinct from rate. Rate is a separate activity, if you will, and how one thinks about it from exposure growth. And again, obviously, inflation, to a great -- economic inflation to a great extent, is contemplated in exposure growth.\nA couple of quick soundbites on the loss ratio. Continued improvement from there. As Rich mentioned, we did have some cat activity. Really, the 2 pieces that are most noteworthy would be: one, the European storms during the quarter as well as the Australian floods. To the extent people want more detail, we can certainly get into that in the Q&A or probably best just to pick it up in the queue.\nThe other piece I wanted to flag on the loss ratio, and I may have touched on this last quarter, I can't remember, and I didn't go back and look at the transcript. But it's something I look at and perhaps it's of interest to others. And that is the paid loss ratio. This going to -- which came in, in the quarter at a 45.3. I'd like to give you a couple of historical data points, which you could always dig up on your own, but let me save you the work. And the numbers I'm going to read off are over the past couple of years, for the first quarter, what the paid loss ratio was. And I want to give it to you for the corresponding periods because that way we're getting as close to apples-to-apples as possible. Though it's not a perfect comparison because of mix of business, et cetera. But if we again, 2022 for the quarter, it came in at 45.3.\nSo let's go back to 2017. If you go back to 2017, Q1, paid loss ratio, 55.5; 2018 Q1 paid loss ratio 58.8; 2019 paid loss ratio 54.2; 2020 loss -- paid loss ratio, 56.1; 2021 paid loss ratio for the first quarter, 48.2. So I flag it because it's one of the first things that my father taught me about the insurance business. The paid loss ratio, there's really not much room for gray. It's a black and white number. It's a real number. And again, I think that it is 1 data point, which people can interpret anyway they want, but I think it's, in my opinion, a helpful indicator or trend as to where things are going.\nRich talked about the expenses. Obviously, there are 2 things that we're experience -- 3 things that we're experiencing there. A, earned premium continues to grow. We're getting a benefit there. Going the other way, T&E is starting to pick up again as, fortunately, knock on wood, COVID is hopefully in the rearview mirror and shrinking. And then lastly, we have 1 new operation, which now is feeding into the reported expense ratio. And it takes time for it to scale as we've discussed in the past, and we're confident it will be accretive over time.\nLet me offer a couple of quick soundbites on the investment portfolio, and then I promise I'll be finishing up, and it will be the participants' turn.\nThe investment portfolio, I think, is a great example of some of the comments that I offered earlier around a focus towards discipline, a focus out the front windshield, not just the rearview mirror. And quite frankly, I think we started to see some benefit really towards the end of last year, and that benefit is really starting to crystallize and likely more to come.\nSo as Rich mentioned, duration for the portfolio at the end of the quarter was 2.4 years. Another data point, the book yield on the portfolio was 2.2%. Given where interest rates have gone, our new money rate in the quarter is approximately 100 basis points above that. So as they say, you can do the math and figure out what does the 100 basis points benefit mean for our investment income on our -- for our investment income, given the movement in rates that we are seeing on the fixed income portfolio. So when we talk about the table being set for the future and the opportunities coming our way and what this means for our economic model and the earnings power of the business, I think that's an important data point for people to be considering, again, in my opinion.\nAnother point that I'd like to make, and quite frankly, it's a little bit of a pet peeve around here, and that has to do with gains. Certainly, we've noticed that people have a tendency to back gains out of our results. And quite frankly, people can look at the numbers anyway they want. But from our perspective, we think that, that's just not appropriate. We give up a fair amount of operating income, if you will, to invest in alternatives, particularly some of the activities that have a focus towards gain. We are focused on total return, and we think that is what is in the best interest of the shareholders. And again, obviously, we take an approach very focused on risk-adjusted return.\nSo I think that we are already benefiting from the discipline that we have exercised over the past several years, keeping that duration short. I think that benefit is going to be coming more and more into focus over the coming quarters and years. And quite frankly, I think it was a few quarters ago, we talked about how, quite frankly, if rates move up, we didn't think that we were getting paid enough by taking the duration out. I think that reality has come into focus. And I think in part, that was demonstrated, as Rich referenced a few moments ago. But if you look at our book value, and even if you chose, which I do not agree with, but even if you chose to back out the gain from the building that we sold in London, our book value, in spite of what happened with interest rates, still went up, which I think given what has happened in the bond market, is pretty outstanding. So again, congratulations, job well done to my colleagues on the investment side.\nSo that was probably a lot more than anyone was looking for or bargained for, but thank you for your patience and listening to me. And Emma, why don't I pause there, and let's open it up for questions."

Berkley Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. The speaker's remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, including, without limitation, believes, expects or estimates. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved.\nPlease refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our other filings made with the SEC for a description of the business environment in which we operate and the important factors that may materially affect our results. W. R. Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director\n\nJosh, thank you very much, and good afternoon all. And I would echo Josh's comment welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me are cohosting with me is also Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman; and Rich Baio, Group CFO. We're going to follow a similar agenda to what we've done in the past. I'm going to hand it over to Rich in short order. He's going to walk us through some of the highlights from the quarter and the year, and then he'll hand it back to me. I'll offer a couple of quick thoughts, and then we'll quickly move on to the Q&A session.\nBut before I do hand it over to Rich, I did want to make a couple of very quick comments. I guess number one is, I think anyone who's has had an opportunity to have a look at the release, you would have recognized that it was a great year, and it was a great way to finish off with a sort of -- this doesn't happen on its own, and I just wanted to take again a moment to both thank and congratulate my colleagues. This is very much a team sport, so the appreciation goes to everyone throughout the organization.\nLet me pivot also to a couple of macro observations. We can obviously get consumed by the results of the past 90 days or the results for the year. But we also spent a good deal of time thinking about what the business is going to be doing going forward, how we are positioned for the environment that we see coming our way. And quite frankly, we are very encouraged on multiple fronts. If we start by examining the underwriting side of the business, the growth that you saw throughout the year, including the fourth quarter remains very robust. It's coming through in both exposure as well as rates, and we really do not see that losing momentum. And Rich and I will be talking a little bit more about that later on.\nBut again, as we see it, the growth will continue and the rate increases. There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to be able to get rate increases that outpace trend by something that would be measured in the hundreds of basis points. So again, very promising front. Turning over for a moment to the investment side of the business. Again, we have, in my opinion, taking a very disciplined approach for an extended period of time in keeping not just the quality high, but the duration short.\nAs we've discussed in the past, this has come at a price. But we think that we're going to be rewarded for that discipline going forward as you see interest rates moving up. You're going to see an opportunity for us to invest at higher rates, and you're going to see an opportunity for us to, under those circumstances, take the duration back out or extended. Both of these circumstances on the underwriting side and how we are poised there as well as how we're positioned on the investment side are going to have a very meaningful impact on the company's economic model.\nAnd as this unfolds, I think it's going to be quite consequential of what it's going to mean for the earnings power of the business. So let me pause there, and I will hand it over to Rich. And I'll be back once he is through with his comments with a few other observations. And then we will, again, as promised, move it over to Q&A. Rich?\n\nRichard Mark Baio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, W. R. Berkley Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob. And obviously, I'll be focusing on the financial side here. So the company had another terrific quarter, as Rob had alluded to, with a number of areas reaching record level on a quarterly basis as well as on a full year basis. Operating income increased 64% over the prior year's quarter to a record $284 million or $1.53 per share. On a full year basis, operating income reached a record $952 million or $5.10 per share. The key contributors are related to record underwriting results for the quarter and full year as well as strong net investment income.\nThe positive momentum in the business continued throughout the year with growth in quarterly gross premiums written of 24.5% to almost $2.8 billion, bringing us to a record $10.7 billion for the full year. Similarly, net premiums written grew 26.6% toward full year of approximately $8.9 billion. On Page 7 of the earnings release, (inaudible) net premiums written by line of business for the comparable periods. All lines of business grew in the Assurant segment, including workers' compensation, albeit from incline payrolls.\nThe total for this segment amounted to $2 billion with a (inaudible) 25.8% for the prior year. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment also grew in all lines of business, totaling $273 million and growing 33% for the quarter. The growth in exposure and compounding rate improvements in most lines of business will continue to earn through the income statement. In the 3 most recent consecutive quarters, total net premiums written had an average increase of almost 26%, which has contributed to the acceleration in net premiums earned of 17% for the full year. Pretax quarterly underwriting income was a record $261 million, surpassing 2 other core records this year.\nOn a full year basis, record pretax underwriting income of $845 million was more than twice to next closest year, which occurred in 2019. The company continued to [straight] its management to cat exposes and despite heightened cat activity, such losses did not materially impact our earnings. We reported cat losses of $49 million or 2.2 loss ratio points compared with $42 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the prior year. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1 loss ratio point to 58.2%, primarily driven by rate improvements. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by approximately $1.3 million in the current quarter.\nThat brings our reported loss ratio to 60.4%. The expense ratio continued to improve over the prior year, representing a benefit of 1.8 points to 27.8%. The growth in net premiums earned continues to be a major contributor to the improvement in our expense ratio as it outpaced expenses by 7.4% in the quarter. Our newer operating units continue to grow their portfolio, adding scale to the business and moving closer to a more normalized expense ratio. We continue to make investments in the business as evidenced by the 3 newly formed operating units as we look into their future prospects.\nWe anticipate that our expense ratio for 2022 should be in the range of 28% to 29%. Closing out the underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 86% for the quarter compared with 88.8% for the prior year quarter. Turning to investments. Net investment income was $165 million for the quarter. The (inaudible) investment portfolio, primarily investment funds, provided strong results. Our core portfolio improved despite the low interest rate environment. On a full year basis, our investment income of $672 million is only a few million dollars lower than our record reported in 2018.\nWe continue to maintain a highly liquid portfolio with a duration of 2.4 years and maintained a high credit quality of AA-. Operating cash flows remained strong throughout the year with a record level of almost $2.2 billion for the full year. Pretax net investing in the quarter was driven by increased unrealized gains in our equity portfolio, contributing to the full year results of $107 million. The full year realized gains included the sale of a private equity investment and real estate property sales.\nThe effective tax rate was 17% in the current quarter, which largely benefited from a lower foreign effective tax rate and investments in [taxi] securities and dividend-paying equity securities, along with closing certain examinations with tax authorities and truing up our prior year tax accrual. Stockholders' equity increased to almost $6.7 billion as of year-end after returning capital of $200 million in the quarter and $478 million for the full year. The company repurchased 0.75 million shares throughout the year at an average prior share of $69.85.\nBook value per share before dividends and share repurchases increased 3% in the quarter and 12.5% on a full year basis. The annualized return on beginning of year equity for the quarter was 18.7% and 16.2% for the full year. With that, I'll conclude my remarks and turn it back to Rob.\n\nW. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director\n\nRich, thank you very much. So just a couple of quick observations from me and as promised, we'll move on to the Q&A. But clearly, the line continues to be very healthy by any measurement. We like the balance that we see between rate versus exposure growth at 1/3, 2/3. I would tell you that, that's sort of what it all adds up to when we put all the pieces together. But we look at this at a very granular level. We're looking at it by line, by exposure by territory. And again, we're trying to make sure that we have the right balance there. Long story short, really, essentially across the board, we have the -- it's all about specialty business these days.\nAnd we have the right people, with the right expertise whether it's on the commercial line side, admitted or nonadmitted, whether it's domestic or international or certainly would not want to leave out our colleagues on the high (inaudible) side. We are firing on basically all cylinders. Also on the top line, Rich touched on this, I would just mention, we do have (inaudible) to the workers' common (inaudible).\nWe think there still are opportunities there, but one needs to be very cautious. The growth that you see in that line, as Rick commented, is really being driven by payroll growth. Off the board, everywhere else, it's pretty much just really healthy growth as a result of the broader environment. The log show, Rich covered this, I would just add my two cents the 60.4% or the [58.2] if you want to slip on the rose-colored glasses, that's fine. But I think one of the things that we work very hard at is making sure that we peel back a few layers and really understand what's going on in the business.\nSo one of the things -- and I know we've talked about this in past calls that I wanted to flag for people. And that is the paid loss ratio. And the paid loss ratio for the year of '21 was at 45.2%. (inaudible) That was a 56.9%; '18 was 57.5%; '19 was a 55.2%; '20 was 51.9%. And then, of course, you can see the meaningful progress in '21. And again, that was pretty stable quarter-to-quarter. The expenses, Rich touched on that. We still are getting some benefit, if you will, from the lack of travel as a result of COVID, though that is starting to pick up a bit.\nI would say really what's driving it more than anything else is the growth in the earned premium. And as the business continues to grow, we're going to see the benefits on multiple fronts, including the expense piece. So long story short, the underwriting is looking really good. And as I commented earlier, there's a lot of momentum. And as we look at January, and we're looking at submissions and where it looks like things are coming out. There is nothing that leads us to believe that the environment is not stable or perhaps improving, and we're very encouraged by that.\nWe touched on already, and Rich offered a few comments on the investment portfolio, but I would just flag for those that are interested, not to underestimate the leverage that exists in our economic model. We have, again, been very disciplined on many fronts, including the investment portfolio and the duration as rates move up and we take that duration out and the book yield moves up. I think one should not underestimate what that means for the earnings power of the business.\nAnd of course, that alongside with the underwriting margin and the health of that and the scale of the business overall, I think, bodes well for the foreseeable future. So I'm going to pause there. And let's pivot over to Q&A and talk about what you all would like to talk about. Josh, if we could please open it up for questions."
